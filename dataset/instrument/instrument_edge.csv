332,460,4.0,"Not much to write about here, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. filters out the pop sounds. now my recordings are much more crisp. it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing,"
841,460,4.0,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"
563,460,4.0,"The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it."
1043,460,4.0,Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops. Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.
194,460,4.0,This pop filter is great. It looks and performs like a studio filter. If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.
1024,703,4.0,"I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at."
1066,703,2.0,I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.
269,703,4.0,Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug.
466,703,4.0,Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time. You cant go wrong with Monster Cables.
534,744,3.0,I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.
749,744,2.0,"If you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano, it may appear little awkward."
960,744,4.0,"I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone"
1052,744,4.0,I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard. It does just what I wanted it to do.
1084,744,1.0,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
587,780,3.0,"This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out."
536,780,4.0,"I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-"
879,780,4.0,Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...
1304,780,3.0,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
363,780,3.0,Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.
171,382,4.0,"When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer. For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect."
610,382,3.0,Cant go wrong. Great quality on a budget price  - Hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up
566,382,4.0,"Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.  This one is a good product and works just fine"
1276,208,3.0,The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.
1184,208,4.0,I bought these to go from my board to the amp. We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating. They are still going strong.
372,208,4.0,"Sturdy cord and plugs, inexpensive, good value. I don't require professional-level equipment, so this cord serves my purposes well. Satisfied with purchase."
19,208,4.0,"Use it every week at gigs.  Solid, no problems with the solder joints.  A good quality cable at a very good price."
902,208,3.0,"Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough."
1213,208,4.0,This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.
1373,208,4.0,I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable.
302,208,3.0,This cable seems like it will last me for a while. As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do.
415,208,3.0,"These are not the greatest but they're cheap and they get to you fast when you need them. I've only had one fail and I've bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio.Amazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio, video, computers or concert lighting.Good music to all!"
88,208,3.0,"This is a fine cable at a decent price point, nothing exceptional mind, but it gets the job done well enough."
209,208,3.0,"I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money."
67,208,4.0,"Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp."
882,827,4.0,Good quality cable and sounds very good
1371,827,4.0,"Zero issues with this cable so far.  It feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in, unplugging, and packing between practice spaces.I'll update this review if/when it breaks."
731,827,4.0,Realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar.I have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well
171,827,3.0,"This is a very nice cable for the price. I already bent one end of it though, fortunately it still works fine. Inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic. Haven't noticed any hum or crackles. For sure a good buy."
388,827,4.0,"Seems sturdy enough, and no noise issues, so I'm pretty much satified with it; it doesn't leave the house so I'm not asking it to handle a lot, but with reasonable care it should last a while."
821,827,4.0,"I'm not a professional, but have been playing for many, many years.  This is the best cord I've ever had, though I'm sure Eric Clapton has something better."
511,827,4.0,"This Hosa Cable is very well made, with good quality connectors and a nice long length. My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected. This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around.The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1126,827,1.0,"I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.  Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.  Wire frayed at the right angle jack.  You get what you pay for."
965,827,4.0,"Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar. It seems to work well, no issues in the first couple of weeks."
888,827,0.0,"It hums, crackles, and I think I'm having problems with my equipment.  As soon as I use any of my other cords then the problem is gone.  Hosa makes some other products that have good value.  But based on my experience I don't recommend this one."
1204,827,3.0,"I am not hard on cables.  I typically just plug them in to my guitar, dont move around much, and play for an hour or two a day.  this one seem to perform just fine.  no buzz, and/or other noises noted.  I have several of them and they have all performed well."
750,827,4.0,"I have found Hosa cables to be an excellent value. More expensive cables may be more rugged, but for the price, I'm very happy with the Hosa's I have purchased."
300,827,2.0,"Works for practice ... it's a guitar instrument cable, what can I say ... maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose."
670,827,4.0,"These cables have taken a beating the last few months, and have served me well with no problems..Real metal ends, not molded on, with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors.."
335,827,4.0,In my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around. From experience they tend to just die without notice. I have a feeling this one will last a long time. It is built sturdy and sounds really good.I recommend this product.
604,827,4.0,Hosa guitar cables work great. Never had any problems with them. I own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect.
649,827,4.0,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price.  I have absolutely no complaints.  This is my first experience with the brand and I am not disappointed.
78,827,4.0,"Good quality guitar cord.Very low noise, repairable, effective strain releaf,thick rubber cover!! This is a great buy, under 10 bucks for a quality cord.Of course I just got it..it might not be durable but it looks durable.If I change my mind about anything I will update my review.For now, I would say, buy one!!Joe"
953,827,4.0,"This is a good solid cable with no problems. When I'm on stage, I like a longer cable but at practice I don't need all the extra length tangleing up on everything..."
452,827,4.0,This guitar cable is very nice.  It looks high quality and has the white ends.  Fantastic deal for this cable.
437,827,4.0,This amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price
302,827,2.0,...unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights. These are no different. I would prefer to use cables with better shielding but cannot justify the expense considering how rarely these things get used.
958,827,2.0,"It's a cable, no frills, tangles pretty easy and due to it's design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should"
660,827,4.0,"I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise, this is an excellent cable, with good build quality and a strong, thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables, and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm, guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over, try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
896,827,2.0,"One end was loose, so I tightened it, it keeps coming loose so I had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads, hope I don't ever have to open the end for repair."
151,827,3.0,"For the price, fantastic.They do feel light and I don't trust the build quality at the key stress points (where cable meets connector), but then again I am not going to push it.Set your guitar down on it by accident when it's plugged in and...who knows.But for seven bucks it gets the job done. Recommended if you are doing the ""beginner"" thing and testing the waters.Otherwise, spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting."
495,827,4.0,"Hosa makes good stuff, this is no exception. I've trusted them for years, I can't think if a single Hosa cable I've owned that's failed."
624,827,3.0,Only complaint is the size which is my fault. If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage.
368,827,4.0,"Hard to day too much, but it works great. No issues to speak of. It does the job perfectly well"
860,827,4.0,"For the price, this works really well. I see no faults. It can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now."
44,827,4.0,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
1328,827,4.0,I was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i'm glad with HOSA quality. It feels reliable and without adding noise.
188,827,4.0,"very sturdy, high quality with little to no feedback, i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it"
915,827,4.0,"Unless you're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords, these will do for any medium sized venue."
1201,827,4.0,"I have many lengths of these Hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them.I am not an active musician, so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage; so I cannot comment on thistype of usage.In my over 40 years (10 of them on stage) I have come to realize, thatyou should ALWAYS have extra cables (just like strings) with you, aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down."
1297,827,0.0,"I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!"
172,827,4.0,Works great on my 100 watt Amp. Almost compares to a monster cable. And with Its length Its plenty of Room from your Guitar to amp. GOOD PRODUCT!
216,657,2.0,"It is a decent cable. It does its job, but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned. The mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth. The switch is also loose. The connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed.'I would not recommend using this cable for critical applications. It would be more suited to home or hobby use."
315,657,4.0,the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended
677,657,4.0,"Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected. What can you say about an adapter cord?  It is well made, good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb."
320,657,3.0,"If you're like me, you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PC.It works fine for the handy type recorders.But forget hooking this directly to a PC.  Way too much noise."
566,657,4.0,"Well made, XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini.  Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job."
564,801,4.0,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
516,801,4.0,"First, the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8"" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it, and the XLR end is a quality component.I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in myPowerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. Systeminto something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.Another reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. It's a bit pricier than others I considered, but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium."
989,801,4.0,I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1. This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. I own several of these and love them.I highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. Also check out Hosa's sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter.
1406,801,3.0,"Well made. Works as it should. However, seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800. (more than the usual expected)To see if it was the Mic, cable, or adapter; Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorder.Seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR input.No big surprises. Minor clean up in post."
1227,584,3.0,"Haven't used it yet but if it's like the other cables I have from the same company, it should work fine."
316,584,4.0,Great stereo sound out of the keyboards.My keys had a single 1/4&#34; stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm. I highly recommend this cable.
1013,584,4.0,"When I ordered these I wasn't expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10-foot cable.  It turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all.  I plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static, interference or buzz to explain the low price and all I got was a nice, clean signal.  Highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable."
162,584,4.0,"These are solid cables -- tight fit in receptacles, no introduction of noise, and no discernible loss of signal. Especially considering the price, these are brilliant. I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good, but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren't sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable, and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices."
614,584,4.0,"On my mixer, I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip, return on the ring, and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4"" TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
302,584,4.0,"I still operate in an analog environment quite often, so I end up using lots of inserts. I have 8 channels of compression, limiter, gate and expander, plus various EQs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels. I have an insert snake that I use as well, but the individual insert cables (of differing lengths) that I carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show!"
923,326,4.0,I play my I-pod through a small guitar Amp.  Great way to wake up the kids.  Works perfectly for the purpose.  Keep in mind small end for I-Pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono.  If needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else.
468,326,4.0,"I bought a few of these to hook iPods/iPhones to live stage sound systems, most of which are not in stereo anyway, so why use stereo-to-mono adapters or 2 separate channels when it's not needed? Perfect solution, seems durable."
340,326,4.0,"I carry this in my bass gig bag so I can plug my phone into the mono aux-input on the back of my Genz Benz bass head. Handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement (my bass cab is full range fEARful 15/6/1). Before picking this up, I used a couple of cables / adapters to go from stereo 1/8&#34;  to mono 1/4&#34; and it often seemed I never had quite what I needed on hand."
132,326,3.0,"This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded, etc.For the price and intent, I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes, this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)"
1249,326,4.0,"Cables are cables. They usually all work. And with Amazon, you will always find the best deals for the same quality."
1290,200,4.0,"Picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard, and I couldn't be happier. Doesn't suck tone, cables are sturdy, and they sound great. This replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board."
1326,200,3.0,"This L Jack is good enough to make connections between my guitar pedals and it works fine. Flexible enough. I don't like only the fact that it's made out of plastic and it looks cheap, but for the price i paid for it i don't really care."
703,200,3.0,"These little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches, right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude, would I recommend these? Yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
226,200,4.0,"If you need some 6"" cables to connect your pedals, look no farther. These cables are perfect. They deliver good sound, are very small, and very cheap. What more could you ask for?!"
485,200,4.0,"Good little connector cable.  Well constructed, durable, built to last.  I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes. Worth it."
1184,200,4.0,"These are great cables. The only con I could give is if they go bad...no opening up the ends to fix them, but in my experience they are durable. Most people are using these on a pedal board so there's not a lot of movement to wear them down."
568,200,3.0,"Works just fine, great for little spaces between one pedal to another, if there's more distance, better use another type, bue generally works fine and it's a good quality product, clean signal no problems"
901,200,4.0,"exactly what I needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp...do yourself a favor, always order threw Amazon dealers! I placed an order threw onlinecarstereo.com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co....their customer reviews were terrible, yet I made the mistake of placing n order...right before my eyes they changed their BAD reviews to add good ones...."
759,200,4.0,These are great patch cables especially for the price. They don't suck any tone they are reliable(I've had mine for 2 years)and are really great for players on a budget.
176,200,3.0,"these cable came super fast in the mail, They deliver the level of performance you would expect form low cost cables. they work"
953,200,4.0,This is a very good cable. I don't forsee having any problems with it. It's just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables. If you need this get it. The price is right and shipping was right on time.
1309,200,4.0,"This is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget.  It works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected."
777,200,4.0,"Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together. As of yet, i havent had one go all crackly, which, considering they get frequent use, is pretty good. Often, cheap cords die within a year or so. Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things, and this one in particular is cheap and accessible. I probably have around twelve of them.Enjoy!"
245,200,4.0,Hosa patch cables are the best for the buck. Great sound and flexible. I'm a firm Hosa cable fan. Love these little guys.
320,200,4.0,These have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can't.
1354,250,3.0,"I bought 6 of these XLR to 1/4&#34; adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer I owned with 1/4&#34; inputs.  It didn't end up working because I discovered I needed to convert the microphone level to line level (which these don't do), however they do convert XLR to 1/4&#34; balanced quite well.  Just not what I needed in my particular situation."
1267,250,4.0,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4"" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4"" stereo... It's high quality, and very solid, I definately expect this to last me a long time."
1400,250,4.0,"I purchased this to work with my ION system and my shure mic. Arrived as expected, very solid great fit. It works!!!!"
1164,250,4.0,This has come in handy many times in my studio Z108.net. We love having it around. Good quality affordable price.
213,250,3.0,"As the title says, it works.  The only reason I took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and I have to use some force to get it off the XLR.  But, no issues besides that."
1181,250,3.0,"This converts an xlr signal (for me, a Shure SM57 mic) into a 1/4 male (I run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp).  Have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that.  Could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall."
88,250,4.0,Its affordable and it works.  Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input.
55,250,4.0,"For the price, can't beat it.  Works as well as any $15 - $20 one I would have bought at local guitar stores."
699,250,4.0,Just a basic female XLR to 1/4 inch male adapter. I use these so I can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard/practice all in one PA.
1354,864,3.0,"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand."
665,864,4.0,As expected from Hosa another great product.  Solid construction and great sound reproduced.  i would recomed this product to everyone.
1161,864,3.0,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it, plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack, Best Buys no where else, I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself, but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way, I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards,ffsalsa"
305,864,4.0,"This is a solid product. I ended up not needing it so... I returned it. However, it worked fine and gets the job done."
989,864,4.0,"This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once."
1296,710,4.0,"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks, which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing, both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating, cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no, Andy does not own stock in, have affiliation with, or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I."
1210,710,4.0,"I bought this product to use on my amp pots. It restored the sound,power and clearity of my amps.It doesn't evaporate right away, but after a couple of minutes your good to go!"
536,710,4.0,"Before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar, stomp box or amp, try this.  95% of the time, this will take care of the problem.  If your amp cuts in and out, also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1/4&#34; jack in and out of the socket a dozen times.  The very first can I bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over.  Good stuff !"
668,710,4.0,"I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can."
1262,710,4.0,"This stuff works great and is well worth the price, I used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals, no more scratchiness, no more jarring volume spikes, all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new, I'll always keep a can of this around, nothing more to say, great stuff."

895,122,3.0,"The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord... I ordered both at the same time, other than that they are good hot mics..."
318,122,3.0,"As a freelancer, I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest, performing on a near-weekly basis.  These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It's all about money to them.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's.  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.I'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important ""gear component.""  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?"
1354,677,3.0,"I bought this cable for my band's live show setup.  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application.  While not the best quality cable, the length and price make it a good value for the money, especially if you're buying several at a time.  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live, they're fine.  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.  If you're only going to buy one, I'd look into Canare or Mogami, they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price."
1107,677,3.0,If they're used for live performances they will not last very long! Good for the price. I need to resolder the ends after a concert though.
909,677,4.0,"There's nothing complicated about this purchase. It's a cable. It works. It doesn't cost a lot. It's a great deal. Get it.I use it every week, and it still sounds perfect. Then, again, I never mistreat my equipment."
1086,677,3.0,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
423,677,3.0,I've had this cable for awhile and I'm not too impressed with the quality. The plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin. I use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn't had much of a workout. I don't think it would hold up long on stage at a venue.
1168,677,2.0,These cables are a little thin compared to hosa and GLS. They picked up a little interference from other equipment as well. Guessing they are lacking some shielding.
988,554,3.0,"The Gain on this mic isn't the greatest, but for speeches and soft recordings: this guy can handle it all very well!"
751,554,3.0,"I have a few Shure SM58s which cost more.  I like the open sound of the PG48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the SM58s.  I like this mic ok but the SM58 is worth the extra money I think, especially if you expect to push its capability."
535,554,4.0,I only do test recording with this digitally to get a better Idea of my learning process from the other side. It gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw I have.
333,554,4.0,"I use this for Video Exchanges on a guitar instruction website. It's perfect for vocals, podcasting, video recording and so forth. Shure makes excellent stuff. What's also great is you save some money as an XLR cable is included. I'm very happy with this purchase."
1366,554,3.0,"4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing won't tune your guitar or carry your amp. I use this solo, in a duo with a bass player, in a trio with drums and bass. I have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room. I use it through a Pyle Pro self contained Pa into which I also plug my Martin GRP elec/acoustic. The sound quality is excellent. The volume seems limited only bny what the Pyle Pro will put out. I would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and PA. I haven't heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.The 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to. I bought a 32&#34; Toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks, Think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less. The same is true of a lot of Audio Gear. A lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it's great to have a company like Shure make something so good and so affordable. They have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford. I cannot recommend it strongly enough."
345,895,3.0,"It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Here's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.I didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58."
806,895,4.0,This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar. I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely. I don't think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need. Built to last and it is a Shure.
1169,895,4.0,"Just got this, have used it for recording and rehearsal, it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years.  Right now, though, I'd say great product."
423,895,3.0,"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58, but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree."
318,895,3.0,"I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and ""clean"" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the ""digital audio workstation"" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear). Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole."
309,895,4.0,good mic for simple live stuff that isn't too expensive.  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things
728,610,4.0,This is a proven classic.  Using it to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet.  Sounds fantastic and is solidly built.
456,610,4.0,"This is the #1 mic you should get, recording or live, instruments or voice, it always come through  with a great sound and seems almost indestructible.looking forward to work with it on future projects, can't believe it took me so long to get one of those"
111,610,4.0,"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a ""Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.""  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen."
142,610,4.0,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
828,610,4.0,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums, its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor, PG seies, digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
213,610,4.0,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't, it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic, I use it for instruments, vocals, even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here."
302,610,3.0,I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets. It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most. I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine. As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics.
1265,610,4.0,"I use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals.  I've knocked this microphone around a decent amount, and it is plenty rugged.  I couldn't be happier with it."
968,610,3.0,"This mic is well made (heavy on the mic-end).  However, I have yet to try it with my multi-track studio."
761,3,4.0,"I bought this for my teen son for Christmas. He loves to play his bass and sing along. He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model. Nice and clean sounds, plus it seems pretty sturdy. We did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put. Shure knocked this one out of the park."
1247,3,4.0,these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs... an all around tough mic....great for all your needs...I highly recommend them..
644,3,4.0,"The industry standard for live performance, the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason. These are the only microphones that I perform with, and the on/off switch makes it easier so I don't have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicing...I just turn the mic off."
371,3,3.0,"It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing. Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks."
1006,3,3.0,"How do you review an SM58?? I've used these most of my life, and will continue to. Very durable, I got this to replace the same, a 20 year old, rusted / dented grill 58 :) I also use a D5 (AKG - same price) and a line 6 wirelesss, but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup."
325,3,4.0,"legendary performance indeed! works perfectly, extremely easy to set up, very good sound, good price, that's 'bout all you need to know!"
1241,3,4.0,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills, tough as nails, and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals, this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail, or get up close for some bass response, or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic, 25-ft cable, cable tie, carry pouch, and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra."
1400,3,4.0,no complaints here! the quality is great! the sounds is excellent! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp. use it all the time.
910,3,4.0,A nice addition to my recording home studio!  I recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music.
302,3,3.0,This mic works better for some people than others. That being said it is the first mic I put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them. If it doesn't sound good then I try something else. I have no complaints it is my GO TO MIC.
1068,3,3.0,"I bought two microphones, a AKG D5 and SM58.  I like AKG D5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the AKG.The SM sounded muted compared to D5 without any sound modification out of box.  The output is also a little less sensitive than the D5.However I like the look of SM58 and it seems to be extremely durable."
943,3,3.0,"In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television, the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. As a frame of reference, theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic, theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal."
318,3,4.0,"I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58.  I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4"" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of ""private"" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of ""this seller.""  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]"
968,3,3.0,"The mic is well made (heavy on the &#34;mic&#34; end), but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi-track studio."
1081,229,4.0,"This is a well made, low noise and low cost cable. Unless you make a lot of money with your recordings, this will do just fine!"
1073,229,4.0,"Didn't know what to expect for under $10, but it proved to be worth the gamble.This cable appears to be well constructed and it works fine for me(amateur use, infrequent setup/teardowns).It's a decent 15 feet long, and has a locking button on the female end.I'm quite happy with it."
587,229,3.0,"I use this cable for small home recording projects. I do not take the cable around to gigs or shows, as I am pretty sure it wouldn't last longer than a few months of heavy use. The sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy. If your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job, this is your product."
371,229,0.0,"Received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. Since I was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today."
1184,229,0.0,"These things are terrible. One wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. Plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this."
888,229,3.0,Pay a couple bucks more and you get one from a brand like Audio Technica and you know it's going to withstand the test of time.  Mine is working fairly well but the attachments are loosening so who knows what's next.
614,229,4.0,"Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another.  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.As for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells ""it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!"" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of ""what if"" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console."
895,229,4.0,This is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord... It's no PEAVEY but it works just as good...
872,229,3.0,"The product feels a little on the ""cheap"" side, but definitely does the job the way it should- so that's all I care about. It was cheap, and came fast. I recommend it."
1391,229,4.0,I bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine.  There doesn't seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last.  They do what they're supposed to do.
677,229,3.0,"This was one of two I purchased. Also bought the 25' Length and used them on an assignment recently.  They fit my RODE Mic nice and tight, other cords I have bought didn't and the sound quality is excellent. If Amazon allowed a link I would give you a link to a video I just finished on the Independence of the Seas.  Go to my website and look for it...IPA IMPRESS dot Com"
1050,229,3.0,"No complaints, it's quiet enough and the price is right. Is it a Monster cable? No, but it doesn't cost as much either. I've used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine."
478,229,4.0,well made and the perfect length for my needs. the shielding was great as well. the end connectors were well made and strong.
833,229,3.0,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires, of course, the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them, I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
1176,229,4.0,"Like most products on the market, depending on where and how the item is used, your experience may vary. For me, this cable is going to be used on a semi-stationary mic stand in my project studio, and thus far, it's done nothing but an exceptional job. I tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario, the signal was just as strong as the some of the other, more pricey cables out there. Would I purchase this again? Absolutely!"
1049,229,4.0,"The extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability.  Cord works well and hasn't been any problem, to date.  Plugs directly to the system, or my mini-amp.  Works well."
431,229,4.0,"I have to tell you guys, these XLR cables that I have received recently are by far the best quality cables I have ever encountered in my entire music (professional) life.I would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues."
1081,750,4.0,Got a packet to try but I found they are better than the Gator screws that came with my case! My equipment is very secure. Highly recommended.
316,750,4.0,They are screws. They screw in and hold things. To say that they did less would've gotten the 1 star. I like them.
15,750,3.0,Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment.  Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice.
1412,750,4.0,Excellent rack screws with washers. Its fit very good to rack holes. Good presentation and well packed. I will buy again.
1033,750,4.0,So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack. There are exactly as described and do the job. What more can a guy say about a little box of screws? Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action?
837,750,4.0,"Pros:* They look very nice.* They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers.Cons:* More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship.I'd purchase these again, but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled."
828,750,4.0,"Donr be fooled by the imitations... should be their slogan. There are some real junky ones out there and these are great, love the washers, life savers. Thanks!"
167,750,4.0,"Great rack mount screws. Rubber washers are perfect, lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon. I use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile DJ equipment and they have held strong."
87,750,4.0,"Other than that, when you need 10-32 rack screws, these are the real McCoy.  Wide enough pan to grab the ear, narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear!  Thanks, Raxxess!"
1335,750,4.0,"There are other rack screws out there, but Raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available."
661,750,4.0,Well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack.  They work.
742,300,4.0,"Mics are like pants, you have to find the right fit. This one I like for my vocals live. I sing fairly low and airy - works great for me. Also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live, very sweet sound. I prefer it to the 58, seems a bit more bright and natural. Might purchase another one eventually..."
1373,300,4.0,Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac? This is the industries best mic as far as I am concerned. I had a Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a SM58. SM 58 is garbage compared to the Beta 58A. Spring for the extra bucks and be happy. That's what I always say.
1146,300,4.0,"Yes, it costs considerably more than the SM58 and I'm not sure if I could pass a comparison test between the two, but I love this mic!  To me, it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s I have used in the past.  If you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet, get the 58.  If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the Beta.  I would buy this again."
69,300,4.0,"I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me, it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)"
1403,300,4.0,"The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards, that's well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.""Built like a tank"" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what."
600,506,4.0,"I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the ""perceived"" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off."
536,506,2.0,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes.  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make.  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs, but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure, true bypass, sturdier inputs and knobs, and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem."
1200,506,4.0,"When I first started setting up my little studio, I wanted something that didn't break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (Digitech 500, Boss ME-70), but quickly realized I wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left, I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building, and they all got put away.  Lately, I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series, they are not so hot.  Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt, or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo.  You will NOT be sorry!"
275,506,3.0,"Hello Musicfriends - This is built cheap but sounds great. Good controls too. For me in the studio/songwriting  its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it..... There is something about the knobs I still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it... may be  the age thing..."
551,506,3.0,"it sounds great.  nice and warm and lush.  one of the better trems i've had the pleasure to use.  however, i hate the plastic housing, and how the input/output jacks are located.  I don't have heavy feet, so it will probably last a good long while on my board, but i really wouldn't want to put too much weight on it."
841,264,4.0,"It is exactly what you need in a capo! You can cover all six strings, move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo (though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down.).All in all, a great capo that is well made and will last forever.Kyser is an awesome small Christian company and I really like their products and supporting them with my purchases. :]"
240,264,4.0,Love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours.  Prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses.
1010,264,3.0,"The title says it all.  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store.  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove.  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used.  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  And best of all... it works!"
464,264,4.0,"I like it, it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar. And it looks good. Overall, I recommend."
1261,264,4.0,"Quick to clip on and off. Really... Is there anything else to say? What else do you want it to do?These suckers are wonderfully reliable.I've had one for about 10 years. The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the ""bottom"" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect. However, for a $1, keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them. Can you go wrong? NO!Great product!"
170,264,3.0,a couple of bucks more than dunlop...which i have not tried..i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case..but it works fine..and is well made...arrived on time..enjoy
150,264,4.0,"This Capo looks great and does the job. It does take a bit of pressure to open the camp, but its better then the winding versions."
1022,264,4.0,"Purchased the 6-string Kyser capo when I meant to get the 12-string version (slightly longer, stronger spring?), but find that this 6-string Capo not only works great on my 2 6-string acoustics, but also works on my 12-string acoustic with a little adjusting.  Quality seems top notch, design is simple and effective."
565,264,4.0,I've owned the same one for 10 years and it's still going strong after many gigs. The spring tension is just right.
1094,264,4.0,Basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion.  I have big hands which may be part of it.
118,264,4.0,"high quality hassle free design.  Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  Very happy with this purchase."
1177,264,3.0,"I have had one for two years and no complaints, needed another for my travel guitar.  The lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck, the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension. Finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple.  I take particular caution to make sure that I don't leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently..."
360,264,4.0,I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!
1133,264,4.0,"It is very well made, is easy to use, and holds down the strings just fine.  It is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar."
743,264,3.0,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
1313,264,4.0,Easy to useGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thank you very much
189,264,3.0,"Got what I needed - a basic capo for a good price.  The tension is a little tighter than I'd like, but works for me.  Covers all strings, and depresses them fully.  I don't use it often, so I can't speak to its longevity, but good for me!"
1120,264,4.0,"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home"
871,264,1.0,"The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it."
321,264,2.0,What's to say?  It's not a high end capo and for the price I can lose it ( like most of the other capos I have owned).  It's not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly.
645,264,4.0,"This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you don't put it on right. When used correctly though, it does it's job just fine."
833,264,4.0,"I can only repeat what everyone else has already said: this Kyser capo is designed and built very well. It's easy to put on and adjust, and just as easy to take off. There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier, but this is still pretty stylish. And the price makes it a real bargain."
535,544,4.0,I bought a 12 string one in blk.  Love it for simplicity and needed it so I didn't have to keep searching for the other.  Got gold to remind me it is for six strings.
157,544,4.0,"I have used a few different capo's this is far and away my favorite. Very easy to take it off, holds the strings tight. What more can you ask for? Does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive."
675,544,4.0,It does what it says. It a Kyser Quick Change capo. This capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry. Highly recommended.
1212,544,3.0,"It's a capo... nice fit... yet, sometimes I wonder if it fits too tightly, as when I use it, and of course the strings are tighter, sometimes I feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight...yet, it is a capo, structured very well."
442,544,4.0,I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets. I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap $5 capo before. This is well worth your pay :)
338,544,4.0,My husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar. His old one lasted about 10 years. Worth the cost.
1150,544,4.0,These Capos are wonderful. Perfect all the way around! long lasting and backed up by the company. I have three!
1259,544,4.0,"I bought this Capo for myWashburn D10. It works on my Orlando classical guitar as well. I wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn't too expensive - and the Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits the bill nicely:[Update 7/25/10: My Orlando guitar was stolen. Boo Hoo!!!]- Easy On, Easy OffThe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off.- Rubberized ClampsRubberized clamps helps prevent the Kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets.- ErgonomicThe arched arm with the weird-looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the Kyser Capo.- DurableThe Kyser is made from durable aluminum.[Update 7/25/10] I've had this capo for almost 3 years and it's still working like a champ! (According to Amazon's Instant Order Update for moi, I got this capo on  November 22, 2007.)- The Same Capo Colbie Caillat Used in BubblyCheck out the music video! It's the same capo Colbie Caillat used inBubbly!---The Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo is excellent! I don't think you can go wrong with this one!"
777,544,3.0,"I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these, and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market."
429,544,3.0,"Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well.. Not sure that it's as good as the G7th capo, which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job."
883,544,4.0,"I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome. I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made, it sounds really really good. The capo is very easy to use as well."
307,544,2.0,"The description says the color is gold.  It's not.  More of a greenish yellow, but does what it is intended for.  I think I would stick with the black color though."
90,544,3.0,"I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. However, I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example, I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect."
713,544,4.0,"works great. Just clip it on and jam out.forget the screw on type, and spend the few extra bux for this one.  you'll be happier, trust me."
309,544,4.0,"i got pink cause nobody would steal it, and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great"
765,544,4.0,"This capo is awesome, it looks and feels very nice and premium, it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for."
799,18,3.0,These Martin strings (M170) aren't bad. They just are not the sound I was looking for. I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead. The Martin's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball. Other people will love them though. They are easy to play.
409,18,4.0,"These are good for the average guitar player who doesn't want to much strain or pain on there fingers. Not the fullest tone, but you wouldn't expect that with extra light strings."
471,18,4.0,"I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.I have installed a set (I got 8) and it sounds really good. Not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.Recomended"
1133,18,3.0,"Martin makes great sounding strings.  I decided to use Light Martin strings (.12) because they sounded louder and better, and I could play them just as easy as the lighter strings."
561,18,4.0,Strings are not just strings. Guitar strings are another very important part of playing GREAT Guitar. And all Martin products are second to none.
211,18,4.0,"I replaced a set of strings that were very used with these Martins.  They are, as named, very light.  They are easy on my fingers and give great tone.  Quality company, great strings, great price!"
155,18,4.0,"I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar. this strings have good sound and hold a tune well. the best thing is the price is great. Like I said I am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard, but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed."
580,18,4.0,these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven I use them all the time
816,18,4.0,Good strings with good sound.The Extra Light is easier on the fingers - but they sound thinner too.Go for the Light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure.
373,461,3.0,"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter."
75,461,3.0,These are okay strings for the Folk Guitar.............nothing special but the price isn't out of the world either. Good buy for the money. Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good.
65,461,4.0,"I am yet another one of those ""Forever Beginners"" when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!"
295,461,4.0,"I restrung my Martin 0-16NY with these strings and found them to be excellent.  As a new guitarist,the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound."
896,461,4.0,"Even though these are folk strings, I put them on my 35 year old dread and they sound really good.I hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate.I also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing.So far so good"
277,461,3.0,"I love these strings.  I bought a set awhile back for my Ovation, but never used them.  Then I came into possession of an old Yamaha acoustic guitar which was pretty beat up and needed new strings.  I put these suckers on there and wow was I impressed.  Even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings.  So... I bought another set for the Ovation this time!"
353,53,3.0,I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks.
449,53,3.0,I love the idea that you don't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick. Further it will not add something else to find/loose in my pants pocket.
700,53,2.0,"After buying this product, I have concluded that $8.00 is a lot of money for foam! Does the job, but I think the velcro job would be preferable to this one."
694,53,4.0,"It's a lot smaller than the picture makes it look, but that's a good thing. It serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock."
1088,53,3.0,"I'm using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks. It was smaller then I would have pictured, but it still is a good product. It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off. Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in. Besides that, its highly recommendable to anyone. I will definitely pick up more for my other axes."
1271,53,3.0,"Not too much to say, it's made out of foam, made to slip between the strings, made to hold two picks.  I have several of these, for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged, still, it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My son's guitar teacher calls this a ""fancy little pick holder"" and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful, my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
1139,53,3.0,"I use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar. Got tired of losing picks in mid jam, digging through pockets, scavenging for another pick. Now it's right there."
674,53,4.0,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar, as I often find myself playing with fingers, then suddenly a ""pick song"" starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it, and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick, but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it, but the ""spreading strings"" on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So, still highly recommended if your headstock has a ""straight through"" design, not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
581,53,3.0,"This thing does just what it was supposed to, i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that, and it does just what it is supposed to"
1171,53,4.0,"I was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly, but it seems to have no affect at all. Super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain, but just take it off when recording. Very handy to have two picks with you at all times. It's great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitar's finish. Me likey!! Price can't be beat either!"
623,201,4.0,"I've played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old, progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars, and a few electric Fender and Gibson units.... All good in their own respect.I decided to treat myself to a Les Paul for my 58th birthday but, not having the financial resources to buy a $3,000.00 git, I shopped and shopped... Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP-100.It arrived in perfect condition, the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. It was even ""sorta"" in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.Simply put, Nice guitar. After allowing the strings and neck to settle in together, I spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height, intonation, and pick-up distances, and now this LP *ROCKS* !!!If you're going to spend mid-range $$$ on a fine practice / performance guitar, you can't go wrong with this one, kids - Two Thumbs Up ![Suggestion: A Fender Mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better...]"
96,201,4.0,"exactly the same as describe here, love the sound and easy to play. great price for excellent sound, highly recommend to everyone."
965,201,4.0,I bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on. She absolutely loves it. Everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it. You can't beat this for the price!!!
205,201,2.0,"This is a fine guitar, but it isn't amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.My remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34;real&#34; Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.The guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a &#34;full-sized&#34; guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again."
223,201,4.0,"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid, well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain, wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet, when I add the next guitar to my collection, it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!"
1123,201,3.0,"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again."
451,201,3.0,"I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldn't be happier.  This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it, I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels; it is really lightweight, a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried, this makes it VERY easy to play, it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely.I like it so much, that I decided to add a pair of Slash's Alnico IIs on it, that cost more than the guitar itself, this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain, good ol' crunchy-bluessy rock.Call me cheap if you want and I wouldn't care, this is one of those items that makes you wonder, how come there's others way more overpriced and just don't find a way to justify that a ""real"" Gibson Les Paul will sound $800 - $1000 better.It wasn't until recently (after 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and that's why I gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar...?  I'm sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been.  If you're learning, looking for a first electric or just want a ""practice"" axe that will not dissapoint you, just go ahead and buy it, don't give it a 2nd thought and do it."
754,201,4.0,"I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise.  I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball ""Not Even Slinky's"" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.The action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.The finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.Also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality.  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order.Overall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP.  At less than half that its a steal.If you are considering this instrument, don't hesitate."
1039,201,4.0,"Well, the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morning!Am I impressed? U bet cha!This thing is simply beautiful! It arrived well padded in a double box. Initially, I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws. NONE! Not a finger print on it anywhere! This guitar is extremely well made and put together right. It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. The neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. I put a quarter under the 10th. fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!It's considerably heaver than than I thought.  I would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. I have a strap ordered and on the way.The maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups. This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had.  Your hand floats over the frets!I don't think you could get a better piece for the price point."
439,201,4.0,"This is one awesome guitar!  I also purchased the Fender Mustang I Amp, Epiphone custom case (fits like a glove) and Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap (comfortable and very secure) which made for an UNBELIEVEABLE combination along with Rocksmith 2014.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination.  The only problem in my household is....who gets to play next."
1106,201,4.0,"Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues.  I am very happy with the guitar.  It came well padded and was in excellent shape.  It was set up well and has played well out of the box.  Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didn't have to make any adjustments to the guitar.  Played as well after the change as it did before.  Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances.  Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.  It is not a big deal to me but I thought I'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone.  When I ordered this one I wasn't really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time, I'm glad I did."
890,848,4.0,"First off, the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a ""Starter Guitar"". Trust me when I say, I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. If you're thinking aout buying this guitar, don't. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!"
528,848,4.0,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar, only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs, which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing, it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson, but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
642,848,3.0,"Purchased primarily for Rocksmith and it works very well for that.  Still learning how to play, but like the feel of this guitar.  Looks great and plays great.  Was packaged very well.  Only needed minor setup adjustments. I would recommend getting strap locks."
140,848,4.0,"I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up, dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my ""gloating"" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.  Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTIC.New rule for me, no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week!!!!!"
984,848,4.0,"Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, EbonyHello again. I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it's been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a Gibson. What's also amazing is that it's still around a $150. It's well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you. It's still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you."
937,848,4.0,"I've been playing for over 40 years. I currently own 60 or so guitars. My problem with LP's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, I've bought and sold quite a few. Another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didn't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what's not broken. Yup, I said ""on my personal guitars"" because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy, it's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. I've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument. Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar?"
407,848,2.0,Good overall but pick ups are terrible - Might be better replacing the pickups but I wasn't willing to spend the extra money
706,848,2.0,"I got this pretty fast. I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.If I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are great right out of the box usually."
1007,848,2.0,"I got one of these a while back and being like I am with guitars took it apart to see just what it's made of.Mahogany ply maybe or capped with real, but it's plywood body inside.Kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there...Otherwise decent build, basic original lp design bolt on, surprisingly good electronics w/ full size pots and open back 3 way toggle, good neck but bad tuners.... Note: any 45% mount tuners, meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 o'clock position respectively... Will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had.  So add 10$ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here.And you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with.I like the style, and though there's plywood involved still good fit and finish, though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are, only in looks.  Electric guitars don't resonate, that's why pickups are important.I don't like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys.You lose interest learning on something that can't hold good tuning.  So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that.It's likely they'll keep this style but revise it some... to be hardwood body and real tuners as I  think the price point demands it.  Otherwise a decent piece good wiring, decent pickups... But..."
313,848,4.0,"Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (It's more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. Overall, sounds and looks awesome! Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul."
1183,848,4.0,"My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years.I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4"" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesn't need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. It's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years."
516,848,4.0,"I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players. The price is right, and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year."
803,848,1.0,"The Epiphone Les Paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele. The reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. Second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high end guitar, Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still. I'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this."
629,848,4.0,"I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and I do not regret that decision.First of all, it is a beauty. Initially, I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue.) I thought I had wanted a lighter color, but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have. Second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability. It is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream. (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment I've made, or likely will make.)It's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, I've only played it unplugged. I can't wait to hear how it sounds amped up."
763,848,4.0,"I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed ""off""  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box)."
836,848,4.0,"Wow, you would have thought this was the Holy Grail when it arrived at my house.  My son practically ran to the UPS man when the truck pulled up.  He is thrilled with this guitar.  Great purchase."
1108,848,4.0,"I got this guitar at Guitar Center, i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy, so i wanted to see it in person, i saw it, i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing, its better than my other les paul special ii, this guitar plays great, its set up very nicely, the pickups are very nice, the electronics work perfectly, i have no problems with it, but the guitar is very beautiful, i would highly recommend getting it, i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same, not all guitars are made the same right?"
681,333,3.0,"A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. Genius!I bought 2 immediately. The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.Two issues to consider. The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine. It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is &#34;down there&#34;. I don't think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I dont blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do. (If you see the white edge they are &#34;quiet&#34;)"
1038,333,4.0,"This is my third circuit breaker cable. I play in church and no one wants to here the ""POP"" if I have to leave the sanctuary. Why three: 10foot, 15foot, and 20foot depending on the setup for the group - I hate cable jump rope. I really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand I use."
340,333,2.0,"Update: The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out. I've had it just over a month, so Amazon won't help me. Despite the lifetime warranty, Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund. Despite being an ""authorized retailer"" for Planet Waves, AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. I've emailed Planet Waves, but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I don't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home, so unless the manufacturer comes through, this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.I frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. I've used cables with the G&H; quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H-; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than I'm used to, which makes coiling for storage very easy, but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined. I've never given the sound of a cable a thought, being a bass player who doesn't use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments. But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 9.2 and fEARful 15/6/1 cab, I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics. The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers (Hosa, Proco, Whirlwind, etc). I've never had to warranty exchange a PW cable, but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them. I like knowing that. ** EDIT: AS STATED ABOVE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS **"
1344,333,4.0,30 feet of cable for what I paid for a 10 footer from my local guitar shop.I highly recommend!
827,333,2.0,A long time Planet Waves user I trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards... IMHO it is not.The plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip. I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar (and into the amp at the other end). The actual cable is horrible.... it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should (e.g. like my old Planet Waves cables do). They claim that the shielding is excellent but I find it to be mediocre. Very disappointing purchase.
683,333,4.0,I'd chose this cable cause I own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end. I like the idea that you can cut the power  and remove the cable from the instrument with having  mute the amp or mixer. I recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else.
1321,740,4.0,"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them. It sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space. The controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played ""boutique"" chorus pedals, and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this."
927,740,4.0,"I bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after I got my first guitar.  I've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound.  It's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want.  You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!"
1128,740,4.0,Very very good product! I have no complains about it.  Definitely a great buy and a Must have in your pedalboard.
762,740,4.0,"First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.  You HAVE to get this pedal!"
1281,740,4.0,"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
42,586,3.0,"I like the product a lot. For me, the only problem is the time of the ""sustainer effect"".It is not so long as I thought. I though it would be like the piano's sustainer. But it's a good pedal effect. My guitar get a good sound with the ""attack effect"". Thank you."
260,586,3.0,"As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again, you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as ""ACTIVE"" as this one. Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it."
549,586,3.0,"The Boss CS3 is right for me, I have been using it with excellent results, I have many compressors, Line6, MXR, Behringer, Digitech, and although I alternate their use the Boss stands out on many rig configurations, it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product, I highly recommended it as your main compressor, if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it, good luck."
1157,586,3.0,"It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds ""noise"" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, ""neutered"" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be ""expensive"" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""entry level"" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway."
1281,586,4.0,"As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the ""On"" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
227,431,4.0,"Guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless ""boutique"" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to ""stock"" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, I don't need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I haven't owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it's ""old school"" rock distortion. The usual ""may not appeal to metalheads"" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap ""boutique"" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I'd considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.  I couldn't be happier."
536,431,3.0,"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp."
818,431,4.0,"I have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound, not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does. One Volume knob, one tone, and one distortion knob. CRANK IT."
518,431,4.0,This pedal is a must have for any pedal board. I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray. Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best.
927,431,4.0,"This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago.  It's still in my primary set up!  The sound it puts out is very balanced:  you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it, or a high-gain hard rock/80's metal sound out of it.  For those looking for insane crunch, this isn't for you.  Anyone that wants a nice, versatile pedal, this IS the one you want!"
1060,431,0.0,"This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use. Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion"
1194,431,3.0,"This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing."
1304,431,4.0,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise, it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
22,431,1.0,"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""For all but the tone snobs,"" a review further down on this product's page:""Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat ""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.""I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a ""big amp"" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU."
580,431,4.0,This is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom 505 gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff. Honestly the best effect it held was the phaser/jet pipe effect. I got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted. It does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price!! bodow!!! from Trinidad!!
273,431,2.0,"This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox's. The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.This pedal doesn't replicate any type of amplifier-it's not a ""Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn't complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it. If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further. If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal.Cons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast.Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control, this would get 4 stars."
1157,431,3.0,"There's some element of nostalgia with the DS-1 that I've just never understood.  I know they're cheap.  I know they're incredibly durable (as are all BOSS pedals).  I know everybody had one or tried one at some point, and Kurt Cobain (apparently) used them with his Fenders.But I also know that I've almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal.  It's incredibly thin and harsh, and lacks proper sustain, even cranked all the way.  I've used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps.  Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers.  You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want, but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals, and even on-amp distortion, with a richer, deeper tone.Coincidentally, I also used the BOSS OS2 Overdrive/Distortion for many years, which is supposedly merges/blends a DS-1 with an OD-1.  That pedal isn't ideal either, but if I turn the knob all the way to ""distortion"", it's a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.Then again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can't really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection.  That just doesn't mean you'll want to use it all the time."
1389,431,2.0,"... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong."
504,431,4.0,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
856,431,4.0,"First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS-1 I have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal.  I have a Fender wannabe guitar, and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.(update Sept 2012)It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later."
1081,615,3.0,Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy. If you are looking for classic rock sounds you won't find them here. Can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for. I find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords. For the price this pedal is a good deal though!
616,615,3.0,"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."
1154,615,3.0,"To be honest, I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet, but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great, only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
927,615,4.0,"I have a lot of pedals...  In fact, I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won't give you a ""cranked up tube stack"" sound.  No...  Instead, it's very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... I'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close, but for the price...) with any other pedal."
957,615,4.0,"Its a great pedal, sound really crunchy, I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style, but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles, I use the heavy metal config on this pedal, I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise, I run it on the stock battery, it still works, you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth, of course it also depends on a lot of things, like pickups, amp, etc..., I also have a very old little peavey practice amp, this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website, I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them, but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S"
1249,615,4.0,"BY FAR the best distortion pedal out there. No doubt about that. Several of my friends use this pedal, and they all love it. I also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal. It's great for medal. It have a nice punch to it along with a great &#34;cut&#34; so you're palm mutes don't blend into each other like other pedals. There are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations. AMAZING"
762,615,3.0,"First of all I want to say I love a tube amp distortion.  Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board."
1114,845,4.0,Bought it as a gift. Friend loved it very much.
834,845,4.0,"I love BOSS pedals. I owned a DS-1 (Distortion) and a MT-2 (Metal Zone) for years, and loved them both. This one, is a good ""meet in the middle"" of those two. It's great if you want some really good bluesy distortion, or you can crank the color and get some thick distortion.As always, this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy. I love it."
325,845,4.0,"very simple, very user-friendly,and the feature that is most important i think, versatile. the OS/DS and drive knobs allow you to chose between a very different bunch of tones. and also, for the money, a great deal. 100% recommended."
989,845,4.0,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player."
767,846,2.0,"It's a good OD, but I thought it would be higher output, and more articulate. Just personal preference. I mean, the Pedal is a Classic for a reason."
523,846,4.0,"This thing freaking rocks! I LOVE this pedal. I can't stop using it. Sometimes I just play long, drawn out chords so I can listen to this amazing tone [in combo with distortion on my amp - it's perfect metal!!]"
304,846,4.0,excellentI like I am very happyI am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you
536,846,3.0,"For the money, I have no complaints.  The enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable.  Not true bypass, but none of the BOSS pedals are.  It doesn't suck tone.  This pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals don't. You lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with EL84s.  As a stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals.  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  You get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  Lately, I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo).  As with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp.  That's just not what it was intended to do. It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV. Because I'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) I bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price."
1396,846,3.0,"It's yellow, its metal, its Boss.  If you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get.  The best OD I have ever owned.  Makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half."
927,846,4.0,"I picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit.  It does a wonderful job of that (Drive set low and the level set high.  Tone set to taste.)  The additional noise it produces is relatively low, so you won't have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with.  As with any other Boss pedals, it's well made and reliable."
1131,846,4.0,"Bought one of these 15 yrs ago used and it died a couple years back. This is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever. Smooth tone, the right amount of gain, perfect to push a tube amp. Plus there are now dozens of (DIY or pro) mods available which add a lot more potential. Recommended."
1304,846,3.0,"I bought this pedal used and have used it with both a Fender tube amp and a Marshall solid state using clean channels. I can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars, and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection.While I have several overdrive pedals, this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end. I can get decent tones from a Telecaster and Les Psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 o'clock and adjusting the drive to taste.The OD sounds great through Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar. With some adjustment of the tone and drive knob, the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive.The other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic Boss in build quality. I find the Boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones I've owned after some time, but I may keep this one as is and use it as a boost. These pedals last forever and I only paid $20 for mine."
88,846,4.0,"This is a standard on my peral board along witht he Blues Driver.  This little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an Over Drive pedal.  It is tough, sounds like fire, and will serve you well.  For $50 there is seriously no better deal."
1158,846,4.0,I use this pedal all the time now even more than the DS-1 . Great chrunch for the buck From classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in.
1157,846,4.0,"I held out from trying the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive for many years.  Like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  It's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer, except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a ""rock"" overdrive, while the TS-9 is more of a ""tube/blues"" effect.  There's probably some truth to that, but both of them are excellent pedals.However, the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isn't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a ""booster"" pushing an already overdrive amp, or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone, and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that aren't fair.  You hear things like ""it cuts out too much bass"", when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And, like I said before, I feel as if it's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it's a Boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles.  If you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound ""big"", there are probably better options in this range.  (Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion, or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive).  But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose, you'll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years."
685,846,4.0,"Great as a booster, as others have said. For solos, it'll boost your mids and your signal. As an overdrive, it's great, kind of a midsy, Marshally sound. It does suck out some of the low end, but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever. It's a Boss, it's solid - and a great price. Remember, this is overdrive - not distortion. For distortion, look at other Boss pedals."
504,846,4.0,"I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I don't mean merely that it's ""very good relative to its price""; I mean that it's ""very good--period."" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price, it's an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. It's excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too."
835,573,4.0,"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads, and of course ""Born On The Bayou"".  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it."
1230,573,4.0,This tremelo pedal works nicely and it's great when you're playing through an amp without tremelo. Problem solved! The price was also very good.
1065,573,4.0,"This is a great Tremolo pedal.It is very quiet and when used correctly, there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever.You can blend the Tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged ""on/off"" type tremolo.Tremolo varies the volume of the sound. It does not vary the pitch.You have control over the ""depth"" or ""amount"" of effect, and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.A very simple, popular effect that I wouldn't want to live without in some form or another.Pretty teal green color.As with all Boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.I have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because I use a power supply.There is no on/off clicking when depressed.There is no added hiss, hum or distortion.The battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything.Simply a great effect and quality product from Boss and tends to hold its resale value well."
504,573,4.0,"This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets."
1070,573,4.0,"I own three units capable of tremolo: Boss TR-2, Line 6 MM4, and the Boss SL-20 Slicer (like a tremolo on steroids). Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo. If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.The Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: ""Rate"" of modulation, ""Depth"" of modulation (how much does the volume vary), and a ""Wave"" shape (jagged, square, or somewhere on a continuum in between). Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own (CE-5 & PH-3), the TR-2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like you're ""playing in a fishbowl"" (as another reviewer puts it).The ""Wave"" control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility, so it is a nice feature to have. Most tremolos have it, but not all. For the price, it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy. It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on ""Guerilla Radio,"" and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths ""How Soon Is Now?"" I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest, and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.Like all Boss stuff, the box is sturdy and I like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units. The color is a sort of a dull military dark green, not the most attractive thing but not bad either.The small Boss effects do not come with a power cable, so you will have to factor that into the cost. Boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter, but I don't know anyone who says this is a must. I run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine. If it didn't I would not buy Boss product period.Bottom Line:(1) Gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds, nothing crazy(2) Not a bad price (factor in a power cable)(3) Simple to operate(4) Nice casing and footswitch; drab color"
600,803,4.0,"Wanted a way to plug in my BOSS ME70 to save on batteries. Didn't want to drop the money on a BOSS PSA, so I got this one instead which does the same job, just for less money."
373,803,2.0,"Bought it for using Danelectro mini amp, so I don't need to worry about the battery.  It works perfectly as an adaptor should be, & you won't have any surprise by its performance. :)  two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp (less than $20), the adaptor is pricy ($8.50), but it still saves me $$ for the long runs."
1426,803,4.0,"I got this to power my Danelectro Honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy.  It's a power adaptor, so it isn't too exciting, but it works fine."
675,803,4.0,I use this mostly with my Honeytone mini amplifier and Reel Echo tape echo simulator. Works very well with no problems. A lot of Danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to Ac voltage outlets.
230,803,3.0,"As stated in the title, this adapter is what you need if you use your Danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries. You can now plug it into the wall! As advertised, it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so I've owned it. The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn't seem too durable, so because of this I have been very careful so it doesn't get broken. You might be able to find an off-brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the Honeytone so you won't risk ruining it."
911,803,4.0,"...is a must if you have any of the Danelectro/FAB pedals.  As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, this is the solution.  You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter (Search for Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals!  No more battery swaps, no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes..."
1355,131,4.0,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal ""open"" to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix, Classic, and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
227,131,4.0,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well, I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little ""comb"" that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me, and the Vox is very good, I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
1326,131,4.0,"I got this pedal cause is not so expensive, and I love music. I used to play in big concerts but no more but I can tell you that for the price is good who ever wants to have some fun and learn how to use a pedal."
456,131,4.0,"Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...Now that's a Fun king wah wah!!It's big, it's hard and it's heavy but when you turn it on you understand why this is the original. It sounds exactly like how i always imagined, like in all those records...This one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be!"
382,131,4.0,"Great pedal, but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods, this thing is absolutley rediculous!  It's a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder."
1024,131,4.0,In my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist. The crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as I can foresee.
623,131,4.0,"WaWa pedals come and go, and get modded and re-thunk....But I always wanted an original Cry Baby... So this was a birthday gift to myself.Not disappointed.Down the road I MAY add some of the gazillions of electronic mods available now to personalize the sound, but for the time being I'm gonna enjoy this pedal ""As-Shipped"".Very Good Buy, Great packaging, earlier-than-expected delivery - Thanks Amazon !"
565,131,3.0,"My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives, I probably should give it 5."
722,131,4.0,"Sounds like my original.  Enough said.  Great pedal and it is still built like a tank.  I do appreciate that on this version, one can use a pretty standard AC adapter. A+."
1321,131,4.0,I love this wah. It's just perfect. I really can't find any negative about it. It's just a perfect standard wah. You won't regret this purchase at all. Just put a good analog fuzz after it & you're good to go.
477,131,4.0,"Finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in 1976 finally died. A great pedal, well made!"
207,131,1.0,"If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg. Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg."
1283,131,3.0,"It is a good pedal, but it just doesn't have the sound I was looking for. It is great for playing funk music, but for us metal heads, the wah is just too weak. For metal artists, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I am going to look into getting an Ibanez Weeping Demon, or a Morley, or whatever it is Behringer is limping to the barn with these days."
762,131,2.0,"""Oh its a crybaby"", ""I have a crybaby wah"", ""You suck because you don't own a crybaby""...I'm tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn't even tell you how many strings their instrument has!  This wah pedal just doesn't cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn't been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!The eq on this pedal isn't good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.My suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.If you want a cheap child's gimic-type toy, this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?  Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere."
368,131,4.0,"the orig, still the best! do you like guitar music? chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes. it is the one. my only stand alone outside a multi effects unit"
653,131,4.0,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz, eq, or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
1038,81,4.0,I keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one. I am using this on my Martin 12-string. The spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand.
952,81,4.0,Best 12-string capo I have ever used--and that's over decades.  Works easily and flawlessly.  Very well made.  Five Stars
983,81,4.0,This is my 6th Kyser capo.  This one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 is what I needed.  I always recommend all Kyser Capos.They last forever and do not lose the strong holds.
772,81,3.0,does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come ...was not too expensive for such good quality
240,81,4.0,If you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one.  Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need.  You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one.
68,81,4.0,"This capo does exactly what it should.  It clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used.  I have 4 Kyser capos, one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand."
1010,687,4.0,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works, and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele, and it is easy to add, move, remove. With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards, and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo, Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality, this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
1302,687,4.0,"works great, stays out of the way... cant ask for much more than that. (and expect to get it) the price was half of what i was locally."
906,687,3.0,"I've only been playing ukulele for about 3 years, so I'm new to using a capo.  It seems to hold tight."
567,687,4.0,It says for a Banjo or a Mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box. It is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on/off is really easy.
918,687,4.0,"A very strong capo..too strong for bigger instruments, but works good on ukes and mandolins and banjos with not too thick of a neck.  I have several of these capos, one for each instrument."
1387,687,4.0,"Works great with my Baritone Ukulele.  Same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo.  Easily fits in my ukulele case, too."
596,687,4.0,It's a very cute little capo. It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small. But it works.
293,687,2.0,"Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin, it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin. Any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn't have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin, even though my mandolin has a fairly low action.I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style (I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12-String to a Fender American Strat without any problems), but in this case the banjo capo didn't work for what I need. Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective, although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn't seem broken, just not up to the task.From feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it, but I know that I don't have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo 'just right' to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn't start to buzz on me in the middle of a song. I went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo."
1102,687,4.0,I use this capo all the time on both instruments. A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also. I did and they love it!
917,687,4.0,"I have several types of capos, this one seems well built.  A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it.  I really don't need to change that fast so use it very little, might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off."
503,687,3.0,It's a good banjo capo.  Inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune. End of story
1250,687,4.0,"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long, long time."
801,687,4.0,"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one, it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords, when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz."
537,687,4.0,"This is such a nice bag for the price.  Nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark, capo, or whatever.  There is a handle and a shoulder strap.  Plus, it is reallly a nice looking bag, black with a little white trim in front."
1081,173,4.0,"These are the best strap locks in my opinion, good quality, easy to install and remove, secure, and they look good.  All my guitars have these locks on them and I'm very satisfied."
616,173,3.0,"In particular, I favor the Dual Design. Why? If the need arises, it's possible to use a regular strap that doesn't have the button locks installed. I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321, and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars, and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version), two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's, and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again, I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)"
1154,173,3.0,"So I bought these because being Dunlop, I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is, they scare the piss out of me. Its not a ""tighten washer and nut"" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these, I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip, peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet, and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far, just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about, strap locks shouldnt be one of those things."
1254,173,3.0,"The screws are too long for my very thin bodied Gibson SG Classic.  I can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either---the heads are all too large.I believe I used these on my Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago, and they worked perfectly.  Not on my newer SG though--at least with the new screws it comes with.Fender Start appears to take the system well--only time will tell."
170,173,3.0,"yes, if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine...i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars...but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem...i tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did not..good luck...good price welll made.."
32,173,4.0,"best strap locks ive ever used, dunlop has always had great products.easy to install and i highly recomend them to any bass player"
1008,173,4.0,Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys. When I put them on I felt confident that I wouldn't have that issue anymore. It's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab. This should be every bassist/guitarist's best friend.
13,173,4.0,"I had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified, then it worked like a charm!  Glad I got them, much less hassle tuning up for a gig."
1358,173,4.0,These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat. You may have to drill deeper holes into your guitar in order to use them. Just follow the instructions and you can easily attach and detach your strap whenever you feel like it.
1024,173,4.0,I've tried a few different straplock options and these are the best. Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good. Highly recommend.
168,173,4.0,"Great product, I've use them before and have always thought they were top quality.  They aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great!  Easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid.  Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)"
758,173,4.0,"they work well. For me, the instalition wasn't that hard, it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system, BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in, its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system, lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap, take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it."
113,173,4.0,"No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience, easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener, Full Sized Squire Acoustic, and 2 Fender Strat's."
92,173,3.0,"After receiving theDunlop Dual Design Straplok Systemalready installed on my Gibson Standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, I decided to try installing them on my Gibson Studio electric (7.23 lbs.). Noproblem. Just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.I had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. Money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. Besides safety I also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. It's a nice convenience. If you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.If you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. You've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.What I don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. Theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. That is why I chose Black for mysecond set. Helps keep the product's profile down a bit. Other than that, the product works asadvertised....NOTE: As of June 2014 I have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. Do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. After repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. Do NOT use any glue in case you need to swap out the Straploks in thefuture."
1392,173,4.0,"Very easy to install, rock solid, and in my opinion, look much better than Schaller locks.Grab a set, you wont be disappointed."
1037,173,4.0,"This product is a must.  Why?..... because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable,...and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure.  I've owned numerous Straplok systems on the various bass guitars I've owned, and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system."
12,173,4.0,"I have two sets of these for my straps.  The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings, especially if new.  The gold finish matches my instrument's hardware and they are sturdy and durable.  Works for me!"
570,173,4.0,"It's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. It sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height!"
1172,173,4.0,"Oh Yeah, Love this item, sleek looking and very easy to maintain, would definitely buy again for next strap, thank you Jim Dunlop."
492,173,4.0,"I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars.  Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on.  I have had zero issues with these.  The installation takes 2 minutes, and has stood up to countless hours of play.  Highly recommended!"
977,173,4.0,"these dunlop straploks are amazing! never had them fail on me, and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home, they stay secure when done properly, I've looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work, and work well."
278,173,4.0,Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals .  Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue / adhesive during installation.  You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar .
576,173,4.0,"i've had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven't failed me once! i love them, and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so. they rotate in full circles, and are super durable. you should buy them for all your guitars, and you'll never have to worry again. they are also very easy to use, and &#34;install&#34;."
440,173,3.0,"What's great about the Dunlop design:They work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.The design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.What doesn't work with the Schaller Design:Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."
205,173,4.0,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops, and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past, on friends' guitars, semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast, these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still, the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes, making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch, using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
14,173,3.0,I use these on my basses and they do the job quite well.. They are easy to install on the bass and the strap.
979,173,0.0,These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.
1180,173,4.0,"I've been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years.  I have not had one fail on me ever.  Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right.  I've struggled with the C clip in the past, but what are you going to do?  It's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie."
132,173,1.0,"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!"
1175,173,2.0,"The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood, if this makes sense, and I can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons, which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars, and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap, unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders, and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  I've ordered a set."
260,173,1.0,"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool."
1356,173,3.0,"I like these straplocks, but they were a little tight to get on a Levy's strap.  I did manage to get it on.  However, I found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar."
366,173,4.0,"Quick snap on and off. Sturdy.  If it is not convenient, it won't be used.  In this case, it is very convenient and easy to use, hence, your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident.  Well worth the money spent!"
520,173,2.0,"I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure.  However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon."
242,173,3.0,"The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy, fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments.  The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller's system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body.  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner ""violin"" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.  Recommended for most guitar body styles"
313,173,4.0,"Installed on two guitars and I love them! I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off. Great product, would recommend to any guitar player!"
272,173,4.0,These are great.  I have these on all my guitars.  Only problem is the clip on install to the strap.  If you can't get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place.  Once installed you are good for life.
1209,173,3.0,"I know this is a great product.  I've had a set before.  I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  The product comes in a clam shell package.  For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.The product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.  If I find a retaining clip that will work (I do have one to compare with) then I can use it.That said, I'll say again, the Straplok System is a great product.  I know, I've owned another set for more than twenty years!"
762,173,3.0,"A little story to back these lock's integrity.  I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks."
660,173,4.0,"I've been using these straplocks for over 10 years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio...they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot. Folks, this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap, even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it's not going anywhere. This is a must have, just buy it!"
1088,173,4.0,"I'm in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system, as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component, which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go, but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that, I installed this into my new guitar and strap and, I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process."
402,173,3.0,"I've been using these Fender straplocks over the last year:Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself, and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster. I've decided to try these because they use a ""dual"" system: you can use the lock on your strap, or just use your ""regular"" strap without the locking mechanism. I've only been using these for a week, but so far, I like them much better than Fender's. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you're not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap."
214,173,4.0,"I have used Dunlop Straplocks for 32 years. I bought the original style years ago for my Strat, Les Paul and Partscaster; the last two having the most weight.These things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem. I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out. It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing. I ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar.I suggest these over the other brands - watch what touring bands use. These things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch. If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it, these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure.The price is good, price them anywhere else and include shipping. I always buy strings, picks or other stuff to get free shipping."
1312,173,4.0,"Good Quality, great price, easy to install, easy to lock and unlock, fast delivery. Better than going to the always overpriced Guitar Center."
698,173,4.0,I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly. A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system.
1064,173,3.0,These are good if you have a few of guitars and got a favorite strap.  Buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts.  seems really sturdy and well made.
1342,173,4.0,"I went a long time convincing myself that I didn't need these.  I had numerous times when my strap would come undone - fortunately never during a performance.  These solved the problem.  I still check, but they just won't pull out or release."
1335,173,4.0,These guys are rock-solid and really easy to install. Any time I get a new instrument I change the stock buttons out for Dunlops!
640,173,4.0,"I have these on my Jazz Bass, my guitar player has another brand. We were playing a HUGE downtown street gig in Altanta and were throwing T shirts to the crowd. Bending down, picking them up, then throwing. My guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 Les Paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. Mine stayed locked perfectly..."
368,173,4.0,they work. its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage. ive done it  it sucked! worth every penny!
161,173,4.0,Have them on four guitars. Never a malfunction. Easy installation and use. Watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok. Might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses.
667,173,2.0,"Work very well, nice low profile, easy push button on and off but, it is true, not good for thick straps. And the Gold Tone ones discolor easy with minimal use."
1393,173,4.0,"These are really great guitar locks!! I use them on all my guitars, and I would highly recommend them to anyone!!"
915,173,4.0,These work just like you want them to.  But a new strap and put these on right away.  It's worth it.
235,173,4.0,i have purchased 5 of these strap locks. i would recommend them to all. they work good. very solid hold. thanks
944,173,4.0,Again I feel line I work for Dunlop.....I don't just love the products .all my guitars and Basses have these locks
1265,173,4.0,"I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own.  I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps, but these are great; they are all plenty tough, and if I find myself with my Straplok'd strap, it's nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch."
457,173,4.0,"Do as the manual says, lube them up every so often, and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button, and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes, and it works with most straps, as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box, it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however, as most straps are adjustable, so just adjust for the change in strap position, and you're golden!"
51,173,4.0,"My bass had original-equipment Dunlops on it, but they were silver-tone, whereas all my other hardware is gold.  And after 30 years, they looked kind of dirty and tarnished.  So, I knew it was time for a new gold set, and I couldn't be happier with their look and quality.  I have used that other S-brand on other instruments, and really prefer the Dunlops."
58,173,4.0,"About 4 years ago,  one of my friend dropped his bass and its body broke in half. that bass had regualr strap button, ever since then he use this dunlop straplok system. i recently built a bass myself and i install this one. it's very easy to install, very straight forward to use it. it holds my jazz bass without any problem. i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars."
530,173,4.0,"These are the ONLY straplocks I use, and I have them for ALL of my guitars.  They are the only ones I trust.  They are solid, secure, and they look great.  And the push button release makes them pretty convenient too, without sacrificing security.  Love 'em!!"
838,173,3.0,"Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing. I can see the merits of screw on locks, what with the ease of switching the locks, but these work fine for me."
145,173,4.0,"I hate spending 13 bucks on a couple little pieces of hardware that probably cost 13 cents to make, but its better than the 20 bucks local music shops want for this same set.  Overall they work really well and look sharp.  They fit perfectly on my Schecter Hellraiser.  Very happy with my purchase."
1421,173,2.0,"The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons.  The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes.  This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again.They do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required."
83,173,4.0,"I play guitar and keyboard and, sometimes, I need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards. I would not do that without this straplok."
446,173,4.0,"The first thing I do when I get a new instrument, is put a straplok on it before gigging with it.They're easy to install, I haven't had one fail on me yet.I have straploks on nine instruments right now, and I just ordered another for my new bass...I can't recommend them highly enough!"
1264,173,4.0,I&#8217;ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use. Very secure. The best I&#8217;ve used so far.
741,596,4.0,"Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments. A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful, and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better. Either way, stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point. These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap, and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point. I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldn't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct."
934,596,3.0,".I BOUGHT A UKULELE  TO GIVE AS A PRESENT.  I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME EQUIPPED  ON NEW MUSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF POOR QUALITY SO I PURCHASED THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A REPLACEMENT.  I'VE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS, AM FOND OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN PRODUCTS.  THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME. THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME."
94,596,4.0,"I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus."
1366,596,2.0,"Great guitar companies don't always make (or sell under their aegis) the best strings. I love my Teles but I can't stand Fender strings. Likewise, I love my Martin ukulele, but trying these strings for the second time, I had the same conclusion as I did the first; Aquila's are far better. Aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller, richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martin's (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke, put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquila's for playing. Some may like the Martins but few won't love the Aquila's."
195,157,4.0,"Works as it should. Nice materials and I think it will be durable. Simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed. It will improve your recordings, getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway."
156,157,3.0,"great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the P's, i don't know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue"
691,157,3.0,"I'm not very familiar with how pop filters actually work, apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording. I have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on. I don't know how it compares to other pop filters though, but this one seems like it works for me."
312,157,3.0,"What a difference a pop filter makes, I use on a condenser mic, it lets me get a little more gain input, clamps on easy and holds good, the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job. I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension, It has improved the vocal tracks. Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio."
239,157,3.0,"Great quality and construction. Does it's job well. Only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline. These bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy. Overall, stays in place and does it's job well. A workhorse for sure."
791,157,4.0,"For the price, this is the perfect pop filter... really good length and the clamp is decent, hope it will last me awhile..."
1013,157,3.0,"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine, the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side, the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use."
888,157,4.0,no complaints.  attaches firmly and does the job.  Can't beat it for the price.  Order this with eyes closed.  Great deal.
1099,157,3.0,It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter. What else is there to say?
418,157,4.0,"Pop filter works great. This really eliminated many subtle flaws I had with audio recording. Granted, you can make a make-shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon. But the adjustable clamp is really...well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations. Plus, although it is flexible, it is also very sturdy so don't worry about and vibration noises coming from this."
325,157,1.0,"the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done."
296,157,4.0,"This works fine, although the mount is a bit weird to me... but I see that most are the same.  As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring.  Just pop filtering through black pantyhose !! lol"
491,157,0.0,I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
417,157,3.0,"this little guy has help me record with my Apogee One voices and amps, to prevent air-flow shock on diaphragm... wanna have excellent recordings? get one!"
1266,157,0.0,"wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!"
797,157,4.0,"Wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh? Some people pay for silver and expect gold ;)Okay, so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful ""pop"" sounds that this is supposed to filter ""hard P, hard T, hard B, S, and a few others."" So I got this. Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The ""pop"" sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all, just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball, it looks like a professional product. It doesn't really matter since I work from home and not in a public place, but it's nice to know I can show it to people and it ""looks nice""3. The clamp, bendable arm, and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to, say, a desk probably won't be a stable as attached to a round thing, like the stem to a mic.4. I don't know why people think this ""isn't sturdy""...I mean you're not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that it's 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.Cons1. It's pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I can't do that anymore with this pop filter on it. Now it's become a permanent member of the front of my desk.Outside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up, I have no complaints about this pop filter. It works well, it attaches nicely, it does what it is supposed to do, it looks nice, and the quality is good. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time."
872,157,1.0,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller."
986,157,3.0,"Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good.I've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences.  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.Compared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.And yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.  Just buy one now, save yourself the trouble."
423,157,3.0,"It does what it's supposed to do. It's as well made as most, I think. They all look cheap to me, unless you get a studio professional grade. The screen pops out easily, but it will pop back in. It works well for my home recording."
255,157,4.0,"Peter Piper Picked A Pack of Purple Peppers - test passed, no &#34;puh&#34; sound to be found on the recording."
730,157,2.0,does not stay in place well.
919,157,3.0,"Though I'd warn if you don't know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de-esse the whole thing, but between the pop filter and a slightly off-center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses's from making an appearance in any way."
748,157,3.0,"works very well, keeps the popping to a bare minimum, easy to install, cleans in a flash, lightweight and works"
448,157,3.0,"I do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos, and after using this filter, the pop that occurs with P's and B's in the voice are basically gone. It makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances."
425,157,4.0,"When you record singing, you need this to prevent the pop sound. It is definitely worth it. It also makes you looks professional."
1233,157,4.0,"This pop-filter rocks. I like it a lot, does well compared to lots of other filters I tried. It's got a nice look too."
1208,157,4.0,"Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work. I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra. I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference, as expected. It makes sense that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively, but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs, and I didnt notice either effected."
406,157,4.0,"I use it with an Audio Technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording. Not much else to say."
478,157,3.0,works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made. but other than that works as intended.
1300,157,4.0,"I love this pop filter!  It is every to attactch and doesn't scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do.  The adjustable arm is very flexible, yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement."
659,157,3.0,"For the price, this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However, there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that, if I pick up the mic, the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once, but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
1012,157,4.0,Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the difference with the POP filter on right away. Good investment.
1406,157,3.0,"A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway."
571,157,4.0,"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will, drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized, it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer, allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell, even my cats can't do that, and they're porcelain."
431,157,4.0,Very sturdy and awesome pop filter. Adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter! I would recommend this to anyone!
23,157,4.0,This filter arrived very quickly! I use it with a Scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should. Good purchase.
1081,301,4.0,"These are high quality cables, both construction wise and in audio quality.  I use these shorter cables if I have to run bits of my rack to external amps/units, ie: unplugging and plugging in a lot, and I find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable.  I'm satisfied."
262,301,4.0,Good Quality cable and price. Works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables.It does not make any noise
1006,301,4.0,"Sometimes I have to run a longer cable to a snake if I'm doing the big band thing. Otherwise, I use this cable at every show. Love it."
750,301,4.0,Looks vintage but works great at a great price. As good or better than my Monster cable for a lot less money!
1076,301,3.0,"This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them. I love their flexibility, options for colors and ends, build quality and price. I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I don't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do."
463,301,4.0,got this short cord to go from amp to waa! It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine
936,301,4.0,"Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well , does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot , connectors seem to be heavy duty , time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time ."
242,301,4.0,"After suffering through crackles, lost signals, and all the rest, I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon.com.  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet, I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks, I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure, with no loss of signal, no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally, I can be confident that when I play, something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way, the old-school tweed look is a plus, too."
720,301,1.0,"Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120."
1338,301,4.0,"Spectraflex makes great cables. I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar. This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable, and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive,) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan. I recommend this cable without reservations."
641,301,4.0,"I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's.  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik, but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length).  These have worked well, quiet, no handling noise, seem well built (I treat cables well, so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week, and after 50 uses, no problems.  I recommend them (plus, for live, the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).  Nice pieces..."
848,301,3.0,"This is a pretty strong cable. I wanted something I can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case I'm sitting on the amp. the angle does the job. seams strong , seams like it will last."
1144,301,3.0,I bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that I use with my bass.  The 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non-intrusive smart looking setup.  I'm pleased.  I've owned them for a few months now.  No issues at all and they look good.
1324,301,4.0,"I'm a professional musician and love these cables, they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables I've been using"
1343,301,4.0,This has become my number one cable for my Carvin bass. I gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid. I only use something different if I need a longer reach. And I love the tweed cover. Very satisfied with this one.
888,404,4.0,Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  I'm opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the 'brit' setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this.
1194,404,4.0,"There are several types of practice amps. High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. He's not a big kid, so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously. For example, I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Don't let the size fool you. I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldn't have been more wrong.  There are several big websites and it's tough to find any negatives about this amp. Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too."
698,404,4.0,Great little amp. I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp. I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker.
1178,404,3.0,"It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.First of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and off.Next! I wish they'd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34;, &#34;overdrive&#34;, &#34;distortion&#34;, and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.Then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.None of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3."
50,404,3.0,This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features.
816,404,4.0,The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V. Now I can take it along and use it in Europe/ Asia and USA.I saved $30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240V.Happy Customer!
552,116,4.0,"A good solid piece of equipment! It sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful! The description listed slight wear marks on the back, but I had to really look hard to find it (one). It came as well packed as a brand-new guitar and looks like one!"
888,116,3.0,"Tone control didn't work so it was returned.  But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fret-board quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect.  If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups.  The sound is let's say... average.  Good beginner guitar, or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups.  The bolt-in neck didn't bother me but the SG 400 doesn't have that which is another reason I would step up next time.  Shape is ok.  Purely subjective.  I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since it's more conservative.  But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style.  Can't believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks.  Also, even though I was tempted with the faded finish, the glossy finish is really nice.  This guitar will make a player proud."
1288,116,4.0,"i love this thing!!!  action is perfect,  great sound,  good feel, easy to play i highly recomend this"
882,507,4.0,At first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my Epiphone LP-100 Les Paul Electric Guitar
475,507,4.0,Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed.
96,507,3.0,"love the case nice and simple, it really look exactly the same as the picture. highly recommend to everyone looking for a case."
965,507,4.0,"Bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter. The guitar fits in this case perfectly, and is very well protected."
528,507,4.0,I ordered this for my Epi LP Special 2 and obviously it fits like a glove! Beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle. Solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge.
818,507,4.0,"Basically, this case is very sharp looking - made with good quality materials. The inside of the one I received was grey fur. The case would probably take a beating over time, but its not a SKB case. Nice enough that I wouldn't check it at the airport. Survived a trip in a moving van from Philly to Boston.Would definitely recommended if you need a case that your Les Paul fits very snugly and safely into."
434,507,4.0,"This case it built really well, it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck, it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
1428,507,4.0,"Its a tight fitting case. I am a proud owner of aEpiphone Les Paul Custom Proand it fits as snug as can be. When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar. It arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic. I am sure I received a new case. Being perfectly  protected as it was, it hadn't a mark on it so.As far as the construction, it not a flight case by any means. It looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job, to protect the guitar. My guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit. With this said, over time there is a possibility of wear. I would predict the buckles may be the first to fail. And then handle doesn't look as durable as it could be , we'll see on that.Overall this is the case for the Epiphone Les Paul. I saw the Gibson case and I just don't see them as superior enough to justify paying more. I am satisfied with my purchase and I think most people would be. Five stars for now. I will edit in the future if necessary."
852,507,4.0,Very nice case for the price.  Solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my Epiphone LP.  Would definately recommend.
127,507,4.0,"Hello, I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty. I'm very satisfied with the quality of this case, as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected."
1379,507,4.0,"this case is the best i've ever had...very plush on the inside, and hard construction on outside is very strong...the handle extreamly soft to the touch...i guess all my other cases just don't measure up to this one...it even locks...if your guitar fits...but this for the quality!!!"
314,507,4.0,"The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories. It does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality. The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used. Otherwise great case, highly recommended."
611,507,4.0,"I use this for my Epiphone Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul. It fits perfectly in the case, one of the best cases I own and have seen, the carpet is awesome, also has a pocket in the middle, what holds the neck up, and can fit a strap and even a pedal. Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case."
694,507,4.0,"An affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly. That's all there really is to say, if you need a sturdy guitar case  for a Les Paul styled guitar and don't want to spend a butt-load of money, look no further."
285,507,4.0,I bought the bigger version of this for my Riviera P93 and this case is just as plush and protective- best deal going for a brand new case - I just wish they had these for more brands-
214,507,3.0,"I do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a LP case. I have bought a lot of stuff here on AZ so looked at this one and had it shipped to him. He says its great so that is my review.Prices are always great on AZ and Prime saves me money in shipping.4 stars is my tops, anywhere."
439,507,4.0,"I could not believe the quality of this case, fits my Epiphone Les Paul 100 like a glove.  Very plush interior, plenty of storage and very durable."
623,260,4.0,"Ordered one of these Gig Bags for a new Les Paul - the hard shell cases are back-ordered, and I didn't want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust.Fits a LP Studio perfectly, has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket. Does the Job !"
552,260,4.0,"If you're looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case, this is it. For the price, it has better padding than I expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps. Good deal for the price!"
1194,260,1.0,"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."
1303,260,4.0,"This bag is light, with two back pack straps, a pocket for accessories, excellent quality material and a good quality zipper.  If you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it."
1113,260,4.0,"This bag fits my Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar very well...but no room to spare.  The outside pocket is too small for sheet music, but works for small things like a tuner and short cable.  I prefer a bigger pocket, but aside from that I can't complain.  This gig bag looks really sharp, and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying."
402,260,3.0,"Good quality bag for my Epi LP. Fit like a glove, in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories."
134,260,2.0,"This gigbag is a very tight fit for my Epiphone Les Paul. Their is minimal padding, so it is little more than a dust cover. I tossed it aside, and bought a Fender gigbag. The Fender is heavily padded, and gives me some serious protection."
526,260,3.0,"At &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag. It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying. These are also easily removed if they bother you. This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics."
668,707,4.0,"Rugged, robust, flexible. Couldn't ask for more in a momentary switch. Like all Boss products it will probably last longer than me."
1321,707,4.0,"I got this for use with the Boss DD-20 as a tap-tempo. It does the job well, it's a little big for what it is, but definitely worth having with a delay pedal"
650,707,0.0,"I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with..."

783,707,4.0,"I could not beat the price. The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal. It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear. Also, it not to big. It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board. Very happy with this item."

741,35,4.0,"Summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing: This is more than worth the money. If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So, here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier.Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either. All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod. While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isn't much about it that would give away its price. No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt you'll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!"
1274,35,4.0,"First off; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home.I DID NOT: expect good quality, sound or comfortably from this guitar.I DID: want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.When I unboxed this guitar I was floored! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far. The strings it came with weren't complete crap, but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings. The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant.It's quite comfortable to play, I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away. I'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E' on it, so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking. I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag. GET IT!Also; I'm buying a hard case to take it home, or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection. My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after I'm gone. Even if I do decide to leave it out here; I'll be buying another one when I get home!"
591,35,3.0,"This is NOT my first guitar. Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins. It's not. Here's what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted, AMAZINGLY playable guitar. Fit, finish, feel and action were all VERY nice... Sound on the other hand? Let's face it. It's plywood all around. It SOUNDS like plywood. But that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks.It's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. It's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. Leave it in your car to practice at lunch. Leave it in the office. ANY guitar is better than no guitar... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box... New, premium strings DO make a difference.If your expectations are for a playable, rugged, affordable guitar you won't be disappointed. If sound quality is your primary concern, well... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.For my desired application, this guitar was great... I'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat."
36,35,4.0,It is my son's first guitar and he is learning on it well.  It is still in great condition. good quality Guitar!
1288,35,4.0,"this thing plays great!!  action is low but does not buzz, very easy to chord.i highly recomend this guitar."
323,35,4.0,"Well constructed with quality woods, saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight, level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell, stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever, just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna, Davidson, Main Street, or any other 'no name' - get this one."
830,133,4.0,"I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy. These picks keep a nice bright tone, very little friction on the strings - so low string noise. Enough grip to stay put in hands well too."
843,133,4.0,"I've been buying Dunlop pick for at least 15 years now, and I love the feel and the grip. The picks last for a really long time, and I would recommend getting several thickness' for different applications. But for sitting in a room playing around, with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick"
350,133,4.0,Sounds great. I own 5 different gauges. I like the gripping surface. .90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast.
1396,133,4.0,Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone.  Especially on acoustic.  These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion.  They have a long life and do brighten your tone.  Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or  carpet scrap to bring back the original shape.
296,133,3.0,"These are nice, I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well."
1156,133,3.0,The grip is excellent. But I prefer the 1.14 Sharps over these. These are sturdy and look like I won't be needing another set for quite some time
952,133,2.0,"We all have different tastes in guitar picks, I know,  As I wrote elsewhere, the Dunlop Tortex are awful for acoustic, in my opinion.  These Ultex are much better.  Not as noisy, better feel.  Still not my favorites.  I'll have them with me for spares."
980,133,1.0,I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!
1157,133,4.0,"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick, but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness, which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing, but they do wear down and fray on the edges, and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming, while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!"
1071,133,4.0,"Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I used the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks, but I gotta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great."
784,133,4.0,"I've used the Tortex picks for a while now, and have been really happy with them. This pick however, takes it to the next level. Very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick. I use the .73 for acoustic and the same holds true. Great product."
1005,483,4.0,"I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a polish. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product."
260,483,4.0,"Ive been using this polish since the early 80's. It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars. Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars. What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way. Martin knows what they're doing. I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes."
543,483,4.0,"Used it once, but once was enough. Had been using Gibson Polish, although it worked fine, just couldn't force myself to use it on my Martin Veterans Model Guitar."
295,483,3.0,This product is excellent.  Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue.  Made my little Martin look almost as good as new.
748,483,4.0,"this is the one that everyone told me I should use, being new to guitar I figured one polish (car) has to work well, that was very incorrect on my part, this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes"
1061,483,4.0,I bought this for my son to clean his guitar with. He really likes it a lot. It works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth. I would buy this product again!
1302,650,4.0,"put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well...  Love it to death, had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility.  the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough.  I could go on, but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here."
62,650,4.0,"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way, once plugged in, it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar, a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good, if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole, this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar."
1124,650,2.0,"This is not a bad product, just not great.  As soon as I received it, I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar, and played with it for over two hours.  Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit ""tinny"" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in ""passive"" mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely, Doc"
730,650,4.0,"Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.  Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy."
1298,777,4.0,What can I say? These are probably the most well-known pads available and probably the best. This was the best price I could find on Amazon and they arrived as described via very prompt shipping.
1325,777,4.0,"Ok, so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass, which previously had disappeared in my studio, is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk, but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure, they're a little pricy, but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them, and people continue to buy them, I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!"
1165,777,4.0,"These really do work great. No more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now. I do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my 5"" monitors. If anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know. Thanks!"
314,777,2.0,"I'm using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface. Unfortunately, these angle the speakers down by default, so I had to do some cutting and rearranging, but it worked out. If you need to cut these to fit your speakers, try to find something better than scissors, because it's quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them."
1385,777,4.0,These are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. I feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. And they look professional too.
395,777,4.0,"Just what I needed for my Home Studio Monitors that sit on the table next to my Computer and my DAW system, was surprised at how many different versions I was sent, they all work well thanks heaps......"
633,777,4.0,"The reviewer who wrote that that these are ""cheap foam"" worth $5.00, doesn't understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators. A/B these with some $5.00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work. I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each. These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had. It seems my speakers were ""audio coupling"" with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies.My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ. Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate. I didn't hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers. I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range. The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion. Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end, I love these speakers. Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers. He said he loved them. I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on. WOW!! What a difference. It was an immediate difference. The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there. I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix. I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers. Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately. These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem. ""Cheap foam""?? I don't think so."
1176,777,4.0,"Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors, however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life, I can assure you that, whereas they're not life or death, they do make a significant improvement on the listening process, especially in your project studio. No, they're not going to make your music sound any better, but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly, although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads, I can't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger, I would need a second pair, especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all, overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference."
1132,360,3.0,"These strings are very bright and full.  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead.  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried)."
927,360,4.0,"As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task.  While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic.  The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money.  They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them...  Granted that's only aesthetic."
1219,360,4.0,Ive been trying different strings for years!!!  Ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change.  These are very bright and clean!!!!  very playable!!!
493,360,2.0,"Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings, and these are toward the light end.  The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium.The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a ""bend"" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique."
834,665,4.0,"I bought these to put on my really old Martin acoustic. The guitar still sounds amazing, and these strings certainly fit my budget, and provide a great sound."
643,665,4.0,These are one of the best strings I've used. I'm a blues guitarist so they take a beating well. Very much worth the cost and I thank Amazon for having them!
808,665,4.0,"These are good strings, for a good price.  I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time."
522,665,4.0,"These strings retain a good feeling for a long time, well past the point of them needing changed because they've lost brightness."
708,665,4.0,"I used to use Elixir Nano string, and a good as they sound, they do not last. These do. great sounding strings."
457,665,3.0,"These strings are great sounding, and great looking on the fretboard, because they are bronze. One issue I had, was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head, but it still wound up very nicely. I would actually say that you might want to get the Extra Light gauge, but it's probably just my tuning machines, they kind of suck."
226,378,4.0,These are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion. They play extremely well and last a Long time. There's nothing better than these strings.
643,378,4.0,I have a 1993 Taylor which is in mint condition. I always use Martin on any acoustic. I bought the Taylor about 6 months ago and have found that the Medium Martin Strings are best for this particular guitar ... every acoustic is different though.
393,378,4.0,"Fast shipping, great price and most of all great stings, very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend."
1225,378,0.0,"Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string."
1061,378,4.0,These were purchased for my sons guitar. He loves them. I plan on buying him another set of them for Christmas.
1196,378,4.0,"The Martin MSP4200 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Medium  are very good strings that are just below strings like Elixer's except they are much much less expensive."
1233,378,4.0,"With a nice clean, crisp sound, inexpensive price, and durable history, I've made these strings apart of my acoustic set. I've got at least 6 spares at home right now. XD"
11,378,3.0,I am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings.  They have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly.
784,378,4.0,I've used these strings for quite a while now. They have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity. If you're looking for a good string that last a fair amount of time before dead string syndrome hits... I'd recommend these.
45,776,4.0,These are nice and sturdy picks.They sound real clean.I'm having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings.I still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics.
1254,776,4.0,"I used to swear by Hard and stiff picks on my Les Paul Custom, but I recently bought a Strat '62 re-issue--and these are TOO MUCCH FUN for fast rhythms with a WAH or Phase 90 (phaser) pedals!!!"
954,776,4.0,"Just the perfect pick I was looking for, I've tried experimenting with several types of picks. Finally found the right one!"
373,776,3.0,"I have tried few picks, textured, mallow color, and this bright green.  I like it bright color that is very easy to found, and 0.88mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar."
388,776,4.0,"They work as well as any Dunlop pick; they don't crack, which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety.  I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks, because they get flimsy after a while.  Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store."
843,776,4.0,"I've used everything you can think of in the way of picks and the Tortex are one of my favorites. I have at least 100 of them in various thickness' and these and the Claytons, are all I need. The Claytons are great too, but there are times that I want a different thichness and with the Tortex and Claytons you can find the perfect pick for anything you want to play. They last forever and have a great grip.You gotta try them out"
1015,776,4.0,"I bought the .73 mm picks & I would consider them medium thickness. If you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness. The .73 mm is right for me, I really like them."
1024,776,4.0,Love these picks. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend.
41,776,4.0,"I've always used Planet Waves nails but I wanted to try the Dunlop buying me this little package. A very good experience. Durable, comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily."
565,776,4.0,"I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect. I hit the strings very, very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I don't break many strings."
664,776,4.0,"I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at ""Cactus Picks"" to get an idea of what I mean."
471,776,4.0,I like the picks a lot! They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! Recommended
927,776,4.0,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop, the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway, I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack, don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise, I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
862,776,4.0,"Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option. It lasts long, sounds great, and feels very nice. It is probably the most favored pick among all companies. I recommend the orange one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want. Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price."
977,776,4.0,"I've always used these dunlop picks, I've tried other ones like fender, other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right, I've never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing, give them a try! ... if not you'll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead"
952,776,1.0,"I've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these Tortex picks are nearly the worst I'v ever used.  They are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise.  Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better."
576,776,4.0,"thankfully i still have most of these picks. i'm always losing them, but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on."
1180,776,4.0,"I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great.  Between these blues and the yellow, I'm covered."
132,776,4.0,"If you don't know what type of pick you like, buy a sample pack. Picks make a big difference to sound and playability. These are thin and flexible. Easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general. However the tone is different. So you'll need to decide what songs they work for, etc.As far as quality, these are great. Easy to grip, and as durable as most."
75,776,3.0,"Good picks, great feel and brings out sound loudly. Mostly for Electrics. I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric, Fender."
136,776,4.0,"I used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from Paul Gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of 1mm. These things are great and yes, I can shred faster now!"
1226,776,4.0,"Finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because I don't like them too thin or too thick, this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for. The logo will wear out in a few uses but I don't much about that. Been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it's not wearing out too fast. Recommended!"
875,776,4.0,I think these are great for the price they give you. John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these.
1263,776,4.0,I've used these picks for years with great results. If you've never used this stile picks you won't be sorry.
573,776,4.0,"In a fit of boredom or curiosity, I decided that I would check out some the other picks out there.  After spending too much money for various brands of picks, including every model of the DAVA picks, I came back home to Dunlop Tortex green.  They stil play great, sound great against steel strings, and last a long time."
151,776,4.0,"These will pluck Guitar and Bass strings decently. If you want one set to cover both applications, this is a good choice."
1375,776,4.0,Tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner
178,776,4.0,i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! either way the picks are great although i would suggest the Jazz picks over these
438,776,4.0,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example, I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em, use them daily, and rely on them !!!"
238,776,4.0,"I love the Tortex .50mm picks (red).  I have one that's over 4 years old and still going strong!  Yes, the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off, but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings.  I use the red, yellow, and orange Tortex's exclusively for practice and performance (I'm a church worship leader).  My highest recommendation."
938,776,4.0,"I love these picks for playing my acoustic. They give such a nice, crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic. For me I prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric, probably a .70 or .80 but I still like the tortex picks for that as well. And these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply."
609,776,4.0,I don't seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip....
384,776,4.0,my favorite picks. Can't go wrong with tortex. the only habit I have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so I have to buy like a ton of them
58,776,4.0,i've used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one. i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect. very easy to grip and last long. one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind. highly recommand this for anyone needs pick!
1275,776,4.0,"These are such comfortable picks... I love the texture on them, which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks' textures. This is subtle yet effective. My favorite pick now."
149,776,4.0,"Great picks, buy it. This pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing."
713,776,3.0,"I have always used tortex picks. I like them a lot and they last forever (almost :)these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though, these are rockin."
446,776,3.0,"This is the pick I learned to play with.Great feel, doesn't slip in sweaty fingers.Good tone, you can get plenty of use from one pick, as they hold up very well!"
227,793,4.0,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less ""clicky"" - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same, I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point, so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop, they sound and feel just right to me, and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
1287,793,3.0,"Ever since I started playing the guitar, I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with, but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them, as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
1005,793,4.0,"I like thin picks myself, and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time, but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off, it is ideal. Also, if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar, it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy, but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most, it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!"
28,793,3.0,I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider. I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me.
952,793,3.0,"I would give these picks five stars, but I do have a couple of other types I prefer more.  Still, these are nice picks.  So far I've only used them on 12-string guitar, but I'll soon be trying them out on 6-string guitars."
1086,793,4.0,"They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance, so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone, but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking, since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin, flexible picks), and Amazon has the best price."
939,793,2.0,"These just don't have the right feel and the sound isn't that great compared to other materials.The quality control is so so. The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them.I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip .96mm or PRS 1.0 picks. For more flexibility or acoustic, I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks."
414,793,4.0,"yes, i think you should try these.  if you're looking at them, then get them.  they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w/o any pick experience.  i don't drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w/o looking."
603,793,4.0,"These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. They grip very well, and last forever, and they're a tiny bit more muted than other, more &#34;plasticky&#34; picks."
605,793,4.0,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
777,793,4.0,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i dont see how you can go wrong."
490,793,4.0,"These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size, not to big or too small.  Been using these for years.  Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases.  They never wear out.  They are not too stiff or too flimsy.  They work good for the sound on the strings.  Easy to hold on to."
228,793,3.0,"I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musician's Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack. I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought, so I went on the hunt for very thin picks. The celluloid one fell apart quickly, so I wanted a better material.These white nylon picks should last a lot longer. The non-pointed end is all grippy (textured), so it doesn't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick, but it does the job and I like it. The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely, but you can still pick with it if you're combining picking and strumming.I'll keep using thicker picks for picking-only songs and for louder strumming, but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house, these are great.UPDATE: I've been using them for more than a year now, and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly-strumming song... but you can do it. This is still my favorite pick for strumming. Hope this helps."
232,793,4.0,"OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
811,793,3.0,"These picks are nylon, so each one will last you a couple of years (as long as you don't lose them!!) this is thicker than the .60mm, so you can dig into the strings a little better, but still a hair flimsier than the Snarling Dogs .73mm picks (I know, they're the same size, but trust me these are &#34;flimsier&#34;), and the grip is ok. You can't go wrong here."
502,793,4.0,"alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online, and let me tell you, these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks, would recommend to anyone."
558,793,4.0,"I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard,  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)"
1421,793,3.0,This nylon pick has great play feel.  It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords.
1108,793,4.0,"i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them, normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing,get these."
97,602,4.0,"These picks are nice and thin, just what I was looking for in a pick.  They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down.  I'm satisfied with these picks."
206,602,4.0,"This picks are comfortable, nice quality. They'll get dirty as they are cream (or white as I see) but worth it!! Wanna play fast? take these n try em out"
414,602,4.0,"i purchased the .38mm and these (.46mm).  after using the .38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these.  i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area.  not too much, but at least something."
1025,602,4.0,"Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors. These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you're trying to play quietly. If you prefer a flexible, softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick."
235,602,3.0,ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s. they have never let me down. very comfortable in the hand.
766,831,4.0,"the are last forever! much better than plastic ones, especially if you stay in the light thickens.  TH ANK you!"
666,831,4.0,"The .6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks. And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing. I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten. And the price is right, too!"
1005,831,4.0,"I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the ""grippy"" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up!"
243,831,4.0,"Perfect fit for me. I don't like a pick that is to stiff, and I like the grip. My hands sweat a lot so I really need the grip."
522,831,4.0,Durable and affordable. The .60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick.
38,831,3.0,"I'm an Irish-style DADGAD guitarist.  These picks cut through the string really nicely, and are great for driving rhythms.  I'm starting to lean towards the Tortex .5mm, though -- I think the roughness on the surface of the Dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that I don't like.  Still, great picks."
605,831,4.0,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
1271,831,2.0,"Pretty flexible due to the 0.60mm thickness, I would recommend the Dunlop Max Grip picks over these picks.  The Max Grips have a much better grip.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
147,831,4.0,I like a flexible pick and these at .60mm work just fine.  They are also in a good color so they don't stand out too much.
58,831,4.0,"i'm a beginner on play guitar and most time i play strumming in church praise team. when i play faster songs, thick gauge picks are very easy to lose. so i like to play with thin gauge picks. i have used the 0.46mm (white)one and i want to make the guitar sound more brighter. i pick this gray one and i played last friday and sunday worship, it made sound that i desired and it wouldn't fly away from my hand while i was plying fast praise songs."
558,831,4.0,"As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree, we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks.  I am no exception.  Dozens and dozens of makers, styles, shapes, gages,  materials,  price ranges, (oh ya, the 30 dollar picks), you name it, I've tried it (even nail picking on metal strings).  Now if you are new to the &#34;perfect pick quest&#34;, you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent, with personal grip, sound interaction, a host of music ingredients making your Grail different.  However, if you play a light metal-string acoustic (my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar), check out these Dunlops .60 Nylons.Even within the Dunlop line, I have tried the different grips and thickness gages, and after all said and done, these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice.  Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb, light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings, just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing.  Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same .60 gage didn't acoustically perform quite the same.Would I try another pick if the chance was presented?  Sure, most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends,  but until then, Dunlop's .60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection."
827,831,4.0,These just happen to be my favorite.I always keep .46mm .60mm and .73mm sizes on hand. (mostly use the .60's) I've been using them for years and so will probably never change. I like the 'grippiness' of them .... I hate smooth picks.Picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like.
227,890,3.0,"I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try.  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy ""cat's tongue"" surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit, but they're not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1."
86,890,4.0,"I've been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks.  Purple ones with the turtle/500 on them.  I thought I had found my pick.  Because they were so slippery, I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip (I'd rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone).  At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0.  Yes they do offer a better grip (I think they're still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500).  But since I solved that problem with the honing stone, I was more curious.  So - again, they are better, grip wise, but I was very surprised at the difference in tone.  They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since I'm using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall.  500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter.  I don't know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound. I'm not sure how they'd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones."
350,890,4.0,"Smooth sound and attack. Grips soft, loose, and yet well. I own HUNDREDS of picks. These are some of my favorites."
570,890,4.0,"I've been playing for more than 30 years. There are a lot of great products out there and I've tried a lot of them. I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels, Fender 351 X-heavies, and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks. This is just my opinion, but I hope you'll check them out because I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
296,890,4.0,"It's a pick... everyone has their preference, but I happen to like the 1.14's a lot and the &#34;powder-y&#34; grip on these is a real bonus.  It take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are &#34;clean&#34; as well."
263,890,4.0,You can't go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick.  They have a better grip and a more full sound (to my ears) over the Tortex picks.  I have since went to the Jazz picks but these picks are a solid product.
939,890,3.0,This pick is great for strumming. Some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard. If you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip.
1079,890,2.0,Since they were named &#34;Gator Grip&#34; I expected them to have a good gripping surface.  That was not the case.  The entire material and holding surface is the same material.  Also they weren't as large as I expected.  They are still usable as decent picks.
832,890,3.0,"These have been my favorite pick for years now but, I must say that they are not real pointy and I have recently been trying some pointier pick and I'm now on the fence..."
824,890,2.0,"I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick.  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes.  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO.  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully."
1362,890,3.0,"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip, the right string resonance for strumming, and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely, strum more softly, and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal."
353,718,4.0,"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick, but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This, of course, can be very annoying, especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto, great for leads, and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
412,718,2.0,"So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get.  These picks are translucent purple.  Other than the strange color, they are good picks.  They really do help with speed and accuracy.  Great for mandolin playing.Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get."
86,718,3.0,"I always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  Some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  Some say that the grip is good.  Here's my take -- for what it's worth.  I've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  It's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  Also note, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  I've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what I've found so far.  I find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars I'm currently playing.  The process of finding the ""right"" pick is never ending and changes over time.  Give these a try and let me know what you think."
904,718,2.0,"Looking for picks for bass , this one did not work for me, it is thick and hard, good attack.but only thumb picks work, so i can use my fingers too."
360,718,2.0,"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play."
952,718,4.0,"I admit I'm not the guitar flatpicker some of my friends are, but I find this pick to be perfect for picking mandolin.  The picks have almost zero flex to them, meaning the player has solid control.  I like 'em--even if they are purple."
1283,718,4.0,"When I first got them, I thought that they were going to be cheap, as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging, but it was ok, I wasn't expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe, me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent, and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint, is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry, Amazon, but that is just to good a deal to pass on..."
893,718,4.0,I have them in purple which makes them stick out.  They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin.  Already planning on purchasing more.
1309,718,3.0,"These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more."
597,718,4.0,"Currently my favorite pick, it's thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle. I'd recommend to guitarists for jazz, fusion or the like."
16,718,4.0,"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come."
1375,718,0.0,another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.
785,718,2.0,"The right pick is a personal preference. Nothing wrong with Dunlop Stubby Pick, but it's not for me. I bought a pack of 2.0mm  picks last year and loved them but left them in Florida when I went north. I forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake."
1403,718,3.0,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy, sharp almost. After playing a bit, the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually, it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice, you won't care."
215,718,4.0,"How a guitar pick ""feels"", is such a matter of individual preference, that there really doesn't seem to be much point in trying to rate them, as what I like about a particular type of pick, may not be relevant to another player.  Most picks have high ratings, because players who like that particular type, write reviews that rate them highly.  Obviously, the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar, but that isn't always possible.  With that said, for what they are worth, here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop's purple colored, Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like a pick with a sharp point for better control, and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the pick's rounded edges, help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings, which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar, I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic, and semi-solid body guitars, where the string tension is greater.I had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously, but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker, and heavier, and has absolutely no ""give"" at all.  I'm still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers, when picking rapidly, I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry, does help.My favorite pick had been theDunlop 0.6mm nylon pick, but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily, and be more precise, while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell, but this may become my new favorite pick.The ""pick pack"" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you're a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try."
838,718,4.0,"Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster, no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain. You pay twice as much in a store."
954,888,4.0,"I use different kinds of picks, this one is very special, the strings rings out really pleasant, and great for speed picking too!"
1350,888,4.0,"As a beginner guitarist, a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks, partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully, that makes sense).  However, when I was handed one of these, it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say, now that I have my own guitar, I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
590,888,4.0,"I've been playing guitar my entire life. And I've tried almost every pick there is. After hearing how great it is, I decided to buy it. It felt really small at first, and i kinda was dissapointed. I put it down, and didn't use it for quite some time. For some reason i decided to pick it back up, and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it, i got accustomed to its size, and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I can't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. That's like the only downside I can think of. There are many dif versions of this style, so buy em all, and try em out. If these don't work for you, you can always buy the V-pick."
682,888,3.0,"Real nice Guitar Picks. It came in a 6 piece pack, they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time."
122,888,4.0,it's kinda small for my hand but it works great! it's more easier to pick the string. This pack comes with 6 picks.
1166,888,4.0,"I've been using only these even since trying them, wonderful picks for speed and precision, you won't go back for sure."
1059,888,1.0,"I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked.  They don't play at all like what I was expecting.  Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  What's up with that?I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop.  Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke."
220,888,4.0,"just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small, and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree. :D"
446,888,4.0,"Give these picks three days and you'llNever go back to another style.Almost impossible to slip out of your fingers, great tone, amazing clarity, effortless harmonics, durable and fast.This pick literally makes you play better!"
34,816,4.0,"Nice tone, very easy to grip, last me a long time. One of my favorite picks I've tried for electric. Don't enjoy them as much on acoustic."
750,816,4.0,I love these little guys. The small size forces me to hold it so just the very tips is exposed. They have a nice textured grip. I bought the red ones this time so I can see them when I drop them!
70,816,4.0,I used to use Fender medium picks only. Now for Jazz and metal I use this pick. You will just have to try it for yourself to see if it is right for you.
142,816,3.0,I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III.  And now my personal debate continues...  I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is.  I like tortex and this isn't but...I really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it.  I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times.They make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness.  I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips.This is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick.  Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn't such a bad idea after all.
293,816,4.0,"I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person, but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked. I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it."
398,816,4.0,"Been using these for longer than a decade, and met many people who prefer minimal picks , and jazz III among them. This is the closest to playing with bare hand that I can get."
921,816,4.0,I bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well.  I like the thickness of this pick.  Easy to hang onto when strumming.  Love the tone I can obtain too.
220,816,4.0,"the title says it all. it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks. also since these picks are smaller, i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks, so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out."
227,815,2.0,"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The ""gel"" in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK, the colors are bright, but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks, which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less ""clicky"" on the strings.  These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them, but they're just normal plastic picks, nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors."
570,815,3.0,"I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably. In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store. My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman ""Dawgs"". The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone. I would recommend these to anyone."
1293,815,2.0,"I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I gotta branch out man.  Not sure about these picks yet.  The feel a little more stiff my usual.  I want them to last longer.  What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round?"
1332,815,2.0,"I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different ""gel"" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well."
1196,815,3.0,They play well and hold up well(never had one break) They are my second favorite pick. But this pick is better in some songs than my favorite.
1324,815,2.0,"I actually forgot that I bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick.  It's not a bad pick, I will continue to use them but I wish they had a softer center, or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers."
1276,37,3.0,For keeping your guitar picks where you can quickly grab them the Dunlop mic stand pick holder is EXTREMELY efficient and useful ESPECIALLY when performing live.Always great products and always dependable.I also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo.Not one product has let me down yet.My capo is 8 years old.
316,37,4.0,"As I mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. Enough said. It does its job and does it ok for my taste."
903,37,4.0,I love these pick holders.  They're easy to get on and off.  They hold a nice amount of picks.  And you get that rock-star feel (throw picks at the audience).  A must for any gigging guitarist.
1411,37,4.0,Holds my picks in place  nicely... snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly...  Never come up short again...  Its just a nice accessory to have and cheap too
41,37,4.0,I have the small version. But for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more. I used in all my concerts and its excellent! 100% recommended!
1134,37,4.0,"Fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks. It is quite tight on my picks, but I imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used."
1172,37,4.0,"I bought this thing not thinking I would use it too much, but wanted it for future use, I was wrong, no more misplacing picks for me. Highly recommended, also fits on my guitar stand, very cool."
394,37,4.0,I tend to drop picks from time to time and it's nice to have them at the ready when the time arises.This was a basket filler when I needed to get to $25 for my free shipping one day but I find it very useful and use it every time I play.Don't know why I waited so long to get one..
1390,37,4.0,Works really well! This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something. You can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready.
194,37,4.0,This pick holder is awesome. It just snaps on to your mic stand...add 6 picks and start rockin'! It holds the picks securely so if you're performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away.
1343,37,3.0,"I put it on the boom of my mic stand. Tight on some, not on others. I need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place."
358,818,3.0,"Excellent product, simple and practical design,holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone.If humidity levels in your area go below 40% you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks."
115,818,4.0,"Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting. Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings. Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp. Couldn't be any easier. I use them all winter long in my guitars."
62,818,2.0,"It's nothing special.  No frills, just a simple concept that works.  It's important to maintain humidity in your instrument, especially in a dry climate like west Texas.  The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.So, when you first start using it, you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist."
666,818,4.0,"This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe.  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge."
137,818,4.0,"Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However, I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity, but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar, but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose, but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it."
532,818,2.0,"I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms."
1065,818,3.0,"I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most.Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!"
1277,818,2.0,I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick. My guitar would probably not be happy without it.
1060,818,4.0,"This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it. This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container, would say it gets more humidity out."
793,818,1.0,"It's simple, basic, but I don't think it does that good of a job. This is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extend very far into the guitar."
1407,818,2.0,A simple system for gettting humidity into the guitar; The price is just right and it is very simple to use.
646,818,3.0,"This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole.  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly."
928,818,4.0,Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars. Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water. Luckily I keep that on hand!
1120,818,4.0,I bought this guitar humidifier for my Taylor.I received exactly what I purchased and works as it should.This product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me.It is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings.Easy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic container.Price is good.
597,818,4.0,I have one of these in every one of my cases. It's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it; nothing special but it does the job.
228,818,2.0,"We all know it's just a container with a sponge in it, no biggie. I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time. Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings. But it should do the job."
551,818,3.0,it does what it says it does.  only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week.
1382,818,3.0,I agree with the others reviews.  The sponge is too small and too thin but the humidify is small so it wouldn't fit any larger sponges.  Okay for the price.
1276,302,4.0,Cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster.This is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way.It is VERY safe for guitar finishes.
691,302,3.0,"That cloth... They should have included something that doesn't fall apart.Otherwise it's great. I use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned, but I'm with other people here who commented that you can't really tell how much of the stuff is left inside. Good idea to keep more than one of these around."
15,302,4.0,"I play 5-string bass, both electric and acoustic and love this stuff.  Each bass I have has different strings for various reasons and I use this on every one.  My wife uses on her 6-string acoustic and electric guitars.  We keep a can in every case!"
271,302,4.0,"No spill, no mess. This is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks. Just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag. It will not dry out, and lasts for years. The only thing I don't like is the can will not fit in accessory area of my guitar case and the led has sharp edges, so put it down before using the cleaner."
409,302,4.0,"Fast Fret, or at least some kind of string cleaner is a 'must have' for anyone who plays guitar. Because, if you think about it, strings get really dirty over time, and this product solves that issue. :)"
758,302,3.0,This stuff will lube up your strings pretty well! The only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use- but it comes with a little cloth that I assume is meant for this little inconvenience.
590,302,4.0,"There's not much to say about this product, except that it works. It makes my strings last longer. Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars, and 20 minutes per &#34;well done&#34; restring adds up. This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible. It's small and conveniently stored too. I recommend trying it out!"
62,302,4.0,I have used Fast Fret for a number of years and think it's a great product.  It now comes in a metal can and has a cap over the applicator versus the old plastic can with no cap over the applicator.  This is a much better way to package the product and will probably help it retain the lubricant longer.
1000,302,4.0,I really love this. Tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product. Recommended.
360,302,3.0,"I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldn't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well.  I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here.  I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory, one cannot complain too much.  Now that mine has just run dry I'm going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that I've just discovered called ""The Swipe"" which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals.  If this works as well as advertised, I may still get Fast-Fret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortable.Recommended!"
886,302,4.0,"The name says it all. FAST fret = FAST fingers!  I played over 40 live shows from 45 min sets to 2.5 hr sets just this year on national stages.  My strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat, grime, and dirt flying through the air. This stuff honestly works very well.  It is part of my regular arsenal."
514,302,4.0,"I just got this yesterday so I don't know how long it will prolong the string's life but I have noticed a difference already. It's a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone. Also, it's cheap so I would give it a shot if I were you. I'm really happy that I ""discovered"" this product, in fact, I'm already ordering 2 more."
979,302,4.0,This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge); then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.
1262,302,4.0,"I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff, I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards, I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two, there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think, I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!"
292,302,4.0,Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck.
637,302,4.0,"This product is great, I use it after every session. Keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board. Every guitar player should keep this in their case."
814,302,4.0,Not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings. Hope that helps thank you
634,302,4.0,"This makes sliding on the bass real smooth. It's also nice for cleaning. It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time. And it's super easy to apply. Even though you're not a pro, act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play."
424,302,0.0,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
1004,302,4.0,"Seems to work well, though I don't know how long it's supposed to last. I have sweaty hands, and when I'm done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy."
1201,302,4.0,"I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning, the strings (especially the lower wound strings) hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning, and this problem is greatly reduced."
763,302,2.0,"I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards (well duh!)  Does it work?  Yes and no.  First it did not appear that anything was coming out.  After a bit of rubbing I did notice a &#34;slight&#34; bit of solution (turns out its mineral oil)on the fretboard by the frets.  I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless (a paper towel would hold up better- seriously!)  I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar.  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session).  I do still use this occasionally, but I would not spend money to purchase it again.  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner."
1121,302,2.0,"I used this on a 5string bass. I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.It does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers."
1280,302,4.0,"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked, especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem, at least for me, is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides, bends, and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers, but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also, I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps, but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that."
705,624,4.0,The best buy for your bass drum
21,624,4.0,This has saved my bass drum head from many holes. Also has no affect on sound of bass drum.Would recommend.
159,624,4.0,The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great.. It will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty..  I cheap buy and it works excellent..
828,624,3.0,In writing a simple review for such a simple product there's only a few concerns you should have. 1. Would the adhesive dry out on this and 2. does it wear over time? The answer is it gets 4 stars. It doesn't dry out but I had to replace mine after 5 years because it eventually wore out. That's pretty good! Not perfect but pretty god!
1087,624,4.0,"They add depth to your bass drum by muffling the overtones a bit, and it is the pads that wear out rather than your bass drum head so these actually save you money and sound better. I've used a couple different brands, and they pretty much are similar."
960,624,4.0,"they look slick and work really good, i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so"
1214,624,4.0,"its a patch that goes over the spot where your beater beats on the bass drum, guess it provides some useful purpose like kicking thru a bass drum skin, came with a few which is nice, price was right, so why not...go for it!!!"
1048,624,3.0,"I think this patch looks cool on the bass . I don't really hear any difference in sound ,But does give your drum head a better life span"
796,346,4.0,This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it don't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage
276,346,4.0,"Good stitching, no slippage. Awesome strap. Fits straps locks just fine. Perfectly happy with this strap. Thank you earnie ball!"
226,346,4.0,I needed a new strap but I didn't want to pay $20 for one. I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The strap is awesome. It's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I've ever had. It totally deserves 5 stars!
1072,346,4.0,A very good strap.
32,346,4.0,perfect size for us big guys. i do recommend some snap locks for it though. . . . . .
1350,346,4.0,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on, so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose, and notably, I chose it for the color, just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far, it's given me no problems, and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain, too, since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
1279,346,4.0,A nice simple adjustable strap that has well reinforced ends to hold the attachment posts on my guitar without any worries.  It is a bit slippery so for top-heavy guitars like Les Pauls the neck tends to keep slipping down so you have to support it with your fret hand a little.  I thinking of sewing a silicon mat on the underside so it will stay put on my shoulder.
657,346,3.0,"It's comfortable. It's adjustable. The color was a good match for the guitar. Unless you regularly gig for hours at a time, why spend 50+ smackers on a strap when this one does just fine? Put the dough into the guitar, not the strap. By several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time."
224,346,4.0,"For the money, this strap is as good as any other poly strap.  Plus, it was made in the U.S.A.!"
1131,346,3.0,"I've only used it a few times but this strap looks like it's here to last. No frills, just a plain black strap."
492,346,4.0,"This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap.  The great thing about it is the length.  As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating.  This strap is very long, if you need it to be.  For the price, very hard to beat this.  Works well withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Blacktoo.  Overall, a good buy, for a backup strap or your primary."
576,346,4.0,"i've had this strap for at least a year now, and it still works so well. goes great with my guitar too!"
1133,346,4.0,"For at great price, this strap does all that it is suppose to do.  It is very will made, has the Ernie Ball logo on it and  works just fine."
793,346,3.0,"What you see is what you get. It's cheap, It's basic, and It works. The best thing about this synthetic product is the price, and color options!"
77,346,4.0,"Made of quality material. I do not need anything fancy,because I am a simle person! It does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar!"
650,346,4.0,"Great inexpensive strap.  Really, what more can you say?  I wanted something to hold my guitar up, and it does just that."
75,346,4.0,A very attractive and well constructed strap. I've been somewhat disappointed with some of the more expensive straps but this one is Excellent...................AND NOT SO EXPENSIVE. All the Buttons fit well (Snug) and it adjusts easily and quickly.
463,346,4.0,"this is a great strap. nice tight fit, snug and secure and very flexible. Best part this strap gets long long long. Yep here it is."
298,346,3.0,"I like purple, and it is purple. The strap is sturdy. It works, what else needs to be said; it arrived timely, is decent quality, and a nice color."
155,346,4.0,this makes the second one of this straps that I have ordered and I love them. They are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself. I don't have not one bad thing to say. great buy and will do it again if I ever need anouther strap.
1377,346,4.0,So sexy with my SG. Great quality. I was going to get a pink furry one... this is better I think.
724,346,3.0,"Got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar.  This is a great strap for the money.  They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast.  If you want to spend more money, you can and get a little better (leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones -- nicer) but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value."
346,346,4.0,This is a very nice guitar strap in light gray.  The strap material and the double-leather ends are heavy duty and should last a long time.  I got this at an awesome price too!
331,346,4.0,"Product does what you would think. I use it on my bass and haven't had a problem with it yet. If you are constantly playing shows, this may not be your first choice, but if you just need something to hold your guitar or bass up, then this is it. You can't beat the price."
621,346,4.0,"I have both black and white Ernie ball straps, really comfortable, easy to adjust, holds guitar securely, and both colors look great with black guitars!"
44,346,2.0,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage, it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
147,346,4.0,"Finally I found a long strap for my new guitar.  I had bought one earlier that was leather, but was way too short.  It felt like my guitar hung around my neck.  This new strap is plenty long enough, and looks good.  My only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most players will feel it on their neck, but it sure fits nice and long.  I would recommend this to any guitar player."
1045,346,2.0,"the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily .. just try and leave it on always..its cheap but it wont fail, wont drop your guitar, if you're careful."
1351,346,3.0,"I'm sure glad that I bought these straps, there not leather but are put together very well. I plan on using them as backups in the studio. The price was just right, cam quickly and I'd buy them again."
457,346,4.0,"I've tried leather straps, I've tried Rocksteady straps, I still keep coming back to this strap. It's steady, Highly adjustable. And it works very nicely with the Dunlop Dual Design Straplok system. Good job Ernie Ball! I even prefer this to a nice Levy's strap that I own because the Ernie Ball strap is a bit slipperier"
548,346,3.0,"So perhaps I don't know what shade burgandy really is. Or the picture is a bit misleading. It is as stated, although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven. As too ""DEE""s reveiw... the buckle doesn't seem to bother me. I am not calling him or her out or anything. My best guess, it's playing style. I myself play bass, when I first started I played on the 3"" inch straps and found they bothered me, went to the 2"" straps proplem solved. I am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother. But for me and the way I play... No complaints."
897,346,4.0,"This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten, and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them. These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely, the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds), and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall. Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future."
510,629,1.0,"Not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do.  Limited dynamic range.  But, it works.  Wish I'd have gotten something a little nicer though."
482,629,4.0,This mic is great! I have one I have used from coast to coast to coast to coast. Unbeatable in price and quality. You can't go wrong with a brand name like shure. I have had mine for 14 years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box. You will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal. As a veteran bluseman I recommend it. It rocks! As clean as a marsh 'possum.
330,629,3.0,I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ON/OFF toggle on the microphone and - for us - it works great. These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room. They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day. They are still going strong.
457,629,4.0,"This microphone is the best microphone I have ever owned. It is very dense, a little quiet, but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality. It is very clear sounding, and very well built. Get this mic. You will not regret it."
1238,629,3.0,"I like the durability of it, and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be, but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
847,712,4.0,"Holy guacamole, you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase, then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
140,712,4.0,"First, I have to say the only reason I bought this is that we have two pot belly pigs that live in our house...so this was a no-brainer to purchase just to have as a fan of pigs, and I play the guitar too.Now for the review.This little &#34;collector&#34; amp turns out to be something I will actually use rather than put on a shelf to look at with all of our other pig stuff.I was very surprised how well built it is.  It's solid as a rock with chrome handles, edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control.It looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review, the AC adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally.  It also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer.  Now I can take the Fender or Gibson electrics rather than the acoustic.Okay, I keep getting off topic here...The sound is clear and crisp for it's size.  Sure, it's not my Fender Mustang IV, but I didn't pay 600 bucks for it either.  But then my Fender doesn't have a pig's snout!!  There are no controls on this for tone adjustments, just a volume knob.  But, most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway.  I would compare the sound coming from it as above average but it's the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction, for me anyway.As for it's size, I would say it's just about the size of your average small jewelry box.  But it's much heavier, deceptively heavy but I like that.  It doesn't have that &#34;cheap&#34; feel about it.Like I said, I WILL use this occasionally, especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van.  I look forward to the comments the amp will get, I'm sure way more than my guitar playing skills as I still have a lot to learn.  But, learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun.In summary, I would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone who's looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an AC adapter.A word to best describe it....&#34;COOL&#34;."
1062,712,4.0,"I have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what I want it to!  It is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet.  Turn in half way up, you get a clean sound...crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous.  I own a piece of the legend and music history!"
472,712,4.0,"Put away your effects pedals, modellers, and software for awhile and get back to the earth - or at least the simple appreciation of what an electric guitar sound can be, straight off the axe with nothing but pickups, volume, and tone pots to shape it.For me the classic Pignose-and-a-Strat sound is the opening of ""I Looked Away"" from Layla, but I'm sure everyone's got their favorites.Loud enough to ""feel the air"" and coax a variety of natural-sounding distorted tones. Stick an SM-57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking it's a tube amp. By working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound, along with that ""barely breaking up"" holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players.By learning how much you can do with relatively little, you'll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone-shaping tools that have come along since.It might surprise those who take today's hyper-saturated, over-processed metal distortion for granted as the official, community-sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain.One bit of weirdness: When I began playing my Pignose I immediately noticed a buzz, as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill. The four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and, sure enough, an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly. Fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage.Get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice.The first amp I ever had was a small Ampeg tube from the early 60's with a single 6 inch speaker, volume and tone knobs. I've no idea how many watts it put out - not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door. With that baby cranked, I spent many happy hours in tone heaven. All these years (and amps) later I guess I've always been searching for that sound and the Pignose comes closer than any tube distortion, blues overdrive pedal or rat-ty box I've tried.For the money, you can't beat it."
975,712,4.0,"Fantastic. Just love this little amp.At first thought it was broken, but batteries were  not sitting in right.Very happy it's ok."
451,712,4.0,"Sounds simply great!  As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be.  Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume, it changes its distortion (the louder, the more distorted).  The Pignose power supply (Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100) is helpful when been home, but also works with 6 AA batteries.  You can also amplify it's sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp.  It comes with really nice looking stickers.  I'm planning to keep it for years.Update on review(Jan 9, 2013).I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps, but as time goes by, I just fall more in love with my Piggy!  I've learned to use better it's own volume combined with the guitar's.I have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose, but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives; I cannot get this crunch with the other amps, no matter how much pedals, bells, whistles I have tried... This crunch is unique and the world loves it, as simple and plain as that.  The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love with.The 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble (the one that make teenage girls sigh for you...) with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar."
728,195,4.0,"Using this to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet. It is holding a Shure SM57 microphone.  The microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic, but I'm using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads."
695,195,4.0,"This little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size. The locking knobs do their job without fail and I don't have to over crank them to get them to hold. I use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer, recording interface and all the other stuff I use for recording. It adjust perfect for vocals and I drop it down if I want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup. Same with my violins. I get a different sound recording through a mic than I do a pickup.The base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way. You must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction, it will stand securely in any direction. I set it where I want it then just swing it out of the way till I need it. I have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics. It's just more accessible on the desk. This would work fine for drummers.I would recommend this to any of my critical buddies. Thanks"
939,195,4.0,This mic stand will work great for mic'ing full stacks and guitar amps.Some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone. You should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg.
1120,195,3.0,"Just got this stand today.First impressions are always important, and this stand gave me a good impression.It seems to be made solid enough, not like some cheap off brand crap.The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over.The telescope mechanism is quite well made.Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters.I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall. It's quite the perfect height for when I'm seated on my stool.One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place. It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved. Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others.Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs."
1405,195,4.0,"this is a great stand for anyone looking to mic up their guitar amp, seems well built and rugged, although the mic clip is just a cheap plastic component you should immediately replace!"
178,195,4.0,Rock Solid! Sturdy! Everything about it is exactly how you would want it to be. I use this to MIC my Blackstar 2x12 Cab with an SM57
1420,195,4.0,"I look at many stands before I brought this one, the rating were great and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  If I need another stand I will buy this one again with no hesitation."
416,195,4.0,This is a well made table top stand. The weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease. I would get this stand again.
59,195,4.0,"I have quite a few mic stands, and picked this up to use for micing a guitar cabinet. I love the low profile and the design of the feet - it's very sturdy, and all around better than the DR stands that I have which cost twice as much. It has plenty of weight to it and enough reach to easily reach all 4 speakers in my 4x12 without becoming &#34;tippy&#34;.5/5, though it would have been nice if it shipped with more than just the single cable clip."
6,343,4.0,"I purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin, she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin."
484,343,4.0,"Its much better than what I got with my violin.  Its been good I can't really complain, considering its basically tree sap."
1014,343,2.0,it's ok but a little cheaper quality than I expected.  I would recommend going a little higher price.  It also arrived cracked.
1250,343,4.0,I had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply.  This rosin is great because it's encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin.  It's so easy to apply and doesn't leave any messy residue on my fingers.  I haven't been playing the violin for very long but did know I needed something to rosin the bow easily.  This was exactly what I needed.
801,343,4.0,"I got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin SUCKED big time so we got this to use instead. Works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it. I know everybody knows this already, but I've never played with a bow before, most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers."
359,487,2.0,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price, why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product, it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
140,487,4.0,"I just put this on my Dot Hollowbody.  It's a big, heavy guitar and this strap looks good and does the job.  I like how it looks and feels and would buy another one just like it.  The price was great, had the Gibson name on it and was a great value.  5 stars."
714,487,4.0,Got this for my electric guitar.  I am able to adjust it to the length I play with.  Very sturdy guitar strap.
24,487,0.0,"It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it."
1226,487,3.0,"I hope there had been a closer picture of the product.I was a little surprised when I got it because it doesn't look as great as I imagined.The white lightning is stamped on the black strap, the same goes for the GIBSON name on the end of it.Maybe it will get better looking in the long run."
1424,487,4.0,Had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong. Just a simple well made product that does the job. Perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest. Looks classic too!
426,226,4.0,"This is an original Gibson Gear replacement part. Don't change your knobs or any kind of part in your Gibson (Les Paul, SG or any other) if not for the real deal. I have a Les Paul and I definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts. Besides, they look great and will perform their job for many, many years!"
136,226,4.0,I replaced the metric pots in my Greco LP and needed new top hats. These look great and work perfectly.
1308,226,4.0,"I like replacing pickguards, truss rod covers, knobs, etc. on my guitars. This is a nice part.  Looks awesome on my Les Paul Traditional Desert Burst."
1407,813,4.0,"Like all Gibson products, this is high-quality polish that one would use on a high-quality guitar. I have used Gibson polishes for 38 years...."
679,813,4.0,"The cloth that comes with the product is a high quality polishing cloth but some idiot thought it was best to package it stuck to the bottle with a glue button that leaves glue stuck to the cloth. This glue is only removable after a expensive bath using Goo Gone or similar glue dissolving solution, then washing with warm soapy water by hand and rinsing thoroughly in clear clean running water until all soap is removed, then hanging the cloth up to air dry, preferably outdoors in the sunshine if you have that available. The cloth is so nice it is worth the time-consuming and correct method of cleaning, but is not why you buy a product that is supposed to clean and polish in the first place. Somebody better redesign the packaging for this product as the Gibson cleaner polish is first-rate and puts a high lustrous shine on the guitar surface which comes out bright, dry and hard almost like having used a high quality paste wax but without residue. Very good stuff, very irresponsible packaging for the convenience of the factory I assume but without forethought to the customer's needs."
1063,813,4.0,I bought this to get the grime and finger prints off of my Les Paul before putting it on eBay to sell. Worked great. Didn't harm the finish at all.
1325,849,4.0,"Ok here's the deal...I'm just a small home studio type of guy, and honestly I wasn't expecting much when I shelled out the $120 for this mic.  I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi-pattern mic!  The first time I recorded with it, I had it on omni mode and played some acoustic....it sounded amazing!  I can't believe this mic is that good.  Crisp, clean sound (who cares if it's made in China like that one guy says?), and very flexible usage.  I've since used it on toms, acoustic, a room mic for amps, and even some background vocals, and it has shined every time!So if you're like me and looking for a low-price LDC with multiple patterns, GET THIS.  You won't be disappointed at all!  :)"
529,849,4.0,"I bought this mic after hearing good things about it, but I had never tried it. It has impressed me quite a bit since then. I use it in a small home studio set-up, along with a Presonus Firebox and Logic Pro on a Macbook.For the price, this mic is a very good deal. It sounds much better than an Audio Technica 3035 that I had (and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic). I also got an Oktava MK-319 that is a much more expensive mic, and that was then sent to be mod'ed by Michael Joly (and therefore cost even more) and I'd say the two mics are very similar. I end up using the CAD M179 a lot more because it's less valuable, but sounds just as good.What else? It has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant. It sounds particularly great for male vocals, in my opinion, although I have used it for as a room drum-mic. I would highly recommend this mic, especially at this price point."
1397,849,4.0,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise, low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding, the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail, but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
647,538,4.0,Last forever and easy to hold onto.  Not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said.  My favorite picks.
297,538,4.0,"Great all round pick, one of my favorites.  Easy to grip and are pretty quite.  They wear out extremely fast though."
1339,538,4.0,"I recently bought a bunch of picks of different gauges and materials for a shoot out. I think you have to see what kind of tone you are looking for - yes, even in a pick (sorry guys! - but for me, this material and gauge had a full sound, without being thin and the material feels best in the fingers. (I previously used .63 gauge acetal Claytons."
1204,538,4.0,"I like these pics.  I use a variety of thickness and this are moderately thin.  good for fast strumming, etc.  they feel good in your hand and are easy to hold onto.  I would buy them again."
902,538,0.0,"Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper."
616,31,3.0,"Seriously, this is a great pedal. I can't improve upon what others have said, but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone, or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. It's run before time based effects (delay, phaser, etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster, while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or ""self oscillates"" after a while, change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet, use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise, it's been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff."
456,31,3.0,"Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...I still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it's on it's great! I've been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can't seem to turn it off!it's light, small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks it's a great deal!This is a good EQ for an excelent price, not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals."
1024,31,3.0,"For your money I can't recommend the EQ enough. It's cheap, works well, and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard."
1141,31,4.0,"Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig. It was cheap at around $20+ some change but like the other reviewers noted, it's noisy with hiss. So I took the advice of another reviewer & bought the Fish & Chips model by Danaelectro and it's terrific.I plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board, turned them both on, turned on the amp, put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max & no discernible hiss nor hum. Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable.This pedal has a cool 1950's style & appearance. It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar & amp sounds. For a modifying pedal, you cannot go wrong for the $30 price tag. If you're in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal, then you'll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one.This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars."
536,31,3.0,"I've been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job.  Yes, it could be metal, and I wish the button gave a satisfying 'click' when I step on it.  For under thirty clams I can look past these things.  I have not had any issues with noise (crackling or oscillation).  I really have no complaints at all with it's performance so I am glad I didn't shell out 3-4X more money so I can feel more secure when I unlatch my pedal board in front of gear-snobs.  I don't think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job 'opening up the sound' of boxy or dark sounding amps.  When I run it in the effects loop of my Palomino V8 (great little practice amp btw) that little amp sounds HUGE.  Also great in front of my Blues Jr.  If you own an amp with a single tone knob (Pro Jr, Valve Jr etc) or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these. Even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp's controls, this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead.  Once my sound is dialed in, I leave typically leave it on and forget about it.  It's also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar-"
565,31,4.0,I wasn't expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise. I use it to zero in the tone of my Alvarez acoustic for live shows. The pedal is quiet and solidly built. The price is great too.
1134,31,1.0,"This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. Even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs."
694,31,4.0,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;, and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar, I'd recommend this."
1304,31,4.0,"I bought this EQ pedal to use with a 70's amp project. I replaced the speaker and needed some mids so I bought this pedal to use for a clean channel. The EQ and boost works great for being a plastic box. I have seen the F&C; be called 'pure gold in a plastic box' on a Telecaster forum and read reviews all over the net saying the same thing.The EQ works wonders for tone and is priced less than it's MXR and Boss counterparts. I am not going to rehash all the other reviews, but I use it with a bass/guitar amp and it works surprisingly well with the old amp and a passive bass. The boost combined with the 2 low bass EQ's works wonders for low end.I use a Boss GE-7 EQ pedal with a different amp, and the F&C; works as well as the Boss as long as you don't mind the cheap construction from Danelectro. I do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesn't matter to me. I am wondering how long the switch will last though, but at this price, who can be critical.Some Danelectro pedals can be sorted into the novelty realm, but this one is actually very functional and can open up all new sounds. I also tried the EQ with a Telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end. I hope this lasts as long as my old all plastic FAB distortion that I bought used for $5."
529,31,3.0,"These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more ""brilliance"" to the tone. The case is plastic, not very attractive, and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use, so I'm not worried about that. Anyway, there aren't many EQ's on the market, and for the price, it can't be beat. I would recommend it."
320,31,4.0,"Had this for about 3 years now - it works great, and for 30 dollars, it was a heck of a bargain.The construction is ok - it's plastic with a metal + rubber bottom, but seems sturdy.  Battery is easy to get in and out, and comes with one (but is not shipped connected to the terminals).Signal wise, if on, it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static, which raises the noise floor by a hair.  The noise isn't noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off.  Besides, if you are boosting the high end, you are going to get hiss.Works great in front for a clean or unclean boost, but I tend to use it in the fx loop - where it does what it's supposed to do.  I think it's a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup, especially if the amp's EQ isn't doing it for you, or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal - this thing fixes it all!I would definitely choose this over more expensive EQs, but I tend to take good care of my stuff."
1145,31,4.0,"This pedal, fish and chips, which i find it to taste nothing like, works nicely.And was pretty cheap..I've heard some complaints/worries about the flimsiness of the plastic.As of 03.13 the plastic seems pretty thick/durable.The switch does seem of a poor quality, but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourself.As for noise, It doesn't seem to add much, unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high, and with distortion and what have you.I haven't gotten to blast (play bedroom level, technically) since i've gotten it, but it sounds good through the headphones.I'm using a squire strat, fryette sas distortion, now the fish and chips, boss me-50 all running into, for now, my vox vt20+, which is outputting to my headphones. soooo...Its sounding nicer that way.I cant wait to get it through my other amps.I've also heard of very very short battery life. I've got the standard 9v i think from planet waves and it's powering it just right, so far.Tomorrow's the real test, a few hours at least"
1364,746,4.0,I have a Fender T Bucket acoustic guitar and I put heavy guage strings on it. As beginner these strings were not good for me. I tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings. Good quality. Glad I bought these.
1022,746,3.0,"Nice overall, with a good sustained ring from the steel strings (1-2) and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings (3-6).  I like the sound I get on my Yamaha acoustic."
1318,746,4.0,"I love these strings, I've tried others but I always come back to these, great for beginners, the phosphor Bronze provide a lower/deeper tone that I prefer, but still very bright."
1096,746,4.0,Who say's Ernie Ball can't make good Acoustic Strings. This set sounds just fine and for the money forget about itThanks Amazon! :o-)
177,746,4.0,"What can I say, they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still, after all of these years and innovations in strings, Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
1135,357,3.0,"I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings, I can't really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge, but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I'm not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that I'm using them on, is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway, so everything sounds nice and smooth. Overall, I'm satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings, but I don't think I'm ready to give up DAddarios yet."
1072,357,4.0,Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!
729,357,3.0,"Ernie Ball is really on to something with the Slinky series, offering a nice range of weights. I swear by the Slinky, after being conned into a a set of Mexican-Made Martins."
627,357,4.0,I use these strings on some of my acoustic guitars. good brand and good tone. 5 stars for this one.
553,513,4.0,Ernie Ball Acoustic strings will bring your tired guitar to life.  My playing sucks - sounds better with these strings.  Bright and warm at the same time.  Great tone.  Easy on the fingers
224,513,4.0,"I installed these on a Silvertone SD10, which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar.  They are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory.  If you are looking for a regular/medium string, these are real nice. Great product."
323,513,4.0,"I have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness. No mud, clear mids and highs with clashing. Mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now. Love it."
221,158,4.0,"These guitar strings are nothing special, and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be. They work well, look good, and are fairly durable at a very low price. I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh, shiny set of new strings. For playing, they sound pretty good. Best part, in my opinion, is that they're made in America, as well as the majority of Fender products. If you want to spend the extra money, I'd stil recommend Ernie Ball over these, or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these Fender strings. You get what you pay for. As far as shipping, Musician's Friend did a great job getting the order out quickly. I'll be ordering from Musician's Friend again."
47,158,4.0,"I bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it.  After a month of using those strings I decided to replace them since I was having trouble keeping the low E string in tune.  I put these strings on and compared to the &#34;default&#34; strings, it was almost silky and softer by comparison.I'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel. The sound was much nicer to my ears as well.  They were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar."
140,158,4.0,"These are the Gold standard for all Strat type electrics, Fender or not.  I put these 150's on all of my Strats regardless of the brand.  They are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great.  I tend to play my Strats a bit rougher than my Gibson's or acoustics so these are well tested in my house.  I get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit.  I will continue using these on all of my Strats until I find something better which I haven't yet.  I do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well.These are bullet proof.  They take a pounding and last as long as you could expect!!!"
136,158,4.0,"Don't know what it is but I love the sound of these strings, placebo? Maybe but IMO these are the best sounding strings I've played with."
142,158,4.0,I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well.  I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound.  I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat.  They sounded great.  I use these for my telecaster in 10 -46 (factory spec) and they are real nice too.I do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets.  I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period.  Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did!
429,158,4.0,"You want a Fender to sound like one, and using these strings helps with that. I have them on a MIA Telecaster and they stay in tune and have good sustain. I'm happy with them."
1197,158,3.0,"I like these 9-42 Pure Nickel strings ... nice tone, work well on my Stratocaster with Fender locking tuners ... great combo, even with ghost bends, slides, and pounding with Drop D and Open G tuning."
1088,259,3.0,Decent strings I used for a beat up strat that I had. Nothing to special but it was good enough for that. I'd recommend these.
428,259,3.0,Same kind that come on all guitars from the Fender factory. Classic sound. I have switched to D'Addarios to capture that Frusciante sound.
79,259,4.0,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel, sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
231,258,4.0,I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!
349,258,4.0,"I had changed my strings with some new Martins I got recently. They were bloody awful! Luckily, I'd also picked up a package of these Ernie Ball strings. First of all, they were packaged better than the Martins, they went on more easily and after I tuned up, they sound SO much better! Thank you Ernie Ball, for making far superior strings. My guitar thanks you as well (grin)."
1169,258,3.0,i was pretty happy with them when i got them and finally used them and will likely pick up more once i need them.
949,258,4.0,I always LOVE THESE!Moreso because I am not getting ripped off by a Brick & Mortar shoppe for a tool of the trade.
77,258,4.0,"Have always liked  Ernie ball products,so I thought I would like to try their strings,to see how they work,I am very pleased !"
423,258,3.0,"I've used GHS medium bronze wound strings on my Martin D-18 for several years. I thought I'd give these Ernie Ball strings a shot after reading reviews. They are lighter than I expected. They are closer to ""light"" than medium. I'm not that impressed. They sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets. I think the next set I buy will be medium and probably GHS. You never know until you try.Update: I've gotten used to the 'sound' of these strings and I DO like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing. Pure Bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow BG sound, though. ;) At my age I need all the help I can get, so I'll have to admit that I like do like these strings."
939,258,3.0,These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they don't feel as good either.I guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings.
1304,258,4.0,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great, I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
946,258,3.0,I use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough I can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound
391,258,1.0,I don't like the feel or sound of these strings.  I bought both the .010 and the .011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil.  I would not buy these again
551,258,3.0,"put them on my daughter's guitar, and she enjoys them.  anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing.i'll take ernies over martins, but not over d'addarios on my guitars though."
600,17,2.0,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means, but for what they're worth, I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price, ability to collapse, and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
489,17,1.0,It is not the size for mini guitar. May be for the big one...Connections are shaky. You will surely notice that the quality is toooo low.
770,17,0.0,"Total flimsy junk. It leans WAYYY too far back. I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things. On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.In summary... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
274,17,4.0,"Excellent compact guitar stand. Folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag. Not as stable as some stands but for the size and price, can't be beat. Thanks to Amazon for offering such a good product."
35,17,4.0,"I love these little guitar stands. They are small enough to go anywhere with you, and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around. Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am.The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths. The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage. The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage. I know, I know... but they really are cool little stands, and I just bought another one lol. I am a glutton for punishment!"
272,17,4.0,"I needed a small, collapsible stand which would fit in my backpack with my little amp cables and stuff. This is perfect, love it."
119,17,3.0,"Fender came up with a fine electric guitar holder - one of two new models, the other for acoustic guitars. Well built, reliable, folds up, takes little room to care around. Ideal for gigs as well as studio and home. Solid performer. - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'"
88,17,4.0,"I needed some little, easy, and portable guitar stands for the stage.  This does it perfectly, well.  While being light and portable."
618,17,4.0,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar, the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
1234,17,4.0,"The fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender / Squire mini guitar. the guitar falls through. I will have to buy a differant stand for him, rendering this one useless. The fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 3/4 size ether."
978,17,4.0,"I have two of these stands, the electric guitar/bass version and the acoustic version. Back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case. Yes -- folded up it WILL fit in my tweed Fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar (I DO always keep it IN the included stand bag to ensure I don't scratch or bump it against my guitar). Great at this price too, buy several!"
1243,796,4.0,"Easy to pack, easy on the instrument, light weight but sturdy. An excellent value and a great gift idea too!"
863,796,4.0,"this thing is sturdy, inexpensive, and does it's job.  no scratches or anything on my taylor.  it falls over now and then but only when i run into it"
612,796,4.0,"This stand easily folds, and holds my Mandolin in a scratch-proof stance.  Not good for smaller instruments, like the name may imply to some.  An attempt to hold a smaller ukulele miserably failed, but everything from Tenor uke and up, did just fine! :)"
372,796,3.0,"This is an good stand for situations where there aren't too many threats to your guitar (running dogs on the porch, reeling drunks at a bar). Get a heavier stand or a wall hanger if you have a fabulous vintage Martin or a handmade Henderson. Overall, well worth the price."
354,796,4.0,"Small light and stays out of the way,  it just works.  Folds up if needed for travel.  I use with Stratacoustic."
912,796,4.0,It is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag. So if it is outside the bag of course I can showcase my guitar. The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too. It stands as it should and it was a snap (literally) to set up it was like three steps or something. Wow. I am very impressed considering the price!!!!
1204,796,4.0,"this little stand is great.  I am looking at it right now, across the room, holding my Zager guitar.  it is light, non obtrusive, holds the guitar well, and it is portable when Mr. Guitar and I take a trip together.  I highly recommend it.  keeps that guitar off the bed, floor, table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be."
1149,796,3.0,"Not your average Giant Clumsy Guitar Stand, but it works. The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support. If you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs, or even fairly large cats, a larger stand might be a better choice. If your household is quiet, this is very much a good bargain."
613,796,4.0,"I have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars. I have 4 classical guitars, 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string.  It's very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over.  It's a really great, quality stand for the price.  They don't take up a lot of room and they're very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you're traveling.  I highly recommend it.My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible, easily-accesible place that I would practice more, even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right.  Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session, I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room - there they are, I just pick any one of them up and start playing.  It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadn't realized that I always had the excuse that I didn't have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn't take up a lot of time, for some reason kept me from practicing.  I guess out of sight, out of mind.  But now I keep my guitars out, and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music I'm working on and the stand out.  Yes, it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful."
491,796,4.0,Inexpensive. Light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar. Folds up and can easily be stored. Highly recommend this for the guitar player.
879,796,4.0,"I've got three of these simply because they work and they're easy to carry from place to place...and I insist on a stand for my guitar, none of this &#34;leaning' stuff."
749,796,3.0,I like the size of the stand and the flexibility.  Easy to put together and holds my guitar very well.
207,796,4.0,I haven't really used this guitar stand because I have been keeping my acoustic guitar in the case so I can keep the humidity nice adding water to a sponge I cut and placed into a plastic bag that I poked tiny holes in with a small nail.  The stand works as advertised.
1160,796,4.0,This little guitar stand works very well.  I like it much better than the larger stands that support a guitar by the neck.
939,796,3.0,This item does the job. I don't have any real marks against it but I've seen better stands out there.
893,796,4.0,This little stand collapses and sets up so easy.  Holds my guitar perfectly.  May buy one for my dad next!
678,796,4.0,"If you perform at gigs, you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue.  This is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations.  I used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasn't really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around.  This stand does the trick beautifully.  Nice job, Fender."
993,796,4.0,"It was cheap to buy but works just fine. I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does. The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching. It is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely. Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar. In that case, I would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier."
1096,796,4.0,"Extremely lightweight, compact and portable, it folds up really small so that you can carry it in your guitar case, gig bag or tuck it in the back of your amp,"
839,796,4.0,"I folds down to a very small size but is quite strong. I have a dreadnaught resting on it now, ready for use. It should work very well with any size acoustic guitar. Sitting by itself, the stand is small enough to be out of the way but is able to hold my precious guitar securely when put to use.  When I get another guitar, I will get another Fender stand to go with it."
1394,796,4.0,"My guitar doesn't fall down anymore.  Looks nice, displayed in the corner of my office.  Very light, but sturdy and is portable.  The only &#34;Fender&#34; I'll ever be able to afford!"
499,796,4.0,This stand feel sturdy and strong.Compact design on stand and folding for travel.Good for acoustic and electric guitars.Thick non scratch foam is a plus.Love it.
582,796,4.0,"I take workshop style guitar courses at a local Vo-Tech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose. People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old ""El Kabong"" cartoon), and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.It's not the sturdiest, most secure or most stable design out there, but given it's extreme portability and the use I'll put it to, it's going to work great."
599,794,4.0,GREAT strings!  Good quality and very good sound.  These seem a lot more stable than the 10-46 I had been using.
1137,794,4.0,"i play metal / hard rock and have used many different strings, these give the best tone and depth you need to play hard music"
949,794,4.0,the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on. I am a fan of the Slinky guitar strings so I got these for my freetless Schecter 4 string bass. Like they were made for it.
598,794,4.0,"The these strings are fantastic. The sound is deep and heavy, which is exactly what I was looking for. Makes the bass sound pretty bad@$$. I cranked up the bass amplifier after putting on these strings and the sound is pure, powerful, and blew me away.Well worth the money."
151,794,4.0,"Feels great, sounds great, there's a little bit of magic in these strings. High quality classics add a touch of class to your sound."
647,241,4.0,I bought this to put the new strings on my guitar but the shipping info said it wouldnt be here for a few more days.  I restrung my guitar without it and it showed up in the mail a few hours later.  I can say its built much better than I thought it would be.  Feels like its built to last.
464,241,4.0,"Works just fine. Except the little knob that's supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings (the little pins or whatever) it doesn't grip onto mine (I have an acoustic jasmine takkamine) so I had to get out pliers from my toolbox, but that's okay. One size doesn't always fit all. Good price."
779,241,3.0,It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter. The design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy. With some acquired technique this tool does a job.
6,241,4.0,"bought this on a whim and I am glad of it, I have not used the string winder part yet but the cutter makes short work of both guitar and mandolin strings without the risk of marring the head, just be careful you can pinch yourself if you are not careful."
1036,241,4.0,"Changed the strings on my Epiphone EB-0 bass today for the first time using this product.Fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare.  Cutter works great, winder makes the job really fast.  10 minutes it took for all 4 strings.  Next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing.  Highly recommended"
851,241,3.0,I won't rant about a string winder..  They aren't that technical of an item but I do like the string cutter.  I do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but I am not going to be that picky..  This unit works just fine and I am sure that I will lose it before It breaks..
48,241,4.0,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time, these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
47,241,3.0,"It works fine for the regular guitars but the bass guitar has these very wide tuning pegs.  This winder has a slot that will sorta fit across this tuning peg but it doesn't feel like it has enough of a grip to make turning it easier.I haven't had a chance to actually use it while changing strings yet, but so far it looks like it'll work as advertised in every other aspect."
1242,241,3.0,i always keep these around during string changes. i prefer the bass version to this if you can find it
1138,241,3.0,"It works pretty well on my ukulele, however it left several dents and scratches on the tuners of my ukulele."
1221,241,3.0,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams, but alas, I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully, but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference, so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all, a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily, the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge, which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own, I suppose."
691,241,4.0,"This is such a lifesaver (or an effort saver). Every guitarist should have this. In my opinion, there is nothing more annoying in the world than changing guitar strings. This makes the process so much easier. It's a 3-in-1 product that clips the old string, pulls the pins out, and winds the new strings in. On top of it all, it's pretty affordable."
388,241,3.0,"The winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."
1022,241,4.0,"I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars, but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact, I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding, since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great, one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works, and though it is a tighter fit than I expected, it does work and means I don't need to find a pliers.  Overall, I am very pleased and saved time on string changes."
1015,241,4.0,"Use it every time I restring my guitar, works really good. I recommend this to any musician that plays regulary."
234,241,3.0,"I found this tool to be convenient and better made than I anticipated, making it a solid value for the money.  No need for a collection of separate tools anymore."
847,241,3.0,This does a fine job of cutting even a thick E bass string. Very pleased. Also works to cut ukulele strings! Hooray hooray hooray.
500,241,4.0,"String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth, the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy, but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function, would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands, but other than that, it's perfectly perfect. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
15,241,3.0,"I probably should buy another one for other guitars, but I carry in my electric case.  I'm sure the day I will need it, I will have acoustic with me!  I use different method for my bass, but this is perfect for 6 strings!"
53,241,3.0,"Its a nice pice,, easy to use and necessary when you change the string of your guitar,,, the only matter and its not a big deal,, is that make a squeaking sound besides that works perfect"
1370,241,4.0,This tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a reasonably priced product.  As with any tool there is a small learning curve just to become familiar with the way it functions.  After using it a couple of times I can only give it high marks.
715,241,4.0,My son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar. It hasn't failed him yet. It's easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly. He says it's a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings. Highly recommend.
168,241,4.0,"Works well for a multi-tool.  personally you could get away with a little crank winder and a wire cutter, but this is nice to have in your bag just in case.  And for the price you really can't beat it.  3 tools in one handy spot."
534,241,4.0,"Makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller, and cutter all in one. Arrived quick and before scheduled. These work perfect for my needs"
682,241,4.0,"Before bying this product, I doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings. I received it and the first thing I did is try it. IT CUTS THE MEDAL STRINGS LIKE BUTTER. I used to use whatever I could find around the house which was a pain because nothing I tried could cut these metal strings. The winder I'm not going to use, but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it."
890,241,3.0,"I realy like the cutter. The only thing, for me, was the peg winder was getting in the way.With just a simple screw it comes right off. I much prefer it without the winder. Build quality is awesome. Sturdy and a bit weighty. Definitley worth a buy."
467,241,4.0,I have tried a few and this is the one I settled on if you need a multi-tool.  The cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up.  The winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good.
1388,241,4.0,It winds! It cuts! You really can't go wrong here. Another really well-made product from Planet Waves that will become an indespensable part of your guitar setup.
73,241,4.0,"Light weight, compact, and all in one tool, what more could I ask for?This tool does three things very well, turns tuners on stringed instruments quickly, cuts musical instrument strings, and helps pull acoustic guitar string pins. What's not to like? Well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open - guess I'm used to side cutters or pliers - and it doesn't cut strings really close to the tuning pin - it leaves about a half inch of string hanging. Oh, if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar (go to the Elixir Strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the Taylor guitar factory) your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners. The alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more.I find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings, somebody could manage to break this plastic tool. The tool is made of sturdy plastic. If abused, trying to cut copper wire, it might break; but the tool was never designed for that use.I've used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time. I use this on three different guitars, an acoustic and two electrics (Les Paul and PRS). The pin puller works just fine, I actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood. The tool fits inside my hard shell Gibson guitar case. This is a very nice tool."
1021,241,4.0,"Easy to use and makes changing out strings easy. The winder is great, but the cutter and pin pull is also part of it making it the only tool needed for changing out strings. The construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts."
140,241,4.0,"Perfect for re-stringing your guitar.  Very portable too and fits in my gig bag with spare strings.  The price was right too.  This is a must have tool and isn't cheap like most of the plastic ones out there.  The nice thing about this one is it  cuts off excess with ease, just looks better trimmed neatly.5 star product"
723,241,4.0,"After getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings, I finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget. I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didn't expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great! It also has a pin puller which I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's great as well. This would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician, or if you just want a great all in one tool. But this thing!"
137,241,3.0,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me, so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried, I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings, and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
1334,241,4.0,It's so much easy to deal with your guitar using this string winder and cutter! A w e s o m e!
840,241,4.0,This is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it..  i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise.  Its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out.  the wire cutters also work really well. Im glad i bought this product.
664,241,4.0,"For about $8 you get a string winder, string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one.What more can you ask for?Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use.I have nice wire cutters, etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three.As for quality, it has an unconditional guarantee, see above.Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories.To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking, try using your warranty instead of whining.No manufacturer has a perfect run forever, but at least in this case you have not wasted your money.For the record, I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)"
1177,241,3.0,I have used this winder now 4 times.  It does what it is supposed to do and adds to speed and efficiency of the task.
480,241,4.0,"Works a little better at winding strings than the bare-bones winders. The string cutter is very handy. The pin puller, as is usually the case, is a little clumsy to use, but it works."
1037,241,4.0,"Finally, a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated, works well regardless of string composition type,...stainless, chromes, core-types, etc.  The price seems fair enough.  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money, but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast...... get a 'roadie' to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries."
1095,241,4.0,This is exactly what I was hoping for. The string cutter works better than expected. It's nice not having to go hunt down diagonal pliers when it's string changing time. The only little issue is that it's a little tougher to spin really fast than the little string winders because of the grip. No biggie though.
210,241,4.0,"I've only used the string winder so far, but it works well so far. I use it on my guitars and my banjo. The other things look like they will work well, but I haven't used them yet so I can't say for sure. If not then I'll update this review (if I can)."
750,241,4.0,What  great idea to put all three tools needed when changing strings into one tool. The cutter even works well.
471,241,4.0,"You need nothing else to replace your string, no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar, or both. I have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage. is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you (like me) don't like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache.Recomended!"
498,241,4.0,"This product is something every guitar owner needs.  It is well built, performs well and sells at a very reasonable price.  The sting cutter works well."
1244,241,4.0,"This winder makes changing strings a breeze and I like that there's an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string.  I also love the part on the end that pulls out the pins from the bridge.  So, this item is three tools in one!"
1137,241,4.0,"I have had other string winders, but this had the string cutter on it too. It is awesome. I broke a string on stage and instead of having a big floppy string, with just a quick squeeze it looked good. HIGHLY reccomended"
809,241,4.0,"This guitarist tool is a real gem; it's well designed to pull string pegs, wind strings, and cut the strings - all in a small package. I find it handy, useful, and I recommend it."
269,241,1.0,"Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  You'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips."
1065,241,4.0,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking, bending, becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy, you'll love it, and if not, you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
417,241,4.0,"After years of using a diagonal pliers, this small and secure to use around top line guitar/bases, this guys just made my #1 none StewMac tool in my tool set."
233,241,4.0,"It is a string winder, what more can I say. It works as it should and saves time. Very useful when restringing a guitar."
403,241,4.0,"This bad boy rocks, fits in guitar case, it slices it dices it makes julienne fries. Well no, but  it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and wind/unwind guitar strings, though.If it had a flashlight, tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect, but engineers are mortal and I couldn't put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case (at least not without coating it with butter first).Its plastic and steel, it will break eventually as everything does - imperfect world, re &#34;breakfast club&#34; bolts fall out, doors fall off, but til then I'll enjoy using this. The string winder is a little awkward. I have a little fender brand gizmo that looks like a pez dispenser with a swivel head on top, its small so I keep it in the guitar case along with this contraption - winds strings much faster than this device, but if you've got the time this one will work just fine. I also wear two pairs of socks in case one gets a hole in it, I'm prone to redundancies.It may be sheer rumor, but I have it on good sources, that this item is actually based on alien technology recovered at Roswell New Mexico. Your chance to own alien technology at an affordable price not like those I-phones that they took out of the saucers.If it only came in mink it would be perfect."
689,241,4.0,"everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy, add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set"
1101,241,3.0,"I'm not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder.  Maybe if you change strings a lot, then this could be a key part of you equipment bag.  The cutter part is nice, it is solid and effective without being too heavy, yet it does feel well made.  For the price, keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings."
1262,241,4.0,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough, I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done, this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings, I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
223,241,4.0,"What a great multipurpose guitar tool. It works great. I really like the fact that it is cutter, a winder, and a pin remover, all in one. The quality is really nice. Next time I place an order, I'm going to get another one as a spare. I'd be lost without this tool."
1301,241,3.0,"Stripped down one of my basses at the weekend, found this very useful, made stripping and replacing strings really easy. Large enough to fit the fender tuners. Have 2 new sets of strings on order so fitting them won't be as daunting a task as without this item."
1228,241,3.0,This is a pretty cool item. I bought I thought it was cool and different. Is well worth the price and a good thing to have in your guitar case.
1042,241,4.0,Works great for changing guitar strings. Good build and doesn't look cheap. Built-in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus.
1249,241,4.0,This tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar. It gets the job done easily and very fast.
433,241,4.0,A must have for anyone to make changing strings on any guitar especially an acoustic. Really like the clippers and bridge pin puller a lot. Would make a great gift for any musician playing a stringed instrument.
430,241,4.0,"Great tool. I used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys, but this trims steel and nylon with ease. The quick slack take-up winder is nice also, but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars"
899,241,4.0,It cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand. It is very solid and will last a long time.
1313,241,4.0,Really helpful both in live gigs and at home.Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand
875,241,2.0,Its great for cutting strings but the winder is pretty difficult if you don`t know what your doing. Warning for beginners don't get this!!!!
1183,241,3.0,The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter.
1023,241,3.0,Nice quality and love the cutter. The winder is a little awkward to use. I guess I need a little practice. But the cutters are great.
93,241,4.0,"When i bought this, i didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. It seemed a little plastic-ie from the photos, so i didn't think it was going to hold up very well. It actually really surpassed my expectations however. The winder itself works quite well, and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. It was a little wobbley on my guitar, but still worked well. The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem. For 7 dollars, it's a really good deal!"
1120,241,3.0,Bought it to replace strings for my Taylor.Does all the job that I need it to perform.Winds the strings fastPulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wireDOES NOT SCRATCH MY GUITAR!!!the only issue really is that it squeaks a lot. can be fixed with some oil.
329,241,4.0,"A lil awkward for some. But works perfect for me. Like any other tool, it doesn't always fit or please everybody. But I'm a big fan of all-in-ones. So this is a more compact option for me & less clutter inside my guitar case pocket."
983,241,4.0,"I have purchased and used many various types of Guitar String Winders and I must admit that the Planet Waves Pro Winder is the very best I have used to date.  It is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings....pull pegs..etc.  It is sturdy and should last  many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement.  Because of the affordable price on Amazon I will be buying some for my friends as Christmas Stocking Stuffers.  The Planet Waves Pro Winder is well worth the cost and I recommend it to anyone.  Also, with the string winder I also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping (free shipping) which promised that the items would be shipped within 5 to 7 days. The items were ordered on the Thursday and received on the Saturday....THREE SHORT DAYS...Treat yourself!  Thank you Amazon!"
414,241,2.0,"the winder works really well and same with the cutter, but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome.  i guess for taking w/ you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool, but if using at home, then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter.  that's what i do anyway.  still i think is a good tool to have."
1031,241,4.0,"Yes, you really replace your strings very fast with this Winder. And it also cuts the strings. Very helpful. i recommend."
687,241,4.0,"I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out, but honestly this thing is worth every penny. It cuts your changing time down drastically. You don't really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller, winder, and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool. Not to mention, it's very rigid and it certainly seems like it'll hold up for years to come!"
1423,241,3.0,This is a handy little tool. The winder is nice and the clipper works well. It doesn't pull the bridge pegs out so it doesn't get five stars from me. And don't be too rough when winding or it will break.
597,241,2.0,"The peg winder is what it is, it winds pegs and there's not much to it. The string cutter is too bulky to use in most cases so I still need a set of snips when using this thing."
992,241,4.0,I thought it would be resin or plastic.Not so: It was made heavier and nicer.The metal must-have will be in the family a while I can tell.
1375,241,4.0,winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well  you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well.
321,241,3.0,"This combo string winder, peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately. It fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle. It is inexpensive enough that I have one in each of my gig bags and cases. In some ways it's like a bic pen, it's cheap enough that if you leave it someplace or lose it you can replace it."
169,241,2.0,Does the job well enough
74,241,4.0,Simply one of the best string winders I have ever used to date and I love it because I having large hands it really makes a difference. Not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot. Very good.
1278,241,4.0,"This versatile tool does what it says it does.  Pretty good quality. But, after purchasing, I realized that a tool like this isn't too necessary.  Some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks. But, it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient."
946,241,3.0,Every guitar player should own this tool. instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool.
716,241,4.0,"This is another useful item from Planet Waves for the guitar player. This winder saves time,especially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every string.This is not bulky & fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room. Worth the price."
450,241,4.0,"This product works well, but I still end up doing it the old fashion way.  Guess I am not a gimmick person.  :-)"
667,241,4.0,"Very handy, has multiple benefits that are very useful. I just had to loosen the screw that holds the winder a bit and lubricated it with silicone spray and done deal!"
1153,241,4.0,This tool has high marks for one reason: It works. This is the best at combining two tools into one. Give it high marks for form and function. Love it.
188,241,3.0,"I got this for my daughter, a begining guitarist, she has been playng for 3-4 months. She absolutely loves it. The product works perfectly and is durable. The downsides are it's a bit awkward to turn, but easy to get used to. It is very hard to accurately cut the strings."
79,241,4.0,"Makes changing strings a whole lot easier. If you are a guitar player and are changing strings like I was without one of these, stop and get one trust me!"
615,241,4.0,I never had one of these until I had to twist each tuner around 60 times to change a string.  But that's not a problem any more.I used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends.  But that's not a problem any more.And I used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic.  But that's not a problem any more either.All solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case.  So I'm a fan.  You'll be too.
1286,241,4.0,"After you have used this tool for the first time, you say to yourself,...&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there, winding forever by hand. With this winder, you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts, that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;, I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
807,241,3.0,"Overall, I like this winder.  It's handy having the wire cutter built into it.  But when I am winding new strings, it often slips off.  Since I am using one hand to hold tension on the new string, I would prefer this to hold on more securely so I don't have to put it back on several times.  But all in all, it's a lot better than winding by hand, and it seems sturdy."
424,241,3.0,"It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet, but it could be better.1. It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this.2. It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot.3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great, you just have to be careful.4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better.All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose. And well, maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find. Everything I have seems to be jet black."
855,241,1.0,"The wire clipper and winder work O.K., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. Bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. I end up using a Jim Dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. I've done it successfully for years."
287,241,3.0,The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere.
496,241,4.0,"Does the job, i've had this for about 7 months and it hasn't let me down yet...except for that time I couldnt find it. The winder, the cutter and the pin-pull all work well enough. Noted,  I've only used it to cut Elixir Nanoweb strings and nylon strings and they more on the soft side compared to regular steel strings."
220,241,4.0,i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands.
609,241,4.0,"I love being able to wind the strings, pull bridge pins and cut excess string with one tool! That frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff. Seems solid and well built."
194,241,4.0,A string winder and cutter ! This is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times ! It even has a peg puller for people who have pegs on their acoustic guitars. Great quality product...I will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly.
1143,241,4.0,"I've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. I recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings.The different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one. I was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well. The string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. So handy!"
20,241,4.0,"I used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar (Fender Strat). I was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked. The end that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well, you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings. I highly recommend it."
392,241,3.0,It's nice having all of the tools on one device. The pin puller is very slim and works better than the puller on the basic string winders. I like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well.
1159,241,4.0,"It's a great string winder, and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool. It's a brilliant idea haha. It's very good quality, like all planet waves products."
232,241,4.0,Great quality product. Saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome. Highly recommended
114,241,4.0,This was the first time I've ever used a string winder and cutter. It make the process of replacing the strings so much faster. The tool works great and is sturdy. If you try this you will never go back to stringing by hand Guaranteed.
193,241,4.0,"I purchased this for my guitar lessons studio to teach beginners how to string their guitars properly.To my surprise, I am very impressed with it, now it doesn't compare to a $60 - $100 unit nor is it supposed to, it does it's just quickly and cleanly."
1106,241,4.0,Just changed strings on my Epi Les Paul and this winder\cutter performed flawlessly.  The winder fit the winding keys nicely and didn't come anywhere near touching my guitar's finish.  The cutter snips the strings with no effort.  Huge time saver and works as promised.  Very glad I bought the  Planet Waves Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter .
787,241,4.0,"Works perfect for guitar strings. Used it when I restrung my Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6. It has locking tuners, so I was able to use this to cut the strings all the way down."
202,241,4.0,"It functions as designed.  It saves time when restringing a guitar.  It's made pretty well for a plastic tool.  Definitely takes less space than a wire cutter and a cordless drill to change strings.  Admittedly, the cordless drill would be used mostly by luthiers, but you get the point."
502,241,4.0,"Alright, for the past 5 years I've been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string, and let me tell you, doing this process on 5 guitars sucks! this tool Is AWESOME! It takes about 3-5 minutes to change strings now and it's well made and durable.the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine. I'ts not perfect but neither am I So 5 stars, Would recommend to anyone."
1324,241,4.0,I love this guitar string winder.  The cutter was a real plus so I didn't have to track down my diagonal cutters.
248,241,2.0,A good piece of kit. Except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs. It's also squeakily noisy when string winding. The cutter works perfectly.
908,241,2.0,"This winder and cutter...winds and cuts fine...But the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that, &#34;...it fits virtually all guitars, banjos and mandolins...&#34;  Oh well...another lessson learned."
548,241,4.0,"It works well for guitars and basses, so long as they are the clover style. Other then that it works just like it says it will."
1053,241,2.0,"Sometimes it seems more convenient to use my hand to turn the pegs rather than use this, but it does a pretty good job. I really like the string cutter built into the frame, and the peg puller is my favorite feature. Basically, I use this for everything except winding strings."
55,241,3.0,"When I first saw this item I wondered:  Why is the regular guitar version $6.99 and the bass version only $4.99?Suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and I realized-- the bass version only has to tune FOUR strings instead of six.  So it costs less because we don't need to use it as much!But then I remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought, okay... shouldn't they have a $5.99 one for 5-string bass guitars?Sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when I realized with some dismay that there are even 6-string bass guitars.  Will this even work on a 6-string bass?  After all, that's 2 more strings than its intended purpose!These perplexing questions aside, I find this to be an excellent and ideal tool.  Its function is three-fold:1) String winder2) String cutter3) Peg pullerSo no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string.  All the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably-priced tool.  Made by D'addario, the quality lives up to the brand.  It's solid, the wire cutter and peg puller well designed.  It does everything it's supposed to do, does it well and is of good construction.PROS:  Good strong well-designed unitCONS: The winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use.  I would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening. Because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5.I note that there are reviews here as old as four years... and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time.  Some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head.  Others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys.What I believe is that it is a mistake to sell the BASS and STANDARD GUITAR version on the same page.  From what I can deduce from the reviews, it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the BASS guitar version, which does indeed have a wide and deep cup, and did not realize it.  Imho, the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity.  It's obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit.Some have reported the peg puller being ""metal"" and scratching the bridge.  The one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn't careful-- the same holds true for needle nose pliers.Bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they're doing, don't get in a rush, and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using ANY modification tool. I suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings 0 to 60 in 5 seconds... they may wind up damaging their guitar.  Turn on the light, put on reading glasses if necessary to see... and take your time and this device should work fine.  Be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date (dunno why the company didn't simply start a new listing when redesigning the device)."
1171,241,4.0,"Works as advertised. The cutter makes this thing really worth while. If I lose it, I'm buying another! 2 more words required?"
294,241,4.0,"Handy dandy little gadget. So much better than using pliers to remove bridge pins, nail clippers to cut strings and much easier to wind strings with this thing. I've got 10 guitars and 3 basses so i change a lot of strings and this definitely makes it less of a chore. Love Planet Waves stuff!"
699,241,4.0,This product is straight forward and works as it's intended.One side note - there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings. I'm not sure if all of them do this but the one I received does. It doesn't cause any problem with the product's performance... it's just loud.
412,389,4.0,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now, I go through every step of this system, and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good, and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size, and washable."
15,389,4.0,This kit has just about everything needed to clean and maintain your guitar or bass.  I would also by the Dunlop lemon oil as well.  Worth the money.
1411,389,4.0,The ultimate guitar cleaning tool I love love love this kit...  I've been using the products for years and I've been nothing but happy with their quality
534,389,3.0,I hate string noise and a dirty acoustic. This kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body. My favorite acoustic guitar is over 40 years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when I am changing chords or fingering the fret-board.
1388,389,3.0,"Unfortunately, the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place. Take two! The second set I received was in great condition, and I'm really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost. This kit literally has everything you will need (except new strings of course...) to keep your guitar looking and sounding great."
487,389,4.0,"the best thing I've purchase for my guitars this year , I'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning , the 01 and 02 are the best, restore the live of my fretboard, the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine , the only one that I've just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don't play with it after the cleaning ,but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close, you wont regret the purchase."
1182,389,4.0,My son was cleaning all his guitars after opening this gift on Christmas morning.  I am pleased with this product.
1277,389,2.0,In general it's OK but when you look at the fine writing on the fingerboard formula it says not to use on Maple; which means I can't use it on either of my Gibsons.  Probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately.
1023,389,3.0,"The products work great, applied them to my new Les Paul Ukulele for protection. The strings that came with my ukulele were junk so I decided to replace them with aquila strings. Prior to doing so I decided that I would like to prep the fret board. The frets seemed a little rough and the rosewood looked a little dry to me so....I ordered this kit to see what it would do. It comes with both fret board cleaner and even a very fine grit emery cloth for the metal frets. I thought I would try the emery cloth on the frets and was very pleased with the results. The frets are now very smooth and shiny and the rosewood fret board looks like it is much happier after a little drink.The polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster...but remember a little goes a long way so the wax should last a very long time as I am sure the other products will too.The cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument. Mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival. That is the reason I did not give this product a 5 star. It looked like the package was damaged prior to shipment since the out side package was pristine and the product was protected well inside with adequate padding.I am now going to work on my Gibson Les Paul Custom Guitar and I am sure that I will be very happy with the results!Great product which would deserve the full 5 stars if it was packaged a little better."
982,389,4.0,"While I'm spectacle on what I want to &#34;clean my baby with (Fender P Bass) and after reading many feed backs on Amazon, I decided to try this kit. My Bass is not that old, but really needed to be cleaned and polished. This kit really make it so clean, it looks better than when I purchased it new. No greasy residue either. My fret board looks so good to. Just don't use it on maple wood (the lighter color), at least that is what the directions states because it my yellow this lighter color. I can tell you that the rose wood is nice and deep colored red. The other cleaners and polishes are great too. I will definitely purchase this kit again when I run out of the supplies."
525,389,4.0,"Makes my guitar look great, from the fretboard, strings and body.  Everything conditioned and polished.  Great quality product, highly recommend"
922,389,4.0,This kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard. It's got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance.
178,389,4.0,Everything you need to keep your guitar clean and Polished and sexy! no matter if you are a horrible player like me you will get all the chicks because your guitar looks sexy! the girls will love you and the boys too!
134,389,4.0,"The Dunlop system has everything you need to keep your guitar in good condition, and looking great. It also had two soft cloths that are needed for application, removing excess and polishing. I couldn't be happier!"
1349,389,4.0,Take some time but it was well worth it.  I've always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards.  This worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before!
827,389,4.0,A good value box set of quality products. Use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape. I do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy.
459,389,4.0,"got a cleaner/polish/wax type ointment for every part of your guitar. comes with a small rag, and fret polishing pad deal....the fret pad is great and I didn't know about this type of thing till getting this kit. also comes with a step by step/stage by stage instruction pamphlet. worth it to get this kit and replace /add to it as needed."
140,203,4.0,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards.  I figured I'd give this a try.  I am so glad I did.  I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board, yuk.  Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color.  I'd like to say it looks like new, but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretch.But it looks a heck of a lot better, almost new.  I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics, but it's still a '67 USA made Fender.  I have such faith in this that I'm going to do my '77 Gibson acoustic next.Then I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them.  This stuff is great."
403,203,4.0,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it, I hadn't noticed that in the listing, maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable, my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle, good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit, I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars, haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
428,203,4.0,"Bought this to use on my 1962 Strat Reissue. After a year or so of playing the rosewood fretboard become a little dried out and rough, of course covered with 100+ hours of grime and sweat. This kit has everything you need to make your guitar feel, look, and play like new. I put new strings on after using this and man! Felt just like the day it arrived from the factory. Can slide and play much smoother with this. Serious speed improvement."
20,203,3.0,I cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after I received the product. The cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator. The fretboard turned out nicely though so I decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3. I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn't a bad buy. Just remember it isn't recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one.
72,671,3.0,"This set is not for everyone! In fact, you might have to get the neck adjusted after installing this set.  While I can see rockers laying down overpowering riffs with these my goal is to get the lowest action I can on a jazz box.  No question about the quality, though, these hold up the same fine standards as the other Slinky sets."
538,671,3.0,"Awesome strings, did what I needed them to do (Drop A/B). Good tension.Only con is that Ernie Ball strings seem to wear out fast and lose tone. So for now I'm good but in a few weeks I'll need new strings. In which case I'll probably go D'addario or Cobalts.Still, decent strings if you need cheap strings fast."
84,671,4.0,"They work great. You can buy more expensive guitar strings, just not better guitar strings. I use these on an old Gibson semi-hollow body."
1283,671,4.0,"I play Progressive and Thrash metal, and these strings hold out nicely. Tuned them down to A sharp (b flat?) and they sounded sweet. Back up to E (standard) and they provide nice full sounding tone."
754,671,2.0,"I have used Ernie Ball strings for along time.  Mostly slinky's or super slinky's.  I read the review on these and thought I would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a LP.I bought these to replace the stockers on the EPI LP 100 I just bought.  Luckily I order two packs.  I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times, not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet, and ""pop"" it broke. I had ordered two sets, so I put on the one from the new set. No problems until I got to the G string, then ""pop"" another breaker. Very sad quality.After finally getting them on and in tune (you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune, especially the E) I have to say they have a great sound to them.  Nice tone and sustain.  Great crucnhy sound for metal, but still a good clean tone too.  These are thick strings, but still bendable, just not very far.  I would rate the sound 5 stars.Unfortunately, it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are.  So I have to give these three stars overall."
301,671,4.0,I use these in standard tuning on my prs mccarty. The sound is unbelievable. Thick and creamy sound. Lasts slmost 3 weeks before the tone dies. Good price. Good strings.
548,671,3.0,So these are heavy strings that work well. I did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough.
1319,671,4.0,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also, I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings , You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
72,668,3.0,"I have finally discovered that the &#34;perfect set&#34; is a moving target. As arthritis creeps in I find myself playing heavier strings with a lower action, and these work in that respect. Another advantage of usiung this set is that it beefs up the treble side without making the bass side too boomey. (Telecaster, anyone?)"
226,668,4.0,I'm not a metal player in any means but sometimes I do get the urge. If your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 46-9. So I got these and they are awesome. They are not too big or too small. Very happy with these strings. If you want GREAT strings get fender strings. They are the best out there. But for metal (big strings) I stick with ernie ball.
590,668,3.0,"I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings. They don't have as nice and clear a tone as my d'addario or curt mangan strings, nor do they have the life expectancy, however they are cheaper and really easy to bend. Since I can't afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time, I go with these when I'm practicing. They do break alot when I play some crazy solos, which blows, and is the main reason why I'm not giving them 5s. (No it's not my technique, I've never broken a string on any other brand strings I've tried.) When I'm in the studio recording, I prefer, like I said before, D'addario or curt mangan strings, however to save money, I practice with these strings and I think it's not a bad method, as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot)."
697,668,4.0,I chose these strings based on reviews I have read on the website. I was definitely not disappointed. This string sound great on solid body electric and hollow body. I have a Dot Studio and the resonance is great for rockabilly. My son loves them for metal. We will continue to use Beefy Slinky strings!
259,668,3.0,"This isn't a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges (usually for a whammy bar) and not using these heavier strings already.I wanted a little fuller sound than the 10-46 slinky strings (aka regular slinky) and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefy's. I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar. Every time I got the higher strings in tune, the lowers would go down as much as a half note. It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings. So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws. I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress. The final time I tightened them down, the high E string broke. Since these were my only beefy's, my day was done with these strings. However, given how far I tightened the tension screws, I think I would have had to purchase an additional tension spring (not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge flush with the body.As I said, this isn't a knock of these strings. I never really got a chance to play them. Just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings. It can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a 45 degree angle to your guitar and if you aren't careful, you can damage your guitar."
392,668,3.0,I was loking for a particular sound that I jsut couldn't find with lighter strings. This set was perfect and I was able to re-create the sound Iwas looking for.
457,668,3.0,"I wouldn't recommend tuning these strings to E however, because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to E can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix. The highest I feel comfortable tuning these to is E flat. If you are doing anything at or below Drop C sharp, these strings will work out great for you."
459,668,4.0,to much string for my beginner fingers but seemed to be the real brand and a decent price.i would reorder in 9's or maybe even 10's next time
1005,395,4.0,"I use these on my acoustic Washburn, and they stay bright for weeks. I have been playing guitar for 30 years, and these are the best."
1252,395,4.0,Great EXTRA Light POLYWEB strings for guitar.  Really impressed with the PolyWeb!  These are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don't sqeek.
258,395,4.0,"My son plays electric and acoustic guitar. He uses Elixir for both and swears by them. He has had other brands, but they just don't stand up to elixir."
134,395,3.0,"What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone. I'm not saying the tone is bad, but it's not as good as quality strings with no coat. That having been said, I'm pleased with them as a string for guitar practice. They last for months without a change in tone. I don;t play much in public venues, so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do."
848,395,4.0,"These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great."
73,828,4.0,"These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150). In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. Fresh strings do sound better. It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. But I'm not certain these last so much longer. We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.June 15, 2010 Update: Elixir is a wonderful company. On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused. The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings. I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. It is so simple and so reproducible. I love this technique.I'm a huge fan of these strings now!"
805,828,4.0,"Purchased these strings after having tried the Blue Steel strings.  My son much prefers the Elixir strings. They last a lot longer than the Blue Steel strings did and he says the Elixir sound better, too."
360,828,2.0,"I've been playing guitar for over twenty years now and I've tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these Elixir coated strings.  I've come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it.  Eventually, all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs, you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn't make any sense.  If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them, even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost.Few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the U.S. and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names.  Granted Elixir probably isn't one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price?  I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way.  In fact, you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings; at least most people would be able to hear the difference.  Don't get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique (practice), getting better cables, pickups, amps, guitars etc than from just using these strings.  For better string life, just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use.  This discipline once a habit is good enough.Peace!"
676,828,4.0,"I heard about these from a friend, several years back.I teach and run a mobile recording studio and use my guitars all the time for mobile music recording and for worship services.These strings allow me to keep on keepin' on for several weeks at a time, even with constant usage.I wipe the strings after use and they still sound bright and crisp after many sessions.[...]"
327,828,3.0,"There's NO SUCH THING as a ""best string"".  From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have ""old standbys"" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect.If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.  If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings, then you definitely don't want Polywebs.The 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound.  If you don't want this sound, you could end up awarding them 1 star."
1219,828,4.0,"Im a huge fan of Elixir's!!!  This, however, is my first go with the polyweb, but there is no disappointment here!!"
1263,828,4.0,"These are the best strings you can buy, IMHO. There is hardly any noise whilst your fingers slide over the strings when you change chords. I tried other strings but I always come back to Elixir."
748,828,3.0,"great strings, deep rich tones from both highs and lows, a very good value for the dollar and customer service is second to none"
1222,45,4.0,This installed easily. A nice feature is ability to unclip the shoulder pad from the mounts on the instrument.  When the pad is installed the strap is very comfortable and eased any shoulder pain I might have had with earlier straps.  A keeper for sure.
91,45,3.0,"I used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night. I typically practice sitting down without a strap when I am alone, but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band. I had previously used a very expensive 2"" padded leather cradle type strap, which I really liked. I sold that banjo and the strap with it, but recently re-acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap, but was not willing to pay the $80 again for a premium padded leather strap. I saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance. I am glad I did.This strap may not be as elegant as fine leather, but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction. What blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo, which weighs about 14 pounds, literally felt half as heavy. It is no joke. At first, the feeling was unnerving, because the strap has some elastic give to it. You get this dual sensation of a) the banjo feeling super light and b) as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor. Paradoxical I know, but that's where the magic of this strap is. It is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you, but in reality it remains very stable when playing.Like I said, the build quality is outstanding. My only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non-traditional, so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument, like a 5-string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap.This is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point. I think I might try these on my electrics (though I already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps)."
1129,45,4.0,"Comfortable and easy to adjust for length.Additionally, it easily snaps off the banjo when you want to put the banjo in a tight case...My case is tight around the head, so I unsnap the strap and store it in the case by the neck of the banjo."
1342,45,4.0,"Padded portion of strap is quite soft and comfortable.Both ends are a loop.  You disonnect the quick release buckles and loop ends through banjo head retainer rods. Easy to do, and you can vary locationGood Product - I would from this manufacturer again."
503,45,4.0,"This is the most comfortable strap I have ever used.  I have been a guitarist and bassist for over 40 years and although I have only been playing banjo for a short time, this IS the most comfortable strap I have ever used.  The clips look solid and so far they are solid."
68,45,4.0,The strap arrived ontime and the package was in great condition.  The strap was easy to attach to my banjo and is very comfortable.  I would recommend this strap to anyone looking for a cost effective banjo strap.
558,45,4.0,"Fantastic strap.  Nope, it isn't leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff...  But it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my CC-OT banjo that has a *really* tight spacing (all the others I tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets).  Had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass, once again extremely comfortable and sturdy, so had to buy another so I can just have one on each."
47,186,4.0,"I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available, but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item, and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings, they don't measure up to the polywebs."
500,186,4.0,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
1155,186,4.0,"A bit more expensive then other strings,  But theire worth it,  the tone is outstanding,  They last a long time,  they never rally come out of tune..... and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string I've tryed.  The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone, Not to dark not to bright Just perfect.These string's are worth it!"
1032,186,4.0,"elixir makes the best guitar strings, electric and acoustic.  they last forever and don't rust.  they sound awesome.  get them."
691,760,4.0,My new go-to strings. These things last forever for someone who only plays casually. They sound great too. Absolutely recommend it.
1022,760,1.0,"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second, the high D (8th string) seems ""dead""; it does not ""ring"" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good."
850,760,4.0,I've used these Elixir strings for years and I would never change.  These have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others.
734,760,4.0,I really like the strings they sound very bright and go well with my guitar I do hope they last quite a while I put them on a bout a month ago but that guitar is only lightly played so I will try to update when I change them
328,760,4.0,These strings are performance value and always give me a great sound.  I have been using Elixir's for 5 years now and they last longer (even in this salty air environment by the beach) and sound better than anything else I have ever used.
133,760,4.0,"Taylor ships this guitar with these strings - and for a good reason!  They sound wonderful - right out of the box! Like with most/all 12-string guitars, lights or extra lights are most often appropriate - the feel of these Nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate, in tandum with the instrument, bring out it's best resonance and sustainability.Give 'em a try!"
70,760,4.0,These are my favorite strings.  They last a long time and my fingers don't hurt when I play.  I tried Martin strings once and hated them.
841,760,4.0,"These are my favorite guitar strings! They are very long-lasting and sound great!I would recommend these for anyone, beginners or even people who play seriously or perform. They are very good strings, worth the cost! :]"
207,760,4.0,The Elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep their brand-new 'sound' a lot longer than any other brand.  I am very happy with the Elixir brand strings.
236,760,3.0,I have had them on my Loar Guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine.  We will see how long they last.  I have used Elixir for electric and while they do last longer I wish it was a bit longer.
743,760,3.0,"I've used these strings longer than any other strings I've tried (about 7 years).  Last year I switched to D'Addario EXP16's because they sounded better on the guitar I have now, but still keep a pack of Nanowebs as a backup.  Here are my pros and cons of this string:Pros:+Easier to fret and play than other strings.  I don't know why; I looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings.  But they certainly are easier to fret (press down) and play than any other string I've tried, including other coated ones.  The coating on the Nanoweb strings is thinner than the Elixir Polyweb series, but still feel very smooth and even 'slippery', as some people remarked.  They have very little string squeak.+Last longer than any other strings I've tried - maybe because of their brightness, these strings mellow with age (as all strings do) but never really sound dull.  The only reason I saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke, usually every few months of regular playing.+Very bright sound, which cuts through well playing live with a full band, and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars.  However, this can also be a con (see below)Cons:-Cost more than most strings, including other coated strings.-Can sound overly bright, especially on some higher end guitars.  They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar, which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction, but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well.  For this reason I switched to the EXP16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar. The EXP16 is coated but has a more natural/dark sound that complements the 'woodiness' of the guitar better than the Elixirs (although not as easy to play).-Not available for export outside the U.S.  When I was working abroad, I used to buy these from a U.S. company who would ship them to me.  Elixir changed their policy to prevent this, so I ended up switching strings because the cost of Elixirs abroad was so high."
75,760,4.0,"I kinda strayed away from the Elixir brand for a little while just ""To See"" if another brand would sound ""better"" and in doing so, I wasted time and money.(but I did get some EXPERIENCE) I'm back with the Elixirs now and have no intentions to ""Experiment"" any more.Simply put............Elixir makes the best Strings for an Acoustic Guitar that I've tried and I ""Will Stick with them"" because they have Great Sound, last a long time, easy to clean and prevent rust and/or corrosion."
1293,760,4.0,I use mediums but bought these for my nephews Takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar.  Always love these strings.  This kid has not changed his strings in years so I thought I would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible.
627,760,4.0,"5 stars, arrived on time and in good condition. Price is excellent. Will install to one of my acoustical guitars within the next few day."
579,760,4.0,"All I can say is,,, You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself. You will not want to go back to any other set of strings. I've been using Elixir strings for many years. They have better feel, sound, and last longer than all other brands I've used playing Guitar. Elixir has excellent quality control too. I've never had a problem."
983,760,3.0,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However, I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore, strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
331,760,4.0,"I love, love, love these strings. Super great sound and super long life. I've had these on my acoustic for over 6 months before, and the sound is still awesome. I'll definitely only buy these from now on."
1079,760,4.0,Elixir strings are great for me.  They hold their tones longer.  They aren't rough textured so they are easier on the fingers.
721,760,4.0,I have a Taylor 514 ce acoustic guitar and Elixir Strings are what this very nice guitar came with from Taylor when new.  I figure they have done the research on what works best and I see no reason for a change other than going fro the extra light strings to the light weight strings.  The sound you get with the Nanoweb strings are amazing and they enhance the results from an already great guitar.  They also last a long time before they go dead.
745,760,4.0,"I've written a review before. They are excellent. Never broke a string, but I only play at home as a hobby. therefore they not abused."
386,760,4.0,"I'll never use another string on acoustics. The reduced finer squeak, the long lasting coating, and the great tone of these strings is wonderful. I've tried a couple cheaper brands recently, both coated and uncoated... but come back to these every time."
502,760,4.0,"I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are soooooo smooth. It's like playing a silk guitar. Get these strings."
1324,760,4.0,"These are expensive, they seem to last longer, but when they start to wear, they develop a 'fuzz' where - I assume - the nanoweb is wearing off.  It doesn't seem to affect the playability."
248,760,4.0,"These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are. They are so tuneful, they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful. My only concern is that if the strings aren't wound properly they seem brittle and break. e.g. Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G string.The LIGHT version I find, are particularly suited to finger picking."
1421,760,2.0,"After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret.  That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than ""regular"" strings.  I like the way they sound.  They are a little harder to play than the D' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar, and the Martins that I have used in the past.  If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost."
231,798,4.0,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic, it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings, definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not, but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
1147,798,4.0,"I've been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar (Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar). It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory. I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce. What's even better is how long they last.I'm pretty hard on my strings. I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks, 12 Pack, Purple, 1.14mmwhich are very stiff, and chew up strings very quickly. The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks. They're a little bit more expensive then other major string brands. But after about a year of listening to these (only gone through 3 sets so far), they're worth the extra few bucks."
181,798,4.0,"They feel great, last longer than any other string I ever used and most importantly, they sound terrific. The medium weight also has a better tone than thinner gauges. My Taylor is much louder now that I use these.However, you may have to adjust your truss rod if you change from lite or extra light."
1293,798,4.0,Great great great great great great great great great.  Been uning them for years.  Love the sound and playability and durability.  matin coated are good too.
1246,798,4.0,These strings are very nice and sound great. Elixer is a fantastic brand and these strings are definitely worth the price.
399,798,2.0,"I hesitate to write this review simply because it's pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings. To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed. I'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric, where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones."
321,798,4.0,I've been using Elixir strings since Gore first made prototypes over 10 years ago. I use both electric and acoustic. The product performs exactly as they guarantee it will.  Every once in a while I'll get a &#34;dead&#34; string. I'll just call the customer service number and they will replace it free of charge. Same thing with strings that break while tuning them up.
745,798,4.0,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze, Martins Lifespan SP, Dr, D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze, and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all, smooth on my fingers. Second, Elixir Phospher bronze, last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
479,798,4.0,"I always go with Elixirs. Great, long-lasting sound! I would recommend these to anyone, both experienced players and amateurs alike."
248,798,3.0,"These are perfect. Hard to beat strings. They last, keep in tune, and keep their tone. They don't need any string cleaners either. So you can save money on that. An obvious noticeable difference between the Medium gauge and the Light is that these Medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger-pick a lot.  But boy.... Are they bright! Enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees!"
153,798,0.0,I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.
1099,265,4.0,These strings sound amazing. They also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing. I get better harmonics with these strings as well.
635,265,4.0,"I tend to sweat when I play, so coated strings are a necessity for me.  These are as good as any coated string on the market, I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh, and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.  The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it."
236,265,3.0,These do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings.  I like them.
1375,265,2.0,sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings
638,265,3.0,These strings have great tone and feel.  They seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time.
846,265,2.0,"if you like this guage you'd like these.. I just tried them, just to try.. but I've confirmed I like heavier gauges."
353,379,4.0,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy, sealed looking fretboard, that doesn't have that problem, but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's, but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
319,379,4.0,"My favorite brand of strings right now. 8 guitars now are fitted. They bend easy, last longer, feel smoother and a shot of Finger Grease Spray just adds the icing to the cake"
691,379,4.0,"I haven't owned my electric guitar for over a year, but I've only replaced its strings once. I've been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new. At this rate, it seems that the current strings I have installed would last forever. Would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set."
737,379,4.0,"I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings, I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they don't break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much."
734,379,1.0,not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string.  I break high e strings on occasion.  but something as thick as an A string?? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since.  now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them.  Further more do I stick with the same brand.  that is supposed to last longer than average strings.  At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there.  I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star.  if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly
970,379,4.0,"Yes, these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics, but no more, I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do, however, seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
1306,379,4.0,"I have used Elixir's on all my guitars for the past 3 years and never been disappointed. Their tone is great and the nanoweb's feel nice when you're playing.Disclaimer, I would only recommend the nanoweb, NOT the polyweb."
1293,379,4.0,Always the best string I buy.  I like the Martin coated as well but I prefer the elixer.  This is the first set I baught for my electrics but so far so good.
711,379,1.0,"I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic, which I was pretty happy with.  For my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didn't have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings.  I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right.  I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings.  I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  Don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of D'Addario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings."
529,379,3.0,"I really like these strings, because I have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast. I can play a guitar once, and leave it there for 2-3 weeks, and the strings will be rusty and nasty when I return to it. I now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them, but this stil happens.Then I happened across these Elixir nanowebs. They are great. I no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly, and they stay rust and gunk-free for 2+ weeks (of regular playing). However, I did encounter one strange thing. While playing at a rehearsal, my E-string just popped and broke, hurting my finger a bit. I was surprised, because outwardly the string didn't look that bad.So that is the downside. With regular strings, you can tell the string is near the end of its life b/c it looks really bad. With these, they may still look okay but be close to breaking. Made me a little cautious.I still prefer these 100% over other strings, though."
322,379,4.0,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled, the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very, very smooth to play and the sound is amazing, I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric, and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat, mellow, sweet sound."
1374,379,4.0,"These are the best strings ever.  I've tried almost every string on the market, and these are by far my favorite.  They sound great and last forever.  Believe the hype...they really DO last FAR longer than any other strings, and they sound great while doing it.Many other strings will sound great for a short while, but as soon as they get ""gunked up"", they lose any brilliance and tone, and become dead sounding.  Not these.  They will sound great for the life of the string.  In fact, the only way I know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good (which they don't), but because I'll start having intonation problems and I know the strings need to be changed.  Normal wear and tear does that, but these strings last SO long.I've tried the polyweb strings from Elixir as well, but I didn't like those at all.  To me, they didn't FEEL right.  Sticky or something (not like your fingers stick to the strings, but like you could tell they were coated).  With the Nanowebs, they sound AND feel like regular strings, but last forever.  The only string I'll use."
917,379,2.0,Pricey as far as strings go.  A lot of people swear by them but I get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less.
319,394,3.0,Elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my Guitars. They are smooth and bending is a breeze. They last longer than most other brands I've used. I use a little Finger Grease Spray and I would recommend them to anyone.
1367,394,4.0,"I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic, so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands).  They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction--it's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings--these feel like super-flatwound strings, meaning they feel smooth.  I have some nice callusses built up, but I imagine that I'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out (or restarting) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non-coated strings."
140,394,4.0,"I put these on one of my Gibson Les Pauls' and so far so good.  Great sound and no wear after one session, unlike the D'Addario strings.I will update in a few weeks as I see how long they last."
42,394,3.0,"Good strings for my electric guitar.I liked the product a lotClean sound, easy to change and much more."
805,394,4.0,Bought these for my son's electric guitar.  He loves this brand!  They sound great and seem to last longer than other brands.  Price is great!
181,394,4.0,"Been using these for years. They feel great, last longer than any other string and most importantly, they sound GREAT.They cost a little more than other strings but they're worth it."
237,394,4.0,"Totally awesome strings. I've heard other strings are great too, but I highly recommend everyone try these if you haven't. Outstanding string life, superior sound, ease of sliding, I get these strings every time. Elixirs for life! I'd pay double for these strings all day."
1306,394,4.0,"As a professional guitar player, I am always nervous playing a show with &#34;old&#34; strings. However, I've been using Elixir for over 2 years now, and the strings really do last a long time. I would usually replace my strings every month, but I've started leaving them on for up to 6 months."
1246,394,4.0,These guitar strings are very nice and I love them. I always buy this brand. They work well and sound amazing.
1329,394,2.0,"After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that ""sound good three times longer"" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, ""Which one will go today?"" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a ""bad set"", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all.]"
488,394,4.0,great set of strings I will stick with elixir strings whether it be electric or acoustic great brand and they know what they are doing.
1186,564,3.0,"Sound great, last much longer than any other string I have tried.Worth the extra $$. Give them a try."
1005,564,4.0,"These strings sound great, play great, and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings, and it does take a micron off the treble, but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar, and play rock, folk, and country strumming. They rock, and I feel they are the best strings around today, period.  These strings are very small, and are great for playing for long periods of time, without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording, and you probably have less of a bass boom, but I like 'em."
207,564,4.0,"These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time (months) unlike other guitar strings.  Great product.  These Extra Light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment, so instead I buy Elixir Nanoweb strings in singles so I can select the gauges that I like even better.  A great product no matter what gauge string you choose."
258,564,4.0,I have written other reviews about elixir. High quality strings. Great for acoustic and electric. No complaints on these strings.
395,564,4.0,"It was time for a change after many years of using the same strings and I am really glad I tried Elixir. They feel really nice and sound awesome, I will be sticking with these now, thanks for the good and prompt service as well Cheers !!!"
1032,564,4.0,these strings sound really great and have that special nanoweb coating that is resistant to corrosion and rusting like other strings tend to get as they age.  the extra light gauge sound so bright and happy on my acoustic- which is very old and tired looking.. but sounds brand new when i throw these strings on it.  very much recommended.. acoustic and elixir electric strings as well.
834,637,4.0,"Love Elixir strings! I bought my first pack, over 7 years ago and I've been hooked. They last, at least, twice as long as traditional copper wound strings, and sound even better. GET THESE! These make my cheap $50 acoustic guitar, sound almost as good as my Martin...no kidding."
536,637,4.0,"I first discovered Elixir strings when I purchased my Taylor and I've been a convert ever since.  They cost roughly two or three times as much as uncoated strings but are well worth it.  If your hands perspire when you play, this product will keep your strings sounding new and fresh.  They sound great on my Martin too !"
805,637,4.0,"Purchased these strings after having tried Blue Steel strings on my son's acoustic guitar.  He prefers the Elixir strings over the Blue Steel strings. He says they last a lot longer and sound better, too."
1410,637,3.0,"My husband got these and they don't get dirty as quickly, which is a plus.  Initially the sounds aren't as clear as the uncoated ones, but it wears off after a couple of hours of play and you wouldn't know the difference.  He'll buy them again.  No difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind."
453,637,4.0,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs, but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string, but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic, for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat, very pleased there as well."
505,637,4.0,"What can I say, I am a string snob! Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played.I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference. The guitar has such a great ring to it.Also use these on my Taylors. These will give any quitar a beautiful voice!Pros:LifeSoundPlayabilityQuality and DurabilityCons:Price"
716,102,4.0,"WOW, is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 string.Endless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer. Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag. You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers."
555,102,4.0,These strings are great for a 12 string. I started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel. A 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have. They sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string I have used on this guitar. And I think they will last longer. Which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring!
898,307,3.0,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose, nearly stripped, when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset, but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough, and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
628,307,4.0,"Being from Tampa, I wanted my first guitar to be a Dean. Sure, there are plenty of other options out there, but I just had it in my head thats what I wanted. Well, I must say I am very happy with the purchase. Guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box, inside another Dean shipping box, which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another, larger, Amazon box. Was essentially ready to play right out of the box, with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs. One knock on it I have seen online before buying was that the tuners don't hold tight, I have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it, including some drastic bends. Checked with a steel straightedge and a light, the neck was dead flat and straight. The edges of the frets could use some more finishing, they are still a bit edgy. I have seen others mention filing them down a bit, same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory. I will probably get some diamond files and do this as well, I keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck. I'm no expert on tone, but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects I've thrown at it. I did restring mine with the DR Neon Multi-Color strings for using with Rocksmith, which required adjusting the intonation. The low E and A strings ended up at the very end of their range, and the A is actually still a tiny bit flat. This could well be a factor of those particular strings though, so I wont knock the guitar for it. As others have noted, the finish can vary drastically. Mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable. Overall, looks a nice piece, especially for the cost. I could not ask for better for this price. From what I hear from more experienced players, as I progress I could easily upgrade the tuners and pickups, though I think I will leave this one alone and just get a higher end guitar when its time.OVERALL:Nice looking, feeling guitar for a beginner.PROS:Excellent value.Good quality construction.Feels and looks good right out of the box.Can be upgraded in time if you choose.CONS:Tuners may or may not slip when playing hard.Finish is variable, be willing to accept whatever shade you get."
100,307,3.0,I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk.  Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue.It's a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup.  Action is incredible.  Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs.  The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsive.Hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point.
929,307,4.0,"I had bought one a few years ago when i was a little short on cash, I was very skeptical that this would work for me, After my guy set it up it played flawlessly to say the least, Once i got my tele back and my acoustic Gibson back, (the life of a out of work guitar player, always the pawn shops best customer) but i was able to incorporate the Dean in with both of them, And it gave me another electric to play, This cheap little Dean guitar has turned into a favorite for me, Plug it in and sit back and enjoy what comes out of it, Very crisp with no noise, So if your looking for a good cheap guitar to either learn on or just something that you can pick up and play, And i have never had anyone tell me that it sounded horrible, And it got me through some tough times, That is why i just bought another one for practice, I hope that you will be able to use this review for your decision, Bottom line you can't go wrong with this guitar.......................PEACE"
812,853,2.0,I love the idea of this but I wish I had spent more for a better quality version. I had seen them used by others and chose this one but it is not well made. The number dial is not accurate and is loose so as you are using it you have to keep checking that it has not moved. It works but I'll probably end up getting a better one.
192,853,4.0,"If you understand what this is for, I think it's a great idea. Maybe not a perfect tool but I believe it does what it is supposed to and does it well.Keeping in mind, I'm a guitar player who just bought a drum kit... My assumptions when using this are that drum tuning is &#34;relative&#34; meaning that 99% of drum pitch is established by ear, based on what you want each drum to sound like, unlike a stringed instrument which is tuned against an absolute reference frequency and each string has a distinct relation to the others.The concept with this torque key is that it assists you with applying equal tension on each of the tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all the way around the circumference of the head. It by no means will help you establish as specific pitch on any drum; it simply helps you achieve an even tension and &#8220;relative&#8221; pitch all around the head. The tension numbers on the torque key are for reference only, 2 is tighter than 1, 3 is tighter than 2... and so on. Yet these numbers are only relevant to each head; I find that you don't necessarily pick a number such as 2 and tune all the drums to that.The way I use this, right or wrong, is that I tune an approximate tune on any given head using the traditional method of tapping around the perimeter and tightening apposing rods as necessary until the pitch is the same all the way around and at an audible frequency that I like for the drum I&#8217;m tuning. Now theoretically you&#8217;re pretty well tuned anyway but this is when I grab my torque key and I set it to a number a bit lower than were I expect the torque is (this only comes from experience of using it a few times) then I check a tension rod and I increase the setting on the torque key until it no longer &#34;breaks over&#34;. Now, whatever number I'm on is the reference number for that drum. My process from here is to move around the head in the same crisscross pattern as you would tuning traditionally but I loosen each rod a bit first and then bring it back up to torque with the torque key. After this process, my drum head should both be at a pitch that I have chosen by ear and have equal pitch all around the drum head.I believe it is a common practice to use a slightly different tension on the bottom side head ether a little tighter or looser than the top side (typically a little lower pitch on the bottom?). Once you&#8217;ve tuned the top head, and you know what number you&#8217;ve used you can quickly tune the bottom by reducing or increasing a click or two on your torque key.Sure there are a few other variable that can come in to play like, did you seat the head adequately when installing it which in essence means did you apply some light pressure to the center of the head while drawing down the tension rods in small equal amounts in a crisscross pattern. Also, how are the rims of your shells, are they well machined and smooth? These may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work. How about your tension rods, are the threads clean, are they lubricated? Any variability in resistance of the threads on your torque rods will directly translate to pitch in that location. Again, I'm just a rookie and I may be off with some of these assumptions or they may have an essentially unmeasurable impact so take it for what it's worth.Once you find a tuning you like, you could write down what number it took to achieve the pitch you like on each head, that would make it easy to quickly get back to the same pitch if/when your drums need to be tuned again."
960,853,2.0,"i would use this again, the plastic around the ball scraped away and the ball flew out making it useless"
709,853,4.0,"I purchased this key on a whim.  When it arrived the instructions were not clear, but I sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning. Too loose and deep, so I increased the setting to #3 and repeated.  Almost the sound I wanted, so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern.  Perfect.  I then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest.  Using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 1/2 octave apart.Next I worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side. I used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound I wanted. The bass drum came next - I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning. From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attained.This is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two. When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting.  Test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want. Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set.I'll never go back to tuning by ear!  You'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key, and don't forget to write down your optimum settings."
586,742,4.0,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series, which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1,2,or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
1383,742,2.0,"This switch does work, but you should look before you leap. The switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3-way switch, and if you use the common Fender replacement control plate (or one that was only intended for a 3-way switch, it may not fit. You could fairly easily alter the plate, but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate."
593,742,3.0,"Recently, I was building a Telecaster project.  A friend recommended using the 4 way switch instead of the stock 3 way switch.  This allows you to have the three positions normally found on a Telecaster,  bridge only,  bridge + neck in parallel, and neck only.  It also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in series.The result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge + neck position and  a slightly higher top end output.  This is clearly a case of &#34;your mileage may vary.&#34;  I've been used to the traditional 3-position switch on my other Telecasters.  I'm a bit indifferent to this mod.  If I was building another guitar, I would probably use this switch again.  It does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the 3-way.  However, I would not change out a working 3-way switch for this.  For me, the added benefit just isn't worth the effort."
639,742,2.0,"The four-way diagram that comes with the switch does not tell you which side to use. Both sides have five tabs and look the same from the above diagram given no matter which way you turn it. I figured it would go the same way as the three-way - wrong. You think Fender would have the sense to figure this out, and give us a proper diagram, but guess again. Just another example of the incompetence at Fender."
1071,742,4.0,Great solid switch. Works well for giving your Telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel.  As for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all I can say is that I have this in several of my Teles and I have never had a problem with the switch travel being too much for the plate.
603,82,2.0,"These are nice,and this was easily the best price around. These are made in Japan, and I believe they're made for Fender by Gotoh, so they're good quality. But I was annoyed that they ( the bushings) didn't fit the ""standard,vintage-sized"" .340"" holes in my All-parts neck ( they're a little large).So be aware of that."
1157,82,4.0,"First of all, don't expect any new tuner to work as a ""drop-in"" replacement.  Drop-in replacements for tuners basically don't exist unless you have the exact type of tuner, and in that case, you aren't doing an ""upgrade"".  You'll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer.  Or, if there's a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby, have a tech do the work for you.These tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive, with a nice vintage look.  They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele.  Unfortunately, my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock, which meant that the low E string's tuner was too large - the wing for the screw hung over the edge.  Therefore, I will not be installing these on my guitar, but that is not the fault of the tuner.Functionally, these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate, and I've heard the hold tune just fine.  Check the back of your headstock for fit, but if that's a ""go"", these are a great option!"
671,82,3.0,"I didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted &#34;vintage&#34; for my &#34;relic'd&#34; build. Clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on Amazon. But no worries, Amazon sells adapters to make the &#34;large&#34; holes in the neck fit the &#34;smaller&#34; vintage tuning key posts.1 star off for not looking like the higest quality. I'm happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price."
291,194,4.0,Another easy modification for my Indonesian Telecaster Squier. Better looks and function. Tuning is easier and holds longer than with stock sheet metal guides.
140,194,4.0,I am upgrading my Chinese Fender Strat with American Hardware.  I own an American Strat too and plan on making the best of the Chinese one.  Going to upgrade electronics and everything else too.These are exactly what's on my American Strat5 stars
1191,194,4.0,"Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on.  They work perfect and look good.  You get 2 in package (with screws) so I have a spare.Update I only had one on E/B but went ahead and added one for G/D.  Works and look great!!!  google ""stratocaster string tree placement"" if you are unsure of where and how to install."
861,194,4.0,"They upgraded my 72 Tele Deluxe, they fit perfectly yet you have to push really hard on the finish at the headstock for it to go in without opening any holes on the wood."
651,194,3.0,Used on an old tiesco 3/4 size guitar i refurbished for one of my grandsons. Guitar tuned easy and holds tune well. He plays it for hours at a time
1183,194,3.0,"Not a drop in replacment for many Fenders. I installed these on a Fender Marauder and needed to drill holes in the head stock. You can't see it really well in the picture but there is a metal plug on the bottom next to the screw hole that needs a hole to fit into.I sweat some bullets and used the smallest drill bit I own, and stuck a piece of tape 1mm from the tip so I wouldn't drill too deep. It is important to make the hole STRAIGHT in line from the screw hole so they don't go on crooked. I also had to drill the screw holes about 2mm deeper because the screws that come with this go deeper into the headstock.Now that they're installed I can attest that the guitar holds it's tune better and it's easier to tune. Before it would not respond for many pegs until twisted too far then it would suddenly break lose and be too sharp/flat. That happens far less now."
1405,194,4.0,"definitely recommend these over any other string trees. I used both, one for DG and BE, required some minor drilling so I had a guitar tech do it for me just to be safe..."
321,194,2.0,I'm using the guides to replace factory guides on my Strat and Tele. They will require that I drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly. I hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done.  The quality of these guides is not what I expected. They are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them. If you want a very clean looking finish I would look for a higher quality guide. At this point I'm not even sure that I will use them.
200,194,2.0,"Meh, these things are what they are. They didn't solve any problems or make anything better.  Oh well, sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason."
753,194,2.0,I had a hard time lineing them up to install .the little knob on them made it very hard to install.so good luck ..
1197,194,3.0,"These work much better than standard stamped trees. No problem with Ernie Ball strings going out of tune quickly.I did notice in Guitar Center, some of those spendy &#34;American Strats&#34; have the cheap stamped out trees, and non-locking tuners."
1201,194,3.0,"If you are replacing your old butterfly trees, you can use the same holesclip and sand off the alignment pins, as they are not really needed, and justadd another hole to your headstock.Good trees for the price."
190,194,3.0,Arrived quick. These are good replacements or upgrades. Work much better then the other style of string trees.  I would recommend this.
838,194,3.0,String trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments. Just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts.
83,194,4.0,I put this in my Fender MIM Stratocaster. I want to change that &#34;poor&#34; string guides that came in MIM by the American Series string guide. So nice...
510,165,3.0,I works as advertised.  What can I say?  It's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to.  Just buy it and move on.
1221,165,4.0,"I may be a guitar newbie, but as far as I can tell - this capo is not a fake-o piece of crapo!"
1,165,3.0,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily,comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside, seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
1008,165,4.0,I used it to hold down the strings on my bass while I adjusted the truss rod. Worked perfectly for that purpose.
688,165,1.0,"Did not hold the strings down very well for me... I love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power."
246,165,4.0,"Very Well finished, everything except rubber, is made of aluminum, with little bit of metal i guessnot like other reviewer said, it fits in your hand comfortable, does not need lot of strength to openit may, be hard for old man, or kidalso, rubber doesnt smell that bad!, i mean it does but its not seriousthey also used glue to stick rubber"
15,165,3.0,I use this primarily when setting up guitar and measuring strings by locking down on 1st fret and taking measurements from there.
271,165,4.0,I was impressed by the quality of this product. It is simple and does its job well. Easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or Les Paul or with a thin neck on most metal Guitars. Holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise. Was a great value.
850,165,4.0,"I love these Dunlop capos.  They are quick to put on, grip nicely, and above all they don't get in the way of your hand.  I bought 5 of them from Amazon because they were such a good price."
556,165,3.0,Wasn't expecting much for this price. But I was surprised. Have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems. Workmanship seems good. Does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product. I also have a more expensive Capo just like this one. They look as though they come from the same factory. More expensive is not always better.
96,165,3.0,great stuff to have for a great price&#8230;i like it! highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar.
1357,165,4.0,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality, I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years, which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them, they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty, it cleans easily."
1174,165,4.0,"I have a guitar and several ukes of all sizes. This works very well for all of them. It's very easy to take on and off, and it stays right where you put it. The rubber is tough but molds to the instrument, I haven't seen and marks or damage from using it."
1388,165,3.0,"I used to use a Schubb Capo, but started using the Dunlop Trigger a few years ago and never looked back. The fit can be a little tight, especially higher up on the fretboard, but I personally like this, mostly for the fact there are less moving parts (compared to a Schubb) and the fit is nice and secure."
642,165,3.0,"Works as described.  For the price I have no complaints at all. Clamps firmly and easily, doesn't move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic."
140,165,4.0,"This Capo is inexpensive and works well.  Clips on easily and hold strings down nicely.  What more can I say.  Gotta keep it simple on this review because it's a simple item.  Simply, it does what it's supposed to do for a low price.  I think it will last a while too but I'll probable misplace it before it breaks anyway so I have a few of these floating around.  You should have one of these in each gig bag."
805,165,4.0,I purchased this for my son to use on his acoustic guitar.  I had previously purchased a fabric capo for him to use until I could get him a better one.  That did not last long. I ordered this one and he loves it.  It's durable and works perfectly.
1279,165,3.0,"The only negative to this well made capo is I wish the tension was slightly less.  I find that once placed, notes played closer to it are slightly sharp even using light pressure.  It will work out just fine though and I will just have to make a few adjustments in tuning to correct for this."
210,165,4.0,"I haven't used it a lot yet, but I really like it so far.. Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using, and it works for my guitars and my banjo, without putting them out of tune. It seems to be solidly made as well, and not too much pressure as others said.. My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :P, and was much heavier. I'd assume it was made out of Cast-Iron or something instead of Aluminum."
251,165,2.0,"Be careful about using capos like this, because if you're using a fine guitar, it may damage the finish.  Try it, and double check regularly, and I wouldn't leave it clamped on the guitar, overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand."
471,165,4.0,This is a fine product. Any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it. Looks great on the guitar and works really well. Recomended.
591,165,4.0,"How you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar you're using it on... What works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another... I can say with confidence that this capo works flawlessly on an American Standard Strat... Fits great, easy on/off, easy adjustments. The padding on the capo is such that you would really have to go out of your way to mar the finish on your neck with it... All relevant areas of the capo are well padded. It seems very well constructed, after two weeks of heavy use, I don't see why it wouldn't last for years."
970,165,4.0,"I was using a Kyser capo, until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn't hold all the strings down.  I thought I'd try something else out and settled on this one.  It's easy to take on and off. It's tight enough.  The main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so I think it will fit even the widest fretboards.  I don't know about a 7 or 8 string though."
1133,165,4.0,"This capo is small, looks good, and works very well.  It is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar."
185,165,4.0,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great, but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people, but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
335,165,4.0,It's nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play. A lot of songs say capo preferred. It helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on. I recommend this product.
949,165,2.0,this is not the greatest product they make - but it works quickly and makes the 12 string spread when needed to do so more easily than most.
1098,165,3.0,"I am a beginner guitarist, I am happy with this capo. It works good and that is all I need. The fit and finish seems like quality also."
1180,165,3.0,"I've had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos.  What the hell.  Anyway, this capo works well.  I've only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics, and it does a fine job.  Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off, but it does not affect the capo-abilities.  I'm sure there are better ones, but for me, this works well."
1228,165,2.0,I was not a fan of this particular capo. It was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style.
211,165,4.0,"Simple, strong but easy to apply, comes in a variety of colors.  Haven't used it a great deal, but it seems to be great and non-damaging to the finish on the guitar.  The handle sticks out farther than a simple elastic strap capo, but this is a good choice at a great price."
1160,165,4.0,"You know when a good quality item arrives, everything looks and works just as it is intended.  I love it ..."
329,165,4.0,"I have two of these. High quality build. Out of personal preference...this capo design works best for me. Tension is perfect for my Washburns. One has light strings & the other has medium. I thought this was worth mentioning since the diameter of the strings might affect the clamping tension. Both of them sound like there was no capo on. Overall, I'm happy with this brand. Highly recommended."
982,165,4.0,"I have a Electric Bass Guitar and needed to Capo. After looking at &#34;reviews&#34; I like this one the best. I'm very happy with it and it works great without any problems. The size is &#34;Just Right&#34;, not too small or Big ..."
687,165,4.0,"It's a little harder to open than other capos I've used, but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it. It's not cheap and flimsy, though! I don't see this one wearing down anytime soon! Now stop reading this review and buy this capo! You wont regret it!"
605,165,0.0,"This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos.  I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me."
1152,165,3.0,"A quality, low-cost capo that is so easy to use that does a perfect job and claps on the guitar strap out of the way when not in use"
637,165,4.0,"This Capo is solid and well made. I use it on my seagull acoustic, and Fender Stratocaster. No problems at all."
183,165,4.0,Its nice and easy to use.  Secures the strings very good and works for all types of guitars with no issues.
1278,165,4.0,"Does what it is supposed to do. It is pretty good quality and durable too. Quick, simple and efficient.  I would definitely buy again. Highly recommended."
39,165,4.0,"What a great device.  This is the first 'quick-change' capo I've owned.  I used to use those old stretchy things.  Since I play at some jams, it's important that I can change quickly and accurately.  Move it from fret to fret and the guitar stays in tune."
1390,165,4.0,"Great capo! I've tried a lot of other capos, including some pretty expensive brand name capos, and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings."
44,165,3.0,"Although it is touted for acoustic guitars, it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric. The spring is tough and it holds securely. On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it. I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and haven't had a chance to use it much. But, I like it so far. It was delivered quickly. It does the job. I'll update after I've had it for awhile."
146,165,2.0,Thought I'd try this but there's another brand that I prefer.  Needed to re-shift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some.
839,165,4.0,"I've used mine on my electric and acoustic guitars and it is easy to use, quick to reposition, frets the strings properly. It is cost effective and looks good. Nice to have a color option, not the usual black that everyone else seems to have.I need a wider one for my 52mm classic guitar's neck that is also flat. This capo cannot work with it.If I lost it, I would definitely get another just like it."
1229,165,3.0,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned, as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said, I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo, and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed, like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight, but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed, even while playing. The capo is sleek looking, and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;, but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time, and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB, Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
445,165,4.0,"Not that it's a huge deal - but I quite prefer this capo over any other capo I've used.  It just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that ""snap"" into place.I own several of these now and whenever I mis-place one (which happens too often!) I come back to purchase another.If you're looking for a capo I highly recommend using this Dunlop model."
124,165,2.0,"...but for a small woman with small hands, it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings, which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock, a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both, if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
459,165,4.0,"I've been learning for a little over a year and have had this capo for about that long . Though my playing still isn't very strong , the capo still is. I don't use it hardly at all but when I do I usually end up playing around with it quite a bit. My point being it gets tested more than the amount of times I use it. It's simply engineered of fairly heavy duty design so I don't expect any issue at anytime soon."
83,165,4.0,This acessorie is well builded and don't change the guitar's pitch. No damages guitars neck. It's so easy to use
1119,165,3.0,"Grips the neck well and keeps the strings immobile even when strumming real hard. Feels a little awkward trying to put the capo on with one hand, but I guess that's how all of them are. Works very well on acoustic guitars"
409,83,4.0,"White thin picks by fender, what else can I say? They are very good looking, the only downside with thin picks is that you tend to keep buying thin picks because they keep breaking BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING FAST AND WILD WITH THEM!"
1388,83,3.0,"I've always been a fan of these Fender Classic picks. They just feel right, wear very well, and make a nice sound in conjunction with a good set of strings on my Telecaster. I also think the price is pretty fair."
347,83,4.0,These are guitar picks and I don't play guitar so I can't say much more than the fact that they came and they were what they said they were
140,83,4.0,These picks are perfect.  They are just the right feel for medium and look awesome.  What more can you say about picks other than they are perfect.
279,83,4.0,"If you haven't used these picks, get some. They are the perfect size and shape. Your really can't beat them."
482,83,4.0,"Other picks usually let me down when I riff and melt faces playing the blues jazz or gospel etc., Fender heavies are made to make the notes sound like l they have been hit for real. I prefer no cheap imitations. Only Fender Heavies. That's what I smoke."
1185,83,2.0,"Like other reviewer wrote previously, I received less picks than advertised (I received a total of 7 picks). I don't know if the people at customs ""borrowed"" some from me, but I find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem. Other than that, the picks are good, seem to be durable and produce a nice sound."
982,83,4.0,I have a bass guitar and sometimes us a pick. Seen these and they work great when needed. Looks good too :)
1040,83,4.0,"I have used Fender Medium picks since the late 60's.  Yes, they are made in China now (!!) but they are still the same pick as far as I can tell.  The picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip-lock baggie.  All 12 were in there, all of them Fender Mediums.  (purchased from B&G; Music Associates)  Shipped from Illinois to California in 3 days with normal shipping.The picks are great and I couldn't be happier with the order. Whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where I stand.  Recommended if you want/need a nice little bag of Fender Mediums."
60,83,4.0,"This is the first guitar pick I ever played with and to this day is my favorite type.  Nice and thin and flexible, but not so flexible that you can't bend it for single picking.  I'm torn between this style, out of nostalgia, and the blue version-because I love blue."
1312,83,4.0,"Best guitar picks. Great shape, sturdy. No fancy expensive flashy grip features. Guitar pics as the God's of Rock intended."
1201,83,3.0,The Fender medium is my second choice for picks.My first is the 'Just Strings' pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer (less scrape) feel on the strings at half the price.Pick choice is like guitars and amps; everyone has a different opinion.
124,83,4.0,"Fender Medium, my favorite guitar pick, a dozen should last a while right?  When these slip away I'll order more."
372,313,3.0,"Even though the title says ""Acoustic Guitar Case"", it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo, and the reviews were good. Sure enough, the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should, and the build quality is almost perfect. However, when closing the case, a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place, then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly, and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well, at a reasonable price."
1359,313,4.0,"I am VERY satisfied with my hard shell A-style mandolin case; I received prompt delivery, it was reasonably priced, and a quality product; thanks!"
676,313,4.0,I bought this case for my Rogue A-style electric mandolin.The inside is nicely lined; the hardware is solid.It came at a great low price but it does not feel cheap.I recommend this to anyone with an A-style mandolin.jafmusicmix
940,313,3.0,Great case very well made and has great padding construction seems to be good and I have no complaints about this product!!!!!
1366,313,2.0,"I gave this 3 stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating. I have nothing to say against the product or the company, only that this is NOT a GUITAR CASE! It is a MANDOLIN case! Amazon should correct this.Stagg STB-10W  Acoustic Guitar BagEpiphone Case for Epiphone Dot, Sheraton, 335"
558,313,4.0,"I just received the case today, the soonest delivery day on the estimation range (a plus there!).  Now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet, this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case.  Nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim-threading and basic locks (keys included) are gold toned (instead of silver toned pictured), but that doesn't mean diddly-squat to me.  Plush interior with a small, yet roomy, compartment located under the neck.  I am primarily a 5-string banjo player, but decided to casually play around with the mandolin, and so I figured I had better get a hard case for possible ""long-time"" storage (my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before I started getting serious with it... and boy, not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces).  This case will definitely do the trick.  Excellent value!- Additional note, there is a bit of extra play around the peg-head (I have an Rover mandolin)... I can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough, some peg snapping may occur.  But again, for simple storage/protection, its a non-issue."
1260,535,4.0,Good quality one. I like the big size type. Would like to have a thinner one. So far so good.
923,535,4.0,"These are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks.  Thus, just a heads-up.  Having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks.  I use all types and all brands and Fender's are always predictably great quality."
372,535,3.0,"This shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick. I sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heart-shaped Fender pick. The stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string. Good for strumming rhythm, not so hot for lead."
354,535,4.0,"So glad I found these,  three sides,  much easier for me to hold,  thin is in!  As a beginner these make much more comfortable."
787,535,4.0,"Maybe a little bigger than I'm comfortable with, but my guy friends with the huge hands love these things. They keep disappearing."
170,46,4.0,pretty....seems to work fine...purchased a pack for my playing buddy...he loves fender...only way to go...will order another set soon. very happy with service
1,46,4.0,The picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package. All 12 picks were there. Saves me a trip into town therefore wear and tear on my car. They feel good in my hand while strumming the strings. Good deal and I will purchase again.
10,46,4.0,I'm working on new strumming patterns and these were exactly what I needed to 'soften' things up just a bit.
1414,46,4.0,"When I bought my first guitar about 6 months ago I just chose a pack of picks on Amazon's list of ""other buyers also bought this"" and those were these Fender 351 picks.At the time I figured all picks were created equal.Since then I've tried various sizes and brands - Dunlop, Planet Waves, etc.But I keep coming back to this Fender 351 Medium pick for both my electric and acoustic guitar.The sound it makes is nice and sharp without being too trebly.The Planet Waves picks all seem to be a little muddy-sounding.I've found a winner with these Fender picks and will definitely be ordering more."
715,46,4.0,"Ordered these guitar picks for my son. The picks were exactly as described. We ordered the blue color, which is dark blue with a lighter, shiner, blue design on top of it. It is a ""heavy duty"" grade and it is very sturdy. He is very pleased with these picks. The appearence is pleasing and it is made well - very pleased with the quality. We will be purchasing more picks in the future. Highly recommend!"
874,46,4.0,"I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picks.These picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are. I play guitar everyday for around 3-5 hours a day and I have yet to break one of these picks. Very nice quality and very cool color to them. They are also priced very good.Much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store. Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar. Additionally, they are very fast at shipping them to your door. Three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step."
73,46,4.0,"These Fender Medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well. Color and appearance is a personal thing, I think these abalone picks just look cool. The color mix is random (no two picks are exactly the same); some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them. Overall, the effect is not bad compared to real abalone.Fender makes a nice standard pick. The three weights are pretty easy to figure out (light, medium, and heavy). These mediums work well for playing electric guitar. I have some light red ones that have a lot of flex. Those work well for acoustic. I've used Dunlop with the little bumps for grip, and the Dava rubber coated picks. They are all nice, but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick. The gray Dunlop's don't look anywhere near as cool as these.At $3 for a dozen, they're worth a try. It they don't work out for playing, they sure look darn nice (the Fender logo is in gold).Dava 6024 Grip TipDunlop Nylon Standard Picks, Grey .73mm"
162,46,4.0,"I wish I could say that they let me play more like Frank Zappa, but only practice can make that happen.These are solid picks, they don't break apart, they're easy to hold, and they work exactly as a pick should work, and at a good price."
140,46,4.0,"These picks far exceed my expectations, I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest, nicest looking picks I own.  They look great, feel great and play great.  Call me a snob, but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself, buy these.I love the color and texture too, they don't slip or move around as you play."
137,46,4.0,"I almost always play finger style without a pick, but on the occasion I need a pick I like these.Easier to strum sounds good to me.If you're doing a lot of picking out individual strings, you'll probably want something thicker, but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good, plus pick out a few strings here and there."
1118,46,3.0,"I bought these as spares (and they look really cool too!). I think everyone has used Fender Mediums at some point; these are no different. Reliable, last a while and more important they're inexpensive!"
471,46,4.0,"Perfect, perfect size, weight, shape. I like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds.Recommended!"
879,46,4.0,"To everyone who plays flat-picking guitar, I'm sure you all have your own choice of pick....do you even remember why you picked the style you use!? Somehow, I started out with Fender thins and here I remain!"
35,46,4.0,"I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70's before they came out with Delrin. I like the sound and feel of these picks. They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz, and funk. They are a little expensive, but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing.I bought the abalone ones because they look cool...***UPDATE***I am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines, and usually during a performance. I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon."
1314,46,4.0,"Love these picks, pretty much the only ones I buy now, nice and flexible,great for picking, great for strumming. Recommend you try them."
1249,46,4.0,"I love these picks. Medium is the perfect size for me, as well as the majority of people. This is a great looking pic and you get 12 of them at such a great price. I wouldn't buy anything else."
822,46,4.0,Everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing- packageing and shipping. Well i bought all my picks from the music store so im rating the picks only. Ive been playing a few years and own a takamine acoustic and a fender strat. I mostly play my acoustic and use light strings so i dont need a heavy pick. I started using med fender tortose shell celluloid picks and really liked the look but as a beginner i dropped them more. My friend left a thin pick and i tried it. Since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice. The pick had a little more give so i dropped them less. Ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it. I started reading all these great reviews how the dunlop tortex was great so i ran down an bought some thins. The tip is a little more rounded. I tried them and they feel alright but the fenders were louder and brighter sounding no doubt about it. So its back to the fenders. Also something i learned is when i play a guitar that has a dark pickguard i use a light colored pick (pearloid) and a red pick for a white pickguard. The contrast helps you see what your doing. These are good picks and you have a good selection of colors instead of the dunlop that are color coded and your stuck with no choice. These are a little more slippery but you will get used to them the more you play. I dont drop em anymore. Personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass. The med is pretty stiff.
189,46,4.0,"Originally received the wrong item, but I contacted customer service and they returned my email that night (on a Sunday) and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning.  I received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks.  Great customer service, and love the pics...the color in the pictures doesn't do it justice!"
101,46,4.0,"These pics are perfect for a jazz guitarist, and I actually like the coloration too.  The Ocean Turquoise wasn't nearly as nice a color and I expected a bluish color.  These are about .7mm and that's just right."
1020,46,4.0,PERFECT picks!  very pretty and nice quality!  They are not too stiff nor are they too soft.  I would order these again!
1258,46,4.0,"Bought these picks for the impending Strat I'll buy, already have 3 sets of Fender strings, I will be ready!"
1111,46,4.0,It's a Fender Heavy so there's not much else to say about that.  Good price and selection here.  Go for it.
60,46,4.0,"I always played with the brown colored 351s growing up, but I love the blue finish on these.  I'd recommend the 351 Fender picks over any others personally but I'm very partial to blue as well, so these are perfect."
214,46,3.0,"I have played guitar for most of 40 years and have used about any type of plectrum made. I have used coins and washers at times.My favorite pick for years was a Fender heavy and then I went for the really heavy brands like Dunlop or Clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone. I went back to Fenders and then found I like the medium best.Fender makes these in the coolest colors now so I went with them. Price them at a store and you will come back here.These came from GO-DPS which is no big deal as I shop on AMZ enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time.However, I ordered a lot of stuff the day I ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house 5 days later. These didn't show up so I contacted AMZ which goes back to GO-DPS. it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks. It didn't kill me not to have them - I have a million picks, I just wanted to see these in my hand.That said, I will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors.Great price, great picks."
626,46,4.0,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick, sweep pick, tremelo pick, tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
259,46,4.0,"After all the whining I saw about these picks, was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts ""Most popular"" posters above ""Most recent"" so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition, I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
630,46,4.0,"Perfect thickness and action.What else can I say?  You won't be sorry you got these, they are all I'll get from now on."
240,46,4.0,I have found that sometimes these cheapy ones tend to break fairly easily but these ones have lasted me a very long time.  Hardly any breaks considering I get the thin ones.
915,46,4.0,I use these with Ernie Ball regular slinkies.  I find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles.  It's also cheaper.
1229,46,3.0,"I received all twelve picks, which came in a small ziploc bag with an attached Fender tag. The color is great. I needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic. These work great, though do not offer as warm a sound as rubber or felt picks. I find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber. The picks were reasonably priced and shipped via ""prime"", so I found them to be a great value as someone who only plays casually. Thanks.SPO"
114,46,4.0,These picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well. Look cool to I will buy more when the time comes
193,46,4.0,Fender 351 Picks are some of the best picks money can buy.I have used these picks for years now and I just love them.
1192,46,4.0,"I needed picks, so I ordered an assortment. I have been trying different ones. I seem to like them all."
582,46,2.0,"I wanted to experiment with a thin pick. I like the action but thinner picks tend to ""click"" over the strings and I don't care much for that. These are certainly pretty though, and the feel is typical Fender celluloid, smooth and a little slippery. Might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers. Celluloid is highly flammable, so be aware of that if you smoke (I don't)."
1202,46,4.0,"classic fender heavy picks.  i love the fender heavy pick and now my picks,knobs and inlays are all shiny abalone"
1186,558,4.0,I love being able to adjust the tension. Does not go sharp like some other capos that really clamp down.Just wish there was an easy way to keep it handy on my guitar.
382,558,4.0,"If you are familiar with Shubb's, they are by far the best capo you can get.  Some people do like the big close pin, but if you don't, buy a Shubb"
672,558,4.0,"This is the best capo I've ever owned.  It's a little awkward in that it doesn't just clip to the headstock with one hand, and it takes me two hands also to put it on, but not having to retune my 12-string makes it all worthwhile! I like the choice of colors too."
975,558,4.0,Some folk don't like these because sometimes they come off when knocked; but I like them; have few of them.They don't squeeze the strings tight and importantly; they look cool.
1271,558,3.0,"Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types, it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for, this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
1404,558,4.0,"Easily the best quality capo for it's price. Looks great on any guitar. I came across SHUBB a few months back, when my capo finally gave out after 12 years. I bought the C1 stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars, but I had to adjust it any time I went to use it on my Les Paul which has a 50s neck and fretboard.Ordered off of Amazon and it shipped the same day.I just got it in the mail yesterday, and it snapped right on the LP with a firm click. I didn't even have to adjust it. It looks amazing in use... and is just the best and simplest design.You know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what. Don't forget to remove it when you guitar is resting. It's easy to forget it's there. Forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos... this never effects my fret thumb or forefinger--exactly what I was looking for in a capo.I will have these 2 for a long time, and I'm a Shubb guy from this day forward."
694,1,4.0,"For those of you going for the folk singer look, or if you're afraid of drilling holes in your guitar, this is definitely the thing to buy to strap your guitar."
1413,1,4.0,I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close.
592,1,4.0,Quick delivery and item is good quality of genuine leather. Does exactly what it's says it is a good  piece of kit for a very good price.
1250,1,2.0,I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle.
1121,1,4.0,"Simple product, easy to use that works exactly as it's supposed to without costing too much. I got one for a banjo, Ubass & mandolin but of course you can use this on anything."
1307,593,0.0,"I bought this hoping to use as intended, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad!"
1191,593,0.0,Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.
269,593,4.0,Plenty of cord to move around with.  Makes it less likely that I am going to clip the cord on a down stroke.  Just what the guitar doctor ordered.
730,593,4.0,excellent
149,593,4.0,"I love this cable, they look good and are well made too. An incre&iacute;ble guitar cable, i really recomended it, i have the 12ft and this one 21ft. Try one."
13,55,4.0,"So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Guitar sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!"
997,55,4.0,"These aren't my first set, I can't count the amount of Monster 1/4 cables I bought and own. None has ever failed me so far. Highly recommend these! I love how they sound and they are built well."
820,55,4.0,Don't buy cheap cables. They just rob your tone. These are the best cables for the money. sure you'll spend a few more bucks but they sound great hold up and are guaranteed for life.  What else could you ask for. All I will use are these cables
73,55,4.0,"The biggest question I ask about these cables, are they worth the premium charged above more normal cables? The key to me is the lower end 100 series Monster cables,Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable (12 Feet). The answer is mixed, and depends on what you are looking for.The cable ends are very heavy, they are metal and do unscrew. In some ways this is probably good, they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging. The jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime. On the other hand, the series 100 plugs are a molded plastic end, with a good bit of flex to them, and they are lighter weight. So the choice is, heavy, shiny gold; or light weight, gray/black? For me, I like the heft of these cables.Construction-wise these are likely lifetime cables. Check out the pictures I've posted. The metal housing screws into the jack. There is an O-ring to seal the top portion of the threads. Inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack, and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic. Unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war, the wire is never separating from the jack. I don't think the actual 1/4 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks.Sound is excellent. They are clear clean cables. Are they better than the 100's? Oh maybe a tiny bit. Maybe a little clearer, cleaner sound. But it isn't a huge difference.Bottom line, for gigging, probably go with the 100's. The jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace. For practice or in your house, these are probably the way to go. They do look particularly good plugged into a Marshall half stack.These cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else Monster Cable. Study different one quarter inch jack cables and you'll see these are priced very close to everyone else. This is not the case of the HDMI cables at the big box store for fifty times what you should pay for them."
411,55,2.0,"These cables work very well at transmitting sound. So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack). Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use, and at that price, Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand name plugs, as well."
691,406,4.0,"The last thing I would think to upgrade to improve the quality of my music is the cable. I did not know that these cables actually made a difference. My guitar sounds cleaner when I use this cable versus another generic cable that I've had for a while. It was a pleasant surprise. I also heard about the wonderful warranty that Monster has. The cable has so many good things going for it, I now know what to buy the next time I need one."
317,406,4.0,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable, but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable, played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then, I turned the amp off, unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next,  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
15,406,4.0,"You should find another review from me, but suffice it to say I just won't skimp on my cables when I spend 1000's on amps and cabinets for good sound."
930,406,4.0,It's hard to beat the quality of Monster Cables!There is absolutely No discernible loss of tone through this cable - I Love It!
310,254,3.0,"Nice cables.  So far I've not had any problems with them, but haven't put them through a lot of use just yet.  Also have the Planet Waves Custom Series cables that work just as well for less money!  I'll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other."
348,254,4.0,"This cable is extra heavy, not like the cheaper ones.  The plugs are of excellent quality also.  The sound that transfers through this cable is REMARKABLY IMPROVED over my old cable.  I urge you to purchase if you are looking...you won't be disappointed. BTW, I am a verified purchaser, just can't say enough good about this cable...I'm really impressed!"
1193,254,4.0,"Monster Cable is one of the things on earth we can count on!Seriously speaking all my cables are Monsters, yes they are pricy and sometimes very much, true.But they last really lifetime and I never ever had to complain or heard a friend complaining on Monster products.PEACE"
350,254,4.0,I should've just got this cable the first time. I have been using Monster for years. I recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way.
574,254,4.0,"I bought this Monster cable (12 feet, angled) and plugged it into my Create Amp.  WOW.  Clear and no static.  I can also wrap this monster up easily because it is not stiff, but very plyable.  Heavy duty and rugged, it should last forever.  Thinking about buying another one.  Great stuff."
625,369,4.0,"It is a great option, if not simply the best. Monster knows it all in quality. Gob bless monster everyway"
997,369,4.0,These cables are sturdy and sound clean. Using cheaply made cables could affect your sound - you can loose top end. I use Monster on all my mics (XLR) and all my instrument cables (1/4) with no issues. Great product... Highly recommended.
440,369,4.0,"Quality is there in construction and signal passing.  We never have problems with our Monster gold cables.  Conversely, we have other cables crap out on us periodically."
769,369,4.0,"For me thia is the best cables ever.. i mean they give the original and natural tone of ur instrument, doesnt lose signal strenth and a very important thing, they do help to avoid most noise.. :)"
180,369,4.0,"Hands down the best cables for electric guitar. Ive tried other brands that cost almost, if not similar to these and none can match in the quality that prolink presents. These are not only the best in delivering tone but they're durable. I bought mine back in 2004 and they're still working as well as the day I got them today on September of 2012. I bought some planetwaves cables for $40 that didn't even last me 2 years."
1150,369,4.0,I would def recommend this to anyone but for electric only. If you are going to be playing acoustic I would get their specific acoustic cable. This is a very heavy guage. Sounds great!
1304,369,4.0,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely, but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me, the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality, but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
516,369,3.0,"This is definitely a high quality cable. However, my experience with this model and the less expensiveMonster Standard 100 Instrument Cable 21 ft. - straight 1/4 plugs S100-I-21model has shown me that the only difference is one is ""prettier"" with its gold colored, bling fittings. Sonically I found them to be the same - or to my ears anyway.As you can see by the tag above this review Amazon has verified that I purchased this cable (as well as Amazon verifying my purchase of the less pricey model on my review on that product page.)I initially purchased a pair of these cables for my keyboards because I had invested a significant sum into those instruments and wanted nothing but the best cables. I purchased the standard cables for some low end instruments including an old Squier Jazz Bass and a new, but very inexpensiveEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburst, neither of which to my mind warranted top of the line cables.Much to my surprise, when I started testing each cable on each instrument (all through the same amp to keep things equal), I could not discern any sonic difference between both Monster cable models. Same manufacturer, but different models. To be sure, this more expensive model looked ""cooler"", but when it came to sound - no discernible difference (that I could detect anyway.)  More perplexing is the molded stress relief ends on the less expensive model seem to make that one more reliable!My recommendation is test both this one and the standard model side-by-side before plunking down extra money for no added value beyond looks (which, I have to admit, may be a selling point on stage for some folks - no shame as long as you know what you are paying extra for and why.)"
473,369,4.0,Very well made.  No problems.  Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse.
1054,210,4.0,"I don't know what I would do without this little shelf on my music stand.  I works on my non-Manhasset sold-shelf stand, holds my pencil/highlighter/flute swab & even occasionally a small speaker set that I have for my phone.  It easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure.  Very well worth the $$."
544,210,3.0,"The plastic is pretty lightweight, but it is a big help.  I keep various guitar picks, clips, pencils, etc. on it which kept falling off when I just set them in front of the music.  Glad I bought it."
281,210,2.0,"I am using it with a Musician's Gear music stand.  The shelf fits, but moves easily when moving stuff on the shelf of the stand.  It is made out of plastic which flexes fairly easily and doesn't feel as sturdy as the metal shelf of the stand.  There aren't any other options though unless you know some one who can do metal fabrication. It is a good thing it does not cost a lot."
441,210,4.0,"This shelf is so convenient and so often used that you would think that it should come on every music stand. It just slips on to the lower shelf and creates a smaller shelf for pencils, pens, clip on tuners, capos, etc. It pays dividens in not cluttering up your book shelf so that items go spilling to the floor every time you adjust a book or turn a page. I love how a pen, capo, or tuner clipped to the top lip of the shelf serve to keep pages firmly in place until your book is &#34;trained&#34; to stay in place. A must have, five star item."
978,210,3.0,"Piece of plastic with no bracing. Due to design, will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf (which is most quality stands). I used double-sided sticky tape -- problem solved. Gives me a place to stow my guitar picks, tuner, capo and pencil and as such, is an invaluable accessory. Worth the 6 bucks, just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand!"
226,542,4.0,This acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever. It has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. It's a very good investment if you play guitar but don't have an electric acoustic. I don't think I'll ever even buy an electric acoustic now since I have this thing. Prolly sounds better anyway!!
546,542,4.0,I bought this for my daughters acoustic guitar so she could play through an amp. It fits very well and sounds great!
949,542,3.0,"quiet, almost hum free - clear respose - no volume control doesn't befront me because i use it to record & to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control. It tends to be bass heavy, but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that. I had used one in the past, this is a more solid unit & fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar & also in two others i use here and there. great job. great value. got herre quick in a nice little carry bag & I will update if problems come later - don't see why or how tho"
283,542,0.0,Could not get to fit small sound hole. Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. Would not buy it.
242,542,4.0,"I've owned a Seymour Duncan Woody for several months now, and have had a chance to try it out with various amps, with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end, and so on.  This is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as you're likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup.  The one thing I've found is that I get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the Woody through my Ampeg bass amp than through my Peavey guitar amp.  The high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and there's a tendency for distortion to creep in, even with the clean setting.  Through the bass amp, though, the tone is absolutely clean and clear.  The pickup is easy enough to install and remove and it's easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesn't interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would.  The other great feature of this pickup is the look; the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar.  If you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup, this is the one to buy!"
122,542,3.0,"The pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me. How the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable? Anyway, the pickup sounds very nice and i'm happy."
1205,542,3.0,"This is an excellent-sounding pickup.  I've had it for about six years.  Good sound throughout the spectrum - full lows and bright highs, without too much emphasis on either.  At the price it sells for, I consider it a bargain.The drawbacks:1) You need to be pay attention when installing and removing - you can damage the sound hole on your guitar if you're not careful.2) No volume control.If you're looking to occasionally amplify an acoustic guitar, this is a great, cost-effective way to go."
164,542,4.0,I've used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price. And if you've got a variety of acoustics and don't want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution. It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if you're not careful.Remember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something (most likely a tuner) with stomp on/off bypass so that you can turn it off more easily.
80,542,3.0,"Easy to use. No metallic hiss you'd normally expect. The only real drawback is the lack of presence when it comes to the bassier strings. It takes some skill to EQ things to the point of normalcy. If you're uncomfortable dealing with EQ, this might not be your best bet. Otherwise, a wonderful product at a great price."
227,587,4.0,"I've used D'Addario strings for many, many years without problems - both acoustic & electric.  I've tried these coated strings in the past, and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated, rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string, like on Elixirs.Do they last longer?  Probably.  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months, just because I don't see the need.  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode.  But these sound great and feel fine, and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found.  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great."
1337,587,4.0,"But unless you are new to guitar, you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really, I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great, and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future, I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal, if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
1254,587,3.0,"Good strings, though in 1 use I didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard Diaddario phosphor bronze strings."
782,587,3.0,this are probably the best sounding guitar strings without breaking the bank.  I have made them last up to 2 months...still obtaining decent sound.
195,587,4.0,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on, sound bright, and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever, you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less, that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
378,587,4.0,I have been using the EXPs for some time now on electic-acoustics and they have become my go-to string.  I find the coating to be less noticeable than on El***rs and tonal variations to be less from string to string and set-to-set.  Highly recommended.
843,587,4.0,"I've been using these strings for about eight years, and I also use them on my two Taylor's (814-CE & I use the mediums on my 710) I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there. I still use Martin strings once in awhile, but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them.Actually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylor's and right now they're all strung with EXP's. I know people want different sounds from their strings, but I find these to be bright with a great bottom on them, unlike the Elixirs which I find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end. These strings sound great with great dynamics on them. Even on my Laguna Grand Symphony (slightly larger than a Grand Concert) they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs. These on my Grand Auditorium do the same thing, they produce the sound I demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings I've used.The Mediums on my 710 have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mid's and treble.As I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings once in awhile, but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great. Darn near as near to an uncoated string that you're going to find."
511,587,3.0,"These D'Addario ""EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light"" strings for acoustic guitars produce decent sound and are designed to last longer than ""normal"" strings. We have two beginner guitar players in the house and we are very hard on strings, so these are a good choice for us.We are very pleased with the way they sound, feel, and last, so will likely pick up these again the next time we need to replace the strings.Recommended!CFH"
73,587,4.0,"Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar. D'Addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the Elixir's.These are very nice bright strings. The coating is incredibly subtle, almost impossible to feel on the strings. I like that. Compared to Elixir's these are a bit brighter, with good feel.Call me old school, I hate the packaging. These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag. Ah, you know I'm just so used to strings that are individually looped. Two strings looped together makes a mess while I'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair, I've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench. The neat freak in me hates that. I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag. Yeah I get it; they are trying to be more environmentally responsible. But darn it, 6 paper envelopes? It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials, not some environmental cause. 100% post-consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load.I know D'Addario loves the color coded ends. On my acoustic guitar that's irrelevant, the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs. On my electric guitars, I don't like the look at all. I prefer gold or silver rings at the end. If the strings are in individual labeled packages, there's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much, they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging. I have yet to decode their colors or naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar. I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them. The slightly thicker string is not bad.Oddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixir's. My reason for using the original D'Addario strings is low price - if somebody is doing gigs nightly, those uncoated strings are the only way to go. Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician. For the home enthusiast, coated strings make a ton of sense, they do last longer. I think they are worth the premium price. Now there are two choices for excellent coated strings.In the end, the packaging, the color coded end rings, the crazy package coding, and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar. What they sound like and play like is the most important thing. And in that regard these are excellent strings."
1177,587,4.0,Play very mello. easy on my fingers too.  Can't come close to understanding the differences of all the different style strings but these work great on My Taylor acoustic
133,587,4.0,"I am an acoustic guitar addict. With five six-string and one-twelve, I play every day and, in a year's time, I go through a lot of strings. Over the years, I have come to favor the phosphor-bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument. For a long time, I believed that brands of them were interchangeable so I bought whatever was available at the best price. No more. These D'Addarios are the sweetest, easiest to play and, not that this is the most important variable to me - the longest lasting - of any of the phosphor bronze strings I have used.There is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened Martins, Gibsons, GHS, Adamas and Elixirs (as well as other varieties of D'Addario strings.) I think it's time to sell them off. These EXP16s are superior to them all.I have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong. To play as well as I am able, I require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up. Sound-wise, I look for a blend of 'brightness' and 'warmth' on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar. These D'Addarios do both things and do them well.Other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the 'slickness' of these strings - I simple did not experience that at all. As with ALL guitar strings, they should be wiped with a dry, lint-free cloth after each and every playing. Not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of ANY string. As a bonus, the price of these strings is quite reasonable. I bought 6 sets and plan to use them all, both Mediums and Lights, for my stringed friends."
148,587,4.0,"The benefit of coated strings is, as the box says, longer life.  This is due to your natural finger oils not corroding the strings and sapping them of their natural ""life"", i.e. that brightness that new strings have.  The drawbacks to coated strings is that they can feel unnatural or slippery depending on the coating - they are also the latest rage in guitar strings and allow string manufacturers to charge more than basic commodity strings.So are these any good?  Yes, they feel great, not overly slippery or coated, and sound great, though they appear to have a more muted tone than some strings.  I'm excited to have them on my acoustic because as a mostly electric player I change my acoustic string less and am hoping that the coating will fight the grime that build on them and allow me to enjoy them longer.About gauge.  These light strings go from .012 to .053 as compared to my old Martin's which went from 0.012 to 0.054.In summary, D'addario makes good strings and these are no exception. If you're looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted (as opposed to aggresive) tone with lighter low E, then you should check these out."
1051,587,3.0,"I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re-work (I just plain wore them out), and they came back to me with these strings on them.  As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them, I immediately called the factory and said ""thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars, and by the way, these are the best sounding strings I've ever played, what exactly are they?""  I might experiment with the EXP15s, but by and large, these EXPs are my new strings."
1041,587,4.0,"I love this company. D'addario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time. Ever since I switched to this brand of strings, they seem to last longer and make a grab tone. I don't know if it's my guitar (Taylor 214CE) or the strings, but I can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar."
472,587,4.0,"I tried the EXPs on my Gibson L4 archtop because I play jazz single lines, small chord comping, and full chords more than I do on a Martin OM-1 and figured I'd get a better overall feel for tone and response.For years I've played Martin Phosphor Bronze mediums on both guitars and that's my reference: The D'Addario EXP lights show their difference mostly on the bass end where they're a good 7 mm thinner. The high E and B are 3 mm less and I can feel it but not enough to bother me. All things being equal I prefer heavier strings for tone but I play instruments I don't trust with truly heavy gauges.The first thing I noticed is considerably less ""new string clang"" compared to both the Martins and D'Addario's regular phosphur bronze strings which I've used in the past and still use for mandolin.While still a long way from sounding broken-in, the EXP strings sound as though they've had several days of good use. As a kid I perspired much more and would just rot strings like you wouldn't believe - on a humid summer day I could get rid of that clang in a hour.The tension on the EXP's feels very comfortable and considerably more flexible than the 7 mm difference should account for. I like to bend strings on acoustic in certain contexts, which can be tough with tight strings; the EXP's feel very easy - not electric guitar easy mind you, but fine for acoustic.The other quality that's noticeable is sustain. The strings I took off weren't completely dead and I wasn't expecting a dramatic difference, but it's noticable across the board, especially on small chord comping on three or four strings at a time.The tone also feels a bit more balanced across all six strings, but this is admittedly very subjective: I play with differently shaped and thicknessed picks for different recording contexts; some generate more percussive pick noise than others; sometimes I want it, other times no. The response of the EXPs sounds very consistent to my ears.I've had them on for a couple of weeks now, playing fairly regularly. Some of the initial clang is gone but the (desired) bright lively tone has not degraded noticeably.I suppose the real test of the EXP coating is how they sound beyond the point where other strings begin to sound dead. Maybe I'll update this review down the line, but for me, it's a false question because if the strings don't sound and feel good in the short term, who cares if they last forever!"
269,587,4.0,"I love these customs...inbetween the lights and mediums...you get the bright booming sound...nice bends and of course, the longer playing life...I've used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in them...to brigthen the sound a tad.  I would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye."
971,587,3.0,These strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive. the tone is clear and bright. I have used D'Addario for years
1228,587,4.0,Personally I just love the D'Addario strings. They sute my needs just right for the Takamine acoustic. Great quality and price.
822,587,2.0,"Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze. The EXPs are nice strings. They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise. And they last. My two acoustic  guitars, a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo, both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars. I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone. And since my guitars have alot of ""boom"" already, i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast. I imagine these strings may work in some instances, but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars."
4,587,2.0,I like Elixir.  I had to try this one because of another friend said it's ok and cheaper.I tried it and the quality is low end.The sound is not as crisp.The gauge is too heavy for my fingers (not their problem)All 6 strings are wrapped inside one single bag.I'd go back to Elixir next time.
1123,587,4.0,"We have an old acoustic around the house, but I rarely play it, opting instead for the electric. This is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.When we put these new strings on the guitar (Lotus), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible--bright and clear.These are fairly pricey, but I am very impressed with the quality."
627,587,4.0,good deep tone for my acoustic guitars. easily stretched and tuned with no problems. You can not go wrong with D'Addario strings.
983,587,4.0,D'Addario guitar strings are favourite strings.  They last a little longer and always sound good on my Ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars.  I usually buy them for and recommend them to others also.  You can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often.  You will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned.
1067,587,4.0,"There are two ways guitar strings go bad. If you leave them on long enough, the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode- but that takes months, if not more. Before that happens, grease from your fingers, dust, bits of skin, and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings, between the windings. This interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound. Back when strings were a lot more expensive, some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them; some bass players still do. Coated strings are a simpler alternative.These strings and similar ones like Elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings, which accomplishes two things: First, it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap, which prevents rust and corrosion. Second, it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings. The strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings. They do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings, but it's not a huge difference, and after a month or two they still sound the same.They also cost about twice as much as equivalent non-coated D'Addarios. Are they worth it? That depends. If you're an active performer, maybe. You're probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you're getting a bright sound. You're probably also buying your strings by the box. There's no real benefit to these strings. Where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy. These days I'm strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year. I have four acoustic guitars, and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played. With coated strings, I can leave a set on a guitar, and a month or two later I can pull it out of the case and it's ready to play. I still change strings if I'm going to be playing in public, but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house, these are great."
931,587,4.0,"These strings are the bomb!  I have used D'Addario's since my earliest playing days.  Over the years I have experimented with several different brands and eventually found myself at home with Elixir Polyweb lights.  After having the frets on my guitar (a Fender grand concert) redressed I noticed it had been restrung with EXP's (which I used eight years ago and loved). Since they were on the guitar, I decided to give them another try.  I am glad I did, the tone is great.  They speak with a natural, bright and lively voice that is sweet to the ears. EXP's make my guitar sound like it should. Individual notes speak with warmth, definition and depth.  They blend together beautifully when paying chords.  They have more punch to them than Elixir's do and the coating doesn't fray after a year like Elixirs either. D'Addario EXP'16s are probably the most musical strings I have ever used.  They respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking.  I was able to get eight months out of them before I noticed deterioration in tone.  I think I have found my strings and I don't see myself using anything else for a while."
16,587,4.0,"D'addario is a company I've been using since I first started playing guitar and these strings live up to their title. They DO have a warm, bright and balanced tone and they last 3-6 months for me even after playing hours a day. For people who finger style on the acoustic, it is very comfortable on your fingertips. These strings can produce very good sound with little effort, I almost always use light/light medium picks with these strings and it can get to the volume I want."
1259,587,4.0,"I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn, which has mellowed out over the years. They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings. I can't speak to the manufacturers claim of ""4 times more life,"" but as of now, I'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money. Highly recommended."
1047,587,3.0,"I like them, but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp, bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However, I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it, my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be, and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that, while giving once on the guitar, they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that, the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak, but at the current price point, I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
938,587,3.0,I've been playing guitar for years and personally I would prefer Cleartone or Elixir strings. I bought these for my little sister and she loves them. They have a really nice sound to them. I feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these.
1425,587,4.0,"I've long been partial to D'Addario strings--I don't have a guitar without them. These phosphor bronze models have found a home on my Epiphone flat-top.  As the package says, they're warm and bright--leaning just a little toward the brassy side.  They project without sounding harsh or tinny.  Playing feel is fairly smooth for round-wound strings and they last for ages.  This is a good intermediate gauge: light enough for lead work, but substantial enough to provide good backing.Guitarists tend to stay loyal to a maker and model of string.  My loyalty is certainly not shaken.  For any guitarist on another string whose loyalty might be wavering, these will reward an audition."
301,587,3.0,"doesn't last as long or sound as bright as Elixirs but these are half the price. Good bargain though for $6.99.sounds all right to me, bright and well balanced sound.My little brother can't tell the difference since he's new, but it works well on his guitar."
962,587,2.0,"I like D'Addario strings, but these did not impress me. They are not worth the extra cost, in my opinion."
253,587,4.0,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings, 12 strings, bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound, these strings produce the brightest, clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a ""bright"" sound and some have a clear, distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still, other strings have a rich, full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact, the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church, several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded ""better than usual"" or ""really good"" that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them."
826,587,4.0,These strings sound great. I Love the sustained bright tone. They work well with my cedar top guitar.  Easy on the fingers too.
58,587,4.0,"i've used many brand for my guitars for years. this one is very good, long lasting guitar strings. balanced tone as it says on the box and special coating system makes strings last longer than non-coated ones from lusting. easy to install and use, and very reasonable price. thanks amazon for this product sale."
323,587,2.0,not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about. GHS strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these. I think they lasted a week on my guitar until I could get some more GHS or Slinky Acoustics on it.
1362,587,4.0,"These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better, but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!"
55,587,4.0,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp, clean, rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different, depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds ""tinny"", any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are ""just right""."
483,587,4.0,"Okay mine has just arrived.. So first of all I want to say packaging is great!!..I have just put it on my guitar and I have to say that I am impressed!!... the sound is so warm and bright. I have a nanoweb before, and so far the EXP16 is better...  I will stay on with the EXP16 right now!!..Great quality string..."
684,587,2.0,I did not care for the tone or feel. Took them off within an hour and put back on EJ16. They had a rough feel and were stiff. Lots of folks like them but not for me.
1204,109,4.0,"I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips.  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine.  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner, picks, tuning forks, capo, etc.  and..........the price was very good.  best I could find for this time of hard case.  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case.  If you need basic protection of your guitar, this will do very well.  I do not know if it will fit other guitars.  I have heard that some are too long for it.  but.......for the Fender stat, it works just great."
971,109,3.0,are hard to beat when it comes to durability. (except the steel ones).  I use it when I travel on a plane especially
733,109,4.0,"This Gator Case is very good, I'm use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one."
214,109,3.0,A friend and I have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing/restoring older guitars. My friend had a Tele custom made for him and needed a case so I ordered this one and it hits the spot. The neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesn't move at all. My buddy likes the case so I am happy.Nothing gets 5 stars - there are no generals present.
593,109,1.0,"I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in this Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."
719,48,4.0,"These stands are just what I wanted for my studio. I like them so much, that I own five. I like the easy access to my guitars for recording sessions, and I like being able to look at them too. The multiple guitar stands are probably safer for the stage and more economical with space, but these stands are perfect for me as I don't gig much anymore. I'm very happy with the solid build. Good, solid guitar stand."
1254,48,4.0,"Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster.  Solid unit, good material and construction, though it is made in China apparently--but hey thats why its such a bargain!"
1132,48,4.0,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar, and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway, it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands, but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
1388,48,1.0,"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all."
132,48,2.0,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also, I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However, the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work, but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
573,48,4.0,These stands are truly amazing.  They function perfectly for both acoustic and electric guitars and take up very little real estate in a room.  They are incredibly stable and have a nice thick cushion at the top so the guitar won't get scratched.
1083,48,4.0,"Well built and solid stand.  It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too.  Some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom, which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar.  This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars, which should last a long time.  It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars.  Highly recommend it."
413,48,3.0,"This is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size.  Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage/transport, and it cradles the guitar nicely.Two minor issues:1) Personal gripe - the git leans back a bit more than I would like.  Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs.2) Product gripe - the two footer bars are not quite level with each other, so it rocks just a little bit.  However, with a solid body electric on it, even a little rocking can be a really bad thing.I like OnStage and own several of their products.  They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one.  I've been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it's getting better, but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn't want to give much.  Kinda sucks that it's not level out of the box, so 4 stars."
444,48,4.0,Very sturdy stand suitable for stage use. This stand even accommodates a double neck. Its not very compact when folded but I'm still giving it 5 stars.
976,638,4.0,very well made of heavy metal framework.  has a very solid base.  the neoprene sleeve is thick and soft enough to protect your guitar.  the top neck clasp keeps the guitar from tipping forward and the quick release really works.  probably the best stand.
48,638,4.0,"After 35 years of buying stands all I can say is that I should have invented it myself. I have many expensive guitars and I wouldn't use a inexpensive stand before I found this design. So if you're shopping and wonder if it's really good, you can trust me, because I'm way over qualified to pass judgement on this and I care about guitars and about Amazon shoppers."
1296,638,4.0,"Have had one for years.  Has survived many gigs and rehearsals, and many months in the trunk of my car.  Harsh environment!"
1388,638,2.0,"After trying out a few other styles and brands, I settled on this stand, wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great, but I had to return my first stand, as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal, and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right, once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly, the replacement unit I received also has this issue, but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish, and truly worthy of my guitar."
663,638,4.0,I use this stand to hold my yamaha electric guitar.It works perfectly.Super stable and doesnt take up much space.For the price I don't think it can be beat.
1428,638,4.0,"This does what you expect, it stands up a guitar. What can else can be said? It has a swing lever that keeps the instrument an an unfortunate accidents. It is portable, folds up easily for storage. I usually have a guitar on it all the time."
544,638,4.0,"I've bought 4 of these over the past couple of years.  I wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that I could use one handed.  It gives me piece of mind that somone won't just brush up against a guitar and damage it.  I've noticed that it has been backordered on several sites, so I expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too."
1343,638,3.0,"This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine, the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also, the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all, a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand."
620,638,2.0,I don't like that I have to continually tighten the knob at the back of the stand to keep the neck rest from tilting or moving and eventually falling down. The solution? Tighten the crap out of it with a wrench until you get it very snug and it won't budge.
986,609,0.0,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6"" pop filter.  If you don't, you'll wish you did."
712,609,3.0,"As stated it's a bit heavy which causes problems when used on a stand with a boom, but it's a decent product at a fair price."
1189,609,2.0,"Not easy to set up, hard to tighten down. Works well enough as a filter once you get it placed."
1004,609,4.0,"It's a good product, works well and does what it's meant to do.  I'm glad I bought it over the other main pop filter, as that one has bad reviews."
1081,437,3.0,"Not much to it, does what it should, holds a standard mic. Pivots in 1 direction only. Not the best build quality in the world (actually fairly thin plastic) but for $5 what else can you ask for? Should last a few months at least."
1208,437,1.0,"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."
671,437,0.0,Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.
719,565,4.0,"I've been buying gear from Alto Music since 1980. I've trusted them with my guitars, and they've helped me make the right decisions for my needs and budget. Last year, I bought a set of Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials directly from Alto's web site. Over the past year, I received a bunch of Amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a Shure SM7b. When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music, it was a no brainer. I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon. As for the mic, it's an SM7b, and it's everything I was looking for, despite it being a low output mic. It's smooth, has a sexy low end color, has no harshness, brittleness, or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers. I'm recording in an untreated basement, and this mic is perfect for when I'm singing loud rock stuff; it only picks up what's right in front of it and none of the room. I'm using a Focusrite 2i2, which is great for loud singing, but I'm picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well. For me the mic has been all it's cracked up to be."
1013,565,4.0,"I use my Shure SM7B mainly for podcasting and voice work and it performs extremely well in those applications.  I also use aHeil PR-40 Dynamic Studio Recording Microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item. Both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm, natural feel.One thing, well actually two things, the Shure SM7B has that the Heil PR40 does not is a set of two switches.  One for bass rolloff and one for mid-range emphasis / presence boost.  While both of these switches can be useful, I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments that need to be done.  If you don't have outboard processing, both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises (for example, someone bumping the table) to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better.When I reviewed the Heil PR-40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit.  While the PR40 is about $70.00 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR-40 users will want to use a shockmount (about $100) and pop filter / windscreen ($15 - $60) to get the best results out of the microphone.  With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens (one for normal use and one for ultra-close up use) with the microphone.  So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the Heil.Another thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR-40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank.  It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand.  Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off-axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications.The SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR-40, so you'll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer / pre-amp that can handle the microphone.The bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it.  If you're comparing it to the Heil PR-40 most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very, very close."
111,565,4.0,"You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had.  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5.Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work.  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40.  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available.  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available.  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B.  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc.  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5.  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages.  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B.Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production.  Stop looking and buy one.  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word.  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's.  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact.Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't.DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B.  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool.  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options.  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that.The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give.  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work.  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is ""THE VOICE"" microphone and that was all it was intended to be. It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone.Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably.  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice.  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise.  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else.  With the SM7B you don't have to.Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves ""Recording Engineers"" today are usually totally ignorant about.  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong.If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it.  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is.  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it.  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers.  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it. I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too.  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59.  70 dB would be better. Lots is made of the ""LOW OUTPUT"" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54.5 dB! -4.5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp.  But again most of the ""one-box-solution"" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind.The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments.  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra.  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens.  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel.  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case.  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them. The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add.  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged.  They are also very durable for foam screens.On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best. You can just leave the plate off if you want. This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic.So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work.  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one.  I still am an SM7B guy.  I would give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic."
817,565,4.0,"So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality.I have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones (Rode NT1-A, AT2020, SP C-1) and they are clear, but so sensitive that it's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room. So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B. If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above. Of those type, I like the Studio Projects C-1 Best I think, but they are close."
892,565,4.0,"What you need to know about this mic:1) This mic is very directional. You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results. Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect. I found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best. As long as I keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room I'm in. Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose. Aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal. Right at the upper lip works well for me.2) The bass cut and presence boost are convenient. Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it. I've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best. Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids. Flat's where it's at. Flat sounds most natural.3) Being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might. Though it takes EQ well, and you can EQ that in. If you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while I realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you. After using it for a few years, I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem. Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either.4) Yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so. It rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive. So if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up. So don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one. Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set. Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix.5) So what does it sound like? The sound is *very* natural and true to my voice. It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost. That plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points. It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds. It does have slight color in the mids; I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900Hz, slight boost 1000-2000Hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that. The color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range. That's one reason why this mic is considered ""flattering"" on vocals. It still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic.6) This thing is heavy and rugged. The capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides. The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors. What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do. So it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts. Even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down.7) This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing, 55-60dB for quiet singing, 65-70dB for whispering. Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain. Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB. If your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a CloudLifter and it'll add 25dB of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too.Overall, I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one. But since my room isn't perfect, this will do. The biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix. It's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B. Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results.EDIT 2014:  Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser. This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches. So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color. In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser. It really does. Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as I said below you can *easily* EQ that in, since this mic takes EQ very well. Seriously, a 2dB shelf in the highs. Another thing I wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can EQ that down a bit. And finally, when Shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it. Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest."
353,180,4.0,"I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that. When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs, sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking, but not when using this pedal. It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound. Works great if used correctly. Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound.I use this with a Gibson Les Paul, and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals.  It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion."
607,180,3.0,"I don't know if its me, but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on, i use this for booster, really sounds good! use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp.also it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedal.i recomend this one."
518,180,4.0,I like MXR products however I am always Leary of the metal button on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor. The dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive. A must for pedal boards.
330,180,4.0,This compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians' electric guitar rigs. It's very basic - two controls and one toggle - but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal. Both my jazz bass and my Precision Bass sound great through this pedal.
1304,180,4.0,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90, or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass, but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock, but when using a chain of pedals, the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price, it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
159,526,3.0,"I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them.. They could have been a litte taller, howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money.  You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra.  I would buy more if I needed them."
1291,526,3.0,"Durable, yet lightweight and sturdy. And, the price is right. Pacific hardware is excellent, right up there with Tama. I would buy this again."
1214,526,4.0,"This is a great cymbal stand sturdy, tight, well made, using it with a 18&#34; crash and does not move or rattle, amazingly well constructed stand for the price, going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these, great product. I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all, but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit. Being honest don't know how it would be for a gigging drummer, but for what I am using it for, more than does the job."
1048,526,4.0,"You can compare this to a pearl or any other popular stand ,your just not going to have the pay that hi price try it you'll like it !"
1247,731,4.0,"Nice padded seat, well constructed. good padding for comfort, I go 190lbs.  Heavy duty base, lots of adjustment if needed. love Amazon, why shop anywhere else?"
1274,731,4.0,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before, so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones, so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case, you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy, no rocking, no swaying, no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact, my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money, great product!"
255,731,4.0,I sit. I drum. It works.  There's not much to say except that it get the job done very well.
1198,731,4.0,"I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use.  It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right.  The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it.  I don't know how it would hold up for touring or constant use, but it is perfect for my needs, as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio."
1027,731,4.0,"This is actually a very sturdy yet light weight drum throne. The only issue I have is that the seat can swivel if not tightened properly, allowing the bolt to scratch the metal post (not a big deal)."
942,156,4.0,"First of all, I use this as more of a 6 band EQ using the lower and highest more for LP and HP filters.  The middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone.  You can also use this as boost box, using the gain and volume sliders.  The box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage, but I tend to set and forget.In reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful.-If you turn your gain way up, you will have hiss.  Period, this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that I have been exposed to.  Have a reason for upping your gain, if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp.-EQ is to ENHANCE your tone, not create it!  A Strat cannot be made to sound like a Les Paul and vice versa.  Your tone is made up of many, many variables.  The resulting tone can be SHAPED or COLORED by adding or subtracting certain frequencies.  That is the function of an EQ, nothing more.  IT can range from dramatic to very subtle.  Very small changes can have large effects.  Small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics I am able to produce.-I tend to put the EQ in much later in my effect chain, but feel free to experiment."
144,156,4.0,"This pedal works well, and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation.  A little goes a long way with the sliders, and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful.  Nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq.  It makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want, easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other.Ten bands is a little overkill for guitar.  Three of them are outside the range of the instrument, but I bought this one because I like that it blinks if clipping, it has the extra volume and gain sliders, and comes with the AC adaptor.  This adds no noise that I can tell, except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there.It's an all around quality product that I imagine I'll still have twenty years from now."
178,156,4.0,Comes with Adapter.This thing controls your tone so well!!!!!Everything about it is just so much worth the money im starting to fall in love with MXR!
777,156,4.0,"I had never considered using an EQ pedal before seeing and buying this, but man....I was missing out! The ten bands are truly incredible in shaping a precise sound and is especially impressive when using distortion. Each band is hyper sensitive....five for tone (high/mid/low) and five for gain. Aside from providing exact sound control, it also boosts your volume a little and functions as an overdrive as well. If you dont use distortion though, you can still benefit highly from this pedal, as even the clean channels become more crisp and effects more pronounced. This is especially highlighted when using delay or chorus, but distinctly noticeable regardless. By far the most versatile pedal I have ever used. I cant imagine not using it now that I have it. One further note....you can run this through an adapter chain if you dont want to dedicate an outlet to this one pedal....but, it is really cool that the power supply is included with the purchase. Just ups the value even further. I really cant recommend this highly enough. I think every guitarist and bass player should own one.Enjoy!"
1018,156,4.0,This is an always on pedal for me.It's at the end of my pedal board right before the BBE.It really allowed me to wake up the board - and I like the fact that I can adjust it on the fly if I don't totally agree with my tone that night.Very nice - built like a brick - every guitarist and bassist needs one of these whether you run a pedal board or not.
546,704,4.0,"I like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum. A work of caution though, like all snare resonant heads, these are very thin! They must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required. But you must be careful. I tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge. Not Remo's fault but it is something to pay attention to."
21,704,4.0,"I put this on my Cheapo $300 drumset's snare, with a Remo CS on top, and my snare when from sounding like junk, to sounding great, for a cheap drum."
2,704,4.0,I bought it for my church and the drum sounds great... I love The quality and the sound... Buy it without doubts
739,704,0.0,"Just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of."
1188,704,4.0,"We've been using Remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from Classic rock to Speed Metal.Great quality, very durable.You can buy Remo heads with your eyes closed."
545,704,4.0,"all joking aside, these heads really are great. tune em right and you'll get a nice, warm tone from them that's unmatched with other brands"
227,262,4.0,"I ran across this thing a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  I'd been looking for a boom attachment for a non-boom stand because I play guitar and sing.  This seemed perfect, and it is.  Regular booms have always been a necessary evil, in my book.  They can be helpful, but also take up too much ""air space"" on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces.  This thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself.  The other thing I like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock, so you're not just tightening a joint and relying on friction - as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired.Anyway - no reservations about this one.  A dead-simple idea that works great."
932,262,4.0,This item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars. I tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady. The locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position. The short extension in the picture is not on the unit I received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered. I would purchase this unit again and again. It is a good piece and a good deal!
1209,262,4.0,"This is a tough unit, easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition, and yeah, one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
1144,262,3.0,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar, or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more, I would opt for a boom stand instead."
1324,262,4.0,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13"" model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth, so once the angle is set and the knob tightened, it will not slip.  Get the 13"" if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7"" is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
1051,869,3.0,"I'm quite happy with any of the ""On Stage"" brand stuff I have.  Like I said, this thing is solid, well built, good quality, and they thought of all the little features you need ... jamb nut at the top, little nylon tip on the thumb wheel so you don't scratch up your post ... just good stuff."
1310,869,4.0,I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic. It works great. I would definitely buy this again. The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand. It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end.
516,869,4.0,"One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi-hat stands. I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneckto connect to the bar, then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone. The bar-gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model.This also works well for mounting on microphone stands. I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones, or a DM80 for baritones. Again, it works perfectly for my situations.I always keep a few of these, plus various size goosenecks, just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands. It's one more tool to make set up less stressful.Trust me, when you need one (and chances are you will if you're a drummer or a sound tech) you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations I cited above and those that I have not foreseen."
810,869,4.0,"Really great clamp, fastens to a vertical pipe very securely, great quality. A very nice addition to my collection. I highly recommend."
661,869,4.0,"I'm used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck.  Occassionally there are problems with this set up.  Then I saw these.  No more bendable problems, I really love these extensions."
641,869,4.0,"Ive had good success with this piece.  I use it with a straight mic stand topped with a Shure Super 55 for vocals.  I put a Heil Fin on the boom arm to mic my tenor sax.  The arm allows for a variety of positions, and serves to eliminate a second stand just for the horn mic.  My only (small) &#34;concern&#34; is the length of the arm itself.  If it was a bit shorter, or adjustable, it would help offset the (potential) balance issue created from having a mic hang that far off the stand.  In my case,  I am using a heavy microphone, so I didn't rate down the product for this reason (as I know Im pushing the issue).  I doubt that if someone was attaching a lighter microphone to the arm, it would be a issue.  That said, it's a great way to get rid of a second unnecessary stand cluttering up your stage.  We ended up buying a total 4 for our stage and freed up a ton of floor space.  A highly recommended piece."
798,869,4.0,"Haven't had this long, but so far, it's just about perfect. I had bought another On-Stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness (On-Stage MY550 - see review). This one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable, AND only costs a few bucks more (fourteen buckos at present). I've got a 13"" gooseneck and a light-ish condenser mic with a shock-mount on it, and it's as steady as can be. I'm convinced even heavier loads will be no problem. If you're in need of a side boom, look no further."
294,869,4.0,"I use this to position my iPad a way so that it's out of the sight-line of the audience, but it's also great for mic-ing drums. Sturdy, flexible and well designed. Lots of metal where there needs to be metal. Buy a few, you'll be glad you did."
601,462,4.0,"I was very skeptical to buy a Wuhan china because ive had bad experiences before and their quality control is almost non-existent.That being said, the china I received is amazing its a nice thick little cymbal and has a great sharp tone and fast decay.My opinion of Wuhan has been raised quite a bit."
923,462,4.0,"If looking for that oriental sound, this is it.  Nicely made.  Some folks expect something different, I suspect.  It is not a cymbal that you use like a crash or ride, it is more like a splash and at that it is for use for a particular sound.  Highly recommend,  And when I bought it was very well priced - like half what I could find used  (and this was NEW!)."
828,462,4.0,"Think it sounds like a trash can lid? No, it doesn't. It sounds like a crappy china which has it's place (in the rehersal studio for one...). Want a really good china? Spend more money. That's how it works. Great for practicing. Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone. Poor on recordings (unless you're looking for that... there's always an application). For $20 though, c'mon. What do you want? Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad. It's $20. It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where they've been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3,500 years and you got one for $20. Or go buy a K Kustum and quit your sniveling. I say get one! get them all in all sizes and you still spent less than an actual professional china. boyah."
1291,462,4.0,"Any size Wuhan china sounds great. This little 12-inch model is high-pitched, but has that trashy Wuhan sound. I prefer Wuhan to any Zildjian, Paiste, or Sabian china."
545,462,4.0,"wow haha!! this china...really packs a punch haha!! I got this china and was blown away by it. my band loves it, the crowds love it, and most importantly it is very loud and trashy. great for hardcore drummers"
1214,462,4.0,What can I say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal?.... great choice to add some trashy color to my cymbal set up (all Wuhans because they are cheap and blow away most of the big boy companies). One thing that surprised me was how BIG the sound was and how nice it cut right thru my other cymbals. You cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal. Placed it on top of my 18' crash and it looks great!!!
227,842,4.0,"We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals.  One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals.  It's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $150, $200, $250, $350...whatever.  There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there.I've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years, after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years.  I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals, just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix.  I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones, and for that it's just fantastic.Having two tone controls makes all the difference.  This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS.  Anyway, this thing sounds great.  Excellent classic rock and lead tones.The things it WON'T do: 1) a clean boost.  It has plenty of output, but there's always a little bit of dirt in the signal, so it can't be used as a pure clean boost.  2)  it won't clean up when you turn your guitar down...or at least not much.  No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone.  I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully.But, despite those limitations, the Bad Monkey is awesome.  At the very least it can be a great ""throw in your case to take to a jam"" pedal, but it's worth having on your pedalboard, as well."
536,842,3.0,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal, the knobs feel sturdy, and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good, cheap choice. Personally, I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800,Joyo Vintage Overdrive,Deltalab TO-1,TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated, I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808, you may want to check this out first."
1126,842,4.0,"I've had this pedal for about five years.  I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals, including the Boss SD-1, TS-9, a Klon clone, and a bunch of DIY pedals.  The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons.  First is the bass and treble controls.  Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control, the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows.  Second is the mixer out.  Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a ""speaker sim"".The gain sound is ok, but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive.  This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state.It's built like a tank.  Can't go wrong for the price, IMO."
389,842,4.0,"This is purely an overdrive pedal, not a distortion pedal.  It increases the gain and dirties your tone, but it does not actually distort your sound.If you're a metal or hard rock player, don't buy this.  It's better suited for country, soul, R&B;, blues, or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when they're doing a solo.  For that it's excellent, especially considering its very low price.And despite its very low price, it's very solidly built.  It's like a brick.This update is to point out that I've only used the Bad Monkey pedal with tube amps: A Fender Blues DeVille 4x10 and a Line 6 Spider Valve HD100 MK II running into an Ampeg 4x12.  I have no idea how it'll sound with a solid state amp.  But it sounds great with a tube amp.This update is to point out that I finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good.  I recently bought a 100 watt Fender Mustang III combo to use as a practice amp.  It perfectly compliments my Fender Blues DeVille 410/Fender Mustang floorboard combination.  As I've said, I use the Bad Monkey as a boost for soloing.  Whether I'm playing clean or dirty, the Bad Monkey gives my guitar a rich/deep/great sounding boost.This update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is.  I rarely play directly through any of my amps, e.g., Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, Blues Deville, Super Champ x2 or Ampeg B25, I'll turn down the gain on the Bad Monkey and use it for a much fatter ""clean"" sound.  It's just so thick, like texas chili with lots of umph.  You've got to get this pedal."
1075,842,4.0,"This pedal makes my Les Paul sing.  Better than I imagined, even with all the good reviews.  Such a wide range of sounds; warm jazzy boost, great blues overdrive, and almost some Black Sabbath distortion.  Makes my crappy Behringer amp sound... almost good."
775,842,3.0,"I think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated 2nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preamp!I plugged it into my DAW and listened on my KRKs and was impressed by its sound.  The overdrive is quite good.  No, it can't hold a candle to my J. Rockett Pedals Alan Holdsworth Signature Overdrive but at $48.00, it's an absurdly good buy."
79,842,4.0,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals, I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for, a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
320,842,2.0,"More knobs are not always better.  In the case of this pedal, the controls are really sensitive, there's a pretty big mid hump that's hard to dial out, and the low end control can make things really boomy, or add a little chunk to the sound.  You can do a lot with it, but I struggle to find what it does best, because it doesn't really do edge of distortion well (it doesn't clean up), and it's not a really high gain distortion pedal, but it can just add a bit of tightness, hair metal mids, or thump to a standard OD sound.  Basically, if you have your amp set for 70s rock, you can stomp on this and get Motley Crue or maybe Bark at the Moon era Ozzy.Like a tubescreamer, this thing lets a little bit of the clean signal through so you hear the distorted guitar mixed with clean signal.  The circuit design is nothing like a tube screamer, but it can work as a substitute ( I think if you wanted the tube screamer sound, theJoyo JF-01 ""Vintage Overdrive"" Pedalwould be better just for simplicity sake and being more of a clone).So it's not bad, but its just not on the level of boutique pedals and their clones.  If you get tired of it, give it to your bass player or try it with a bass for an interesting tone."
1157,842,4.0,"If you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about DigiTech effects pedals, they'll tell you to stay away from them...except for this one.  That's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $100 TS-9 Tubescreamer.In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to.  This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone.  Notes will sing and chords will really crunch, especially in blues and classic rock.  But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ.  Virtually any distortion pedal has a ""Tone"" control that will make the tone darker or brighter.  But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble (or vice versa), you may not find the sound you want.  That's what's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak, you can fatten it up.  If it's too muddy, you can add treble.  And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal, and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal.  The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal, but I find that easier to use.If you're a beginning player or a player on a budget, this would be an outstanding pedal to own, along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal.  There's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer, if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear.  But even for player where money is not an object, don't overlook the Bad Monkey.  It might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you'll need."
685,842,3.0,"I have a Boss OD which I realize now matches well with my little Vox tube amp, so I use this Bad Monkey pedal when I go direct for low level or headphone playing. Good price, good tone, pretty versatile, but I like the mid boost and harmonics I get from the Boss. The BM might work better with solid state."
504,842,4.0,"The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce ""Crazy Train"" metal distortion. It isn't made to, and thus if you buy it for that sound you're off target. (If that's the sound you want, I recommend: DigiTech TL-2 HardWire Metal Distortion Extreme-Performance Pedal.) What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious, bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price (it currently sells for $49.95 here at Amazon). Unlike so many overdrive/distortion pedals, the BAD MONKEY has independent (and sensitive) dials for treble (""high"") and bass (""low""), and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound; they are by no means token dials. In particular, the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree (especially when using double-coil pickups); it's easy to achieve a ""fat"" sound with this pedal. The pedal does not come with, but does accept, an external power supply (i.e., an adapter). It can also be powered with a 9V battery, which is installed under what's literally the pedal portion (just as in BOSS pedals). The BAD MONKEY is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed. It seems extremely rugged, again like BOSS pedals. I have several overdrive/distortion pedals, but I find myself turning to this one again and again. My impression of the BAD MONKEY is based on using it with [i] an Ibanez guitar with good double-coil pickups, [ii] an Ibanez guitar with good single-coil pickups (similar to ""soapbar"" style, or P-90, pickups), and [iii] a Fender Mustang II amp. It works well with both single- and double-coil pickups. If I lost my pedal, I would order another right away. I've been playing for over 30 years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal."
900,574,4.0,"Virtually eliminates all outside sound, allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions.  Nice, flat response."
355,574,4.0,"Mixed my band's album with these headphones - the sound quality is impressive in all ranges, and they have a very respectable bass response. They're also great for drum practice, as they block out the loudness of the drums so I can hear my metronome perfectly. They're also awesome for live recording use as a monitor. I will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future."
389,574,4.0,These do a great job at passively eliminating noise while allowing you to hear your metronome (or a mix from a soundboard) perfectly.  They are certainly worth the price.
25,574,3.0,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable, I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound, you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end, these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones, and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying, doesn't work very well, and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
408,574,3.0,"I got these for noise reduction, barking dogs, loud trucks etc. They work well for that. The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head. After a time the pinch is bit much. I have a small (7-1/4) hat size too. However, the price was great, and the sound is good. I'm no audiophile, but do play guitar, mando and dulcimer, and for me these phones deliver a good, well rounded sound.One other thing, these headphones are made for the studio, not for outdoor use.So, if you can deal with the pinch, I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality."
94,574,4.0,"UPDATE 12/6/2013: The very latest Vic Firth phones have a MUCH-improved headband and less-bulky earcups. While I now prefer the latest Direct Sound EX-29s (a vast improvement over my original DS cans, mentioned below), the Firth's are still VERY good and, as a bonus, cost half as much. I still use both brands.Please remember to carefully monitor your SLP (volume) level with ANY isolation phones. Without background noise for reference, one can easily play them too loudly which, in turn, can lead to hearing loss over time.UPDATE 4/23/2010: I now own three pairs of Vic Firth isolation headphones and I'm happy to report the original pair is still going strong. Meanwhile, my office setup now consists of two ART Tube MP units...carefully adjusted to add little/no volume to the signal path (unity gain)...as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a Behringer U-Control UCA-202 DAC and a small Behringer Eurorack UB-502 mixer to provide silky-smooth state-of-the-art amplification for the Vic Firth isolation headphones. The resulting sound is absolutely top-drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price....about $150 total...I paid for the entire system. Affordable technology in the service of great art!UPDATE 2/3/2009: These bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time. I now own two pairs of Vic Firth headphones. The newest pair live in my gym bag. Both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble (e.g. getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat).BONUS TIP: Because these are full-sized headphones with large ear cups, I frequently use them in conjunction with the new Hearos High Fidelity ""full audio spectrum"" ear plugs (&lt;$15). The combo works in much the same the way Dolby noise reduction does. I play my MP3 player (or other signal source) 12 decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate 12 decibels...leaving me with the same music and way less background noise. This stuff may not fit your head/ears as well as it fits mine, but you might try it if you're so inclined.ORIGINAL REVIEW: How does an ADHD adult maintain focus in a busy, high-tech work environment? Soothing music is part of the fix. Active noise canceling headphones? I've tried and replaced several...but they either sound badly, are prone to electrical/mechanical problems, or both. What to do? Vic Firth and Direct Sound have effective and durable answers. Isolation headphones. I own and use them both. The Direct Sound phones block a bit more noise...the Vic Firth are more comfortable for extended wearing. Both have excellent sound quality. Enjoy!"
201,574,3.0,these do a good job of isolating out the sound.  They work very well.  Would recommend it to other people
309,574,4.0,these things muffle sound great.  they have good sound quality.  perfect for recording loud drums. perfect for drowning out people
1214,662,4.0,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif, simple and easy set up, just plugged it in and it worked fine, no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal, a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif, that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that, so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL),"
998,662,4.0,Does what it should and Yamaha quality.  The price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal.  I am using on a Yamaha board.
874,94,4.0,"I bought this guitar about 2 years ago and I have played tons of different acoustic guitars from Taylor to Fender and more. This is by far the nicest acoustic guitar I have played. The action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well. I love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars. Additionally, this is my favorite guitar and I would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic. This guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars. The guitar has no finish which I prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands. I love Takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value. This guitar will last forever because it was made so nice. Recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature I promise you won't be disappointed and I have been playing for 6 years so I know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar. Thanks Takamine!!!!!"
888,94,4.0,"This is not a toy.  It's a well crafted instrument.  Material is wood.  Decent quality.  Plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it.  Good refinements.  Rings around the hole and stripe on the back.  Strings had some oxidation.  Understandable as it was made and shipped from Indonesia.  Metal strings.  So that's a consideration if you're a beginner.  Sounds good too.  I prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway.  So if you're a beginner or an intermediate player who just needs a nice instrument hanging around home for an occasional strum this is it.  It is a pleasant addition to my home guitars.  It's for my wife who is learning guitar.  She loves it.  And it costs 10% of what mine costs, and I don't mind playing it at all.  The only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming.  I don't even have that.  It's a feel good guitar.  Highly recommended for the occasional strummer."
632,94,4.0,"After going to various guitar/music stores and trying out many guitars (Yamaha,Ibanez, Fender and others) I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make/model and saw the MANY positive reviews it had. I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first, so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally (costing me $129). After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online. The many reviews were absolutely correct. THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great. I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought. Even though it is only an $89 guitar, I will treasure this one as if it was $300. Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave. Low action and stays in tune for days!"
901,94,1.0,not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway
465,94,4.0,I bought it just so I could learn a little bit of guitar. It sounds good and looks really nice. I get compliments on it.
694,94,4.0,"Yeah, the strings that it came with were terrible, but it's an amazing guitar. I'll admit I bought it because it was cheap so I could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged, but it sounds great and plays really well. I like how the wood finish isn't all slick, has a nice natural feel to it."
1270,94,2.0,This beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price. It's lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes. The biggest drawback is that the one I received required the action to be adjusted. The bridge needed lowered slightly and the nut held the strings way too high above the frets. The result was very sore fingers. These are easy fixes if you have the proper tools. Otherwise you'll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup. Stock strings have a warm tone.
80,94,4.0,"I've paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didn't sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does. And, mind you, I have yet to even change the facory strings out! So if you're looking for a quality guitar at a price that's more than fair, there simply isn't a better deal around."
629,94,4.0,"I didn't know what to expect given the price, but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials, components, and construction. For example, the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly, and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high, but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so, and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point, probably when it comes time to replace the strings, but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought, which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price, but the proof is indisputably before me."
68,94,4.0,"I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter.  She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach.  The action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up..was ready to go out of the box.  I almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice.  I have been playing for about 30 years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet, full, rich sound.  If you are looking at this guitar, buy it!  You will not be disappointed!"
763,94,3.0,"This was my first guitar.  I've had it for about 5 or 6 years now.  My wife bought it at a local ""center"" from the recommendation of one of the teachers.  I taught myself to play on this.  First the good:  This instrument is a good beginner piece. It has a nice full sound and does not take steel fingers to make acceptable sounds.  The tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great.  The fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price. It looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas.  The frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good.  Tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well.  Often only a tweak or 2 before a practice session is all that is needed.  I have never had it go out of tune while playing (even when stringbending!)  As you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine.  It is amazingly playable.  From simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all!  The only real compliant I had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the stock strings aren't the best (IMHO) for a beginner.  I'm pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound, and WON'T break, they are BRUTAL on new fingers!  I would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on.  The only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings.  All in all this is a great deal for the beginner- or even advanced players that just want an extra guitar around to jam on when they don't feel like dragging out the expensive units (like playing around a campfire, or outdoors)  If your a beginner just starting out- this is a great route to go as the guitar will continue to give great sounds as you advance!"
1108,94,4.0,"I recived this guitar today(2/8/13)and its perfect. After I tuned it it sounded great,it plays well,and it does not hurt my fingers like my old guitar. This guitar is amazing!"
1137,689,4.0,"I have many expensive cases for my guitars and recently started playing bass,  but not too serious just wanted a nice little case for it. Boy was i surprised, this case is awesome, great quality, fits bass without any problems and the storage inside is great. Definetly reccomend this case"
651,689,4.0,"Bought bass case for strat,wanted extra space.as the lining is q memory foam and holds the instrument gently in place it also acts as the lid for the open space.I keep several music/note. Books under the head stock.other reveiwer complained of the excess space but that's what I wanted. It did have chemical smell but as I open items in garage,near trash can for the packaging.it aired in a few minutes. Totally happy with service and product."
516,689,2.0,"This is nearly identical to theGuardian Cases CG-020-B Bass Guitar Caseat about half the cost. However, there are some issues with this case as well as limitations.First the issues: while the covering appears to be stitched on, it is - for the most part - glued on, and if the case is left in a hot, unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges. On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods. However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass.The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic. The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides. This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs, but if you have a heavy road schedule, and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band's gear, this case will not afford you the protection of an ATA-style case.Also note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass, so any long-scale J- or P-style basses will fit. I cannot be sure about other brands and models.I mentioned an ATA-style case as a better solution, and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules. For less demanding protection I recommend that you also consider this case (which I purchased as an upgrade when I became aware of the issues and limitations of the Musician's Gear model:SKB Electric Bass Rectangular Hardshell, standard latches, handle.If you still opt for the Musician's Gear case, you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag."
938,689,3.0,"When I was looking for a Bass Case I just wanted something that was not too expensive and would protect my bass. This fits the bill perfectly. It's not really a case that is meant for heavy travel (like checking it a the airport) but it definitely will take good care of your bass during normal travel. And the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps, cables, strings, etc. For the price this is an excellent case."
294,689,3.0,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made, which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said, they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig, but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So, I recommend them, but be aware of its limitations."
546,891,4.0,I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well.
271,891,3.0,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right, but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high, it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs, so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
267,891,3.0,good product  great price  works well so far  bought 2 for the price of one of the others  free ship  one for the road  one for pratice
159,891,4.0,"This drop clutch is just fantastic..  I have used them for years and always buy the same model.  Nothing on the market works as well as this.  Simple installation,  and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick.. It couldn't be easier..  Best Buy on the Market."
545,891,4.0,"it's amazingly helpful during double pedal licks haha!! while you're goin all out on pedals, you can just use the drop-clutch to make it sound like the hat is open OR closed...depends on what you want. it's really useful and I recommend it if you double pedal a lot"
709,891,4.0,"This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal, but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top. This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals, yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it.Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed. However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound.  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed.  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening.  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound. Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound.  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a ""must have"" accessory. Gibraltar's model is solid, heavy duty, and engages and disengages perfectly every time."
427,207,4.0,"I like to hit things. I use drums so nobody else gets hurt. I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not, say, local wildlife. These have the sweetest tone for battery-based abuse. Thanks Vic! Also, flammable!"
21,207,4.0,They are some of the best drum sticks i've played. They lasted me about two weeks before I had to move on to another before.
1294,207,3.0,sad right?i do play instruments (guitar & piano) some drums but it's not why i bought these drum sticks.My old roommmate stole my drum sticks so this was the next cheapest thingthey play well on the pads.i'm sure they'd have nice action off a snare drum and high hat in real life...
25,207,3.0,"I have always liked these sticks. They are solid, look good and feel good. You will always get quality from vic firth. Only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as Vaders."
415,207,4.0,"These are great for all around playing. I've never received a bad stick from Amazon. These are reasonably priced and so much more convenient than going to Guitar Center and having to deal with the idiot in the drum room.I have a wide variety of Vic sticks that I bought here on Amazon. Another favorite is the 2BN, it's a log with a nylon tip, great for heavy metal thrashing, very articulate.Good music to all"
765,207,4.0,"Nice feeling to them, they get the job done and that about sums it all up, can't expect to much more from them."
1350,132,4.0,"I've been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time, but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands, as I'm rather petite.  Luckily for me, we found one of these secondhand (it needed minimal repairs)and it's just great.  I don't know anything about purchasing it new, but I can tell you that this is a great beginner's instrument for someone who has small hands.  I'll also note that it's even affordable while it's brand new.The notes are surprisingly clean-sounding coming from a guitar that's so low-priced. I'd definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument."
271,132,2.0,"I was very impressed by this little guitar. The build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless.The only complaints I have is E string breaks often, which is a direct result of constant tuning fatiguing the strings.I feel the tuners are just not strong enough and the ratio is no adequate to keep in tune.Still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old."
300,132,3.0,The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument.
996,132,4.0,"I bought this to replace my son's previous guitar that had broken from hard use. From initial unboxing it is clear that this has been made to a much better standard. The wood looks beautiful. All the metal parts look sturdy and durable.It sounds good, although as my son is a beginner I cannot judge just how good.Note that there is no guitar cable.For now I am very happy with this purchase as it looks better made than I expected."
615,132,2.0,"I've been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7-year-old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does.  For $100 it's an OK starter guitar for a kid (and I guess really short people who can't play a regular Fender), but not something I'd recommend to anyone else.  And my kid thinks it looks cool, so he'll be more likely to stick with it.Even though it has a laminated body, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood.  The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them, and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed.  It's light and easy to handle.  The hardware isn't bad, with a stable bridge (good idea not to put a floating trem in this), 5-way blade switch, solid jack and strap anchors, and smooth knobs.  The pickups are not top notch but work well enough (a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does, so I'm not complaining).  It has a nice red paint job.On the down side, besides some sharp fret ends, it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be.  The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret.  The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side, so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings.  It has one small pit in the red finish.  It has no paperwork or owner's manual.  The tuners are kind of choppy.  And the body/neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune.It comes strung with Fender 9's, which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down, so it's good for a kid just starting out.  I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound.  But as soon as he gets bigger we'll ditch this for something better."
1234,132,4.0,"I got this guitar for my 9 year old son, He loves it. This is a buitifull clasic guitar with a good clear sound (when he is not messing with the knobs). I would definatly purchase this again."
908,132,3.0,Thank you Fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size...and thanks to all of you that recommended it for just that reason : )
57,838,4.0,"I had a lot of questions and concerns when I ordered this. Well, it arrived today, I've been playing it for the past few hours, and here's the answers to those questions:1. Is it worth the money?Absolutely yes. This is an amazing bargain. There are better guitars out there, but not for $170. This really is a great deal.2. How does it sound?Fantastic. It's definitely ""bright"", which a few of the other reviews pointed out, but it also has new strings on it, so it might be a little too early to judge. That said, it's got a nice full sound and if you play up closer to the neck you get more bass in the mix.3. How's the action?Just right. Low enough that it's easy to play (for a 12 string) but no buzzing strings.4. How about the neck?Wider than a 6 string, but not much. Probably a centimeter or so wider. I have small hands and had no problem playing it. The main thing is the added pressure it takes to push down twice as many strings as normal.5. How does it play?Great.6. How does it look?Great. Nice natural finish, all shiny and new. What's not to love? (Note: the picture shows a more whitish finish, but it's a normal natural finish like you'd see on most acoustic guitars. Natural wood color.So if any of you guitarists have been thinking of buying an acoustic 12 string, take a look at this one for sure. I wish I'd bought it long ago. There are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string."
1110,838,4.0,"With all the other great reviews noted here, I decided to buy this guitar. Had a Rogue 12 string a few years ago and sold it as I was not that impressed with it. What a difference with the Epiphone.  The fit & finish speaks quality. Playabilty is very good with low action and good tone. Really is a great buy!"
157,838,3.0,"I wanted a 12 string, but did not want to spend a lot of money, this guitar fits the bill. The finish is much darker then the pictures online show. GREAT SOUND from this bad boy. This is a BIG GUITAR, once I figured out how to tune the 12 string, it really DOES NOT GO OUT OF TUNE.. After I few hours of play, I retune it and its marginally out of tune, I thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality, while they are not grover tuners, they get it done.The downside for me is, not the guitar's fault.. this is an inexpensive guitar and a FANTASTIC entry into 12 string playing, this Guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away, but that is true of all guitars using this body type. Now that I have had it awhile I would love for it to be acoustic/electric but again.. for the price, I was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action. Im keeping it."
1096,838,3.0,"I knew I did right by buying the DR-212. It's great and stands up to much more expensive of it's kind.I have lots of Gibsons as well as Epiphones and frankly I don't see any difference to speak of. If anybody wants a durable acoustic 12 string with fine sound you'll find it in the DR-212.Best of Luck to allRegards,Roger  Epiphone DR-212 Acoustic Guitar, 12-String, Natural"
1201,838,4.0,"First off, let's get the dimensions out of the way; for some reason, finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible; just try to find the dimensions of the DR-212 on the Epiphone web site.Length: 43"",  Bout length: 19-7/8"",  Lower bout thickness: 4-3/4"",  Lower bout width: 15-1/2""So now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it.The only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions, is the 43"" length (Most bags are 39""-41"").You can always opt for the Epiphone hard case: EDREAD, or World Tour RWG20D, or GBA100 (the bag I got).Now that the hard part is out of the way (finding a case), on to the review.As my title says, the guitar reminds me of my Samick ST92 which is a VERY well made 3/4 Spruce top acoustic which is also made in Indonesia.I have played guitar for over 40 years, so I  have a collection of over 100 guitars, and 11 of them are acoustics, but this is the first12 string, and I bought it just to have it around for songs like Hotel California, Etc., and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar I would rarely use.I am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under $170.00 asking price. It tuned up with no problems, even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string, and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out. You constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure. The bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge!I found that when tuning, you should up stroke the small strings so that you don't hit the large one right next to it.I have no fret buzz, finger rash, or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar, and the strings sit low which I like.The nut is a bit sharp on the edges, but a file or sanding will take care of that.The strings are not that bad, and will do until the first change out.I have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar, from terrible to fantastic, but the one I have is the later."
275,838,4.0,"Very playable right out of the Box and very beautiful. I have a Epiphone Swingster, Nighthawk and Violin Bass and they are all great products! I decided to give it a good set up. After the Strings were off I sanded down the Bridge 1-2 mm and adjusted the neck just a little. Then I want to really recommend Martin Bronze Strings light or extra light (green box) for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on 12 Strings. Instructional videos can be viewed on YouTube before you go for it or you get a Guitar Tech to do it.Ps Matching Epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an Amp or line in recording.Ps The Tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion. When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner."
307,838,4.0,"If you're looking for a 12-string acoustic, then what more could you want than the Epiphone DR-212?  The craftsmanship is excellent, the sound is fantastic and it's easy to tune and play right out of the box.  Add the limited lifetime warranty and Gibson support and this guitar can't be beat.  The price is amazing for what you get, and to top this all off, it has been chosen as a Guitar Players Magazine Editors Pick.  You don't have this guitar?  What are you waiting for?  Order it now while the price is this low!  Go ahead! Go for it!  You won't be sorry..."
455,838,4.0,"I was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets. The action is better than my six string Epiphone acoustic. It sounds so sweet, looks so sweet, and plays so sweet. I keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck. I would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget. It stays in tune and don't let the laminated top scare you, its great."
254,9,4.0,"Still using it today, 2 years later."
227,9,4.0,"For years I've used the super-cheap ""rake hangers"" you can get at hardware stores - the metal ""U"" coated in rubber, with the heavy-duty screw end.  These are fine, except that some guitars don't want to fit, and recently when trying to widen the mouth of one the weld failed and so the ""U"" detached from the screw part.Well, that got me to thinking that I should find a better solution for hanging my guitars.  The thing is, I hate overpaying for things.  To me, $15-20 is way too much for a guitar hanger.  Sure, it's important to have something solid to hold our ""babies"", but I want to feel like I'm getting some value.I bought 2 of these hangers, and they're rock-solid.  As others have said - put some good screws into a stud, don't bother with the hassle of the drywall anchors provided.  I just used some 2"" drywall screws.  I like the simplicity of the metal plate that the yoke is attached to.  The U is easy to adjust for width, the retainer rings slide on very easily, and I've tried both acoustic and electric guitars and all hang away from the wall.No complaints - these are great, the quality seems excellent and $9 seems just about right to me."
1296,9,4.0,"I have an older version of this model, but it works great.  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot.  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used, so it was already assembled, so I can't comment too much on the assembly process.  I bought 2 of them, and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no, I don't own stock in the company!  :-)"
991,9,4.0,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments, mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very, very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners, I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete, and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments, but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable, and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
590,9,4.0,"I decided I wanted to hang my guitars on my walls instead of having them take up space via floor stands. Just find a stud and drill in the screws they'll hold just fine. I'm really bad when it comes to stuff like this so I had my brother help me. Just make sure you know what you're doing because I thought I did when I really didn't at all.The wall hangers look really nice in person, and they keep the guitars held in place very nicely/safely. The only thing you should have to do extra after purchasing and installing these is creating a makeshift wallpad for behind where the guitar is hung; if something happens that makes it hit the wall, it won't damage the guitar or the wall.This is as legit as it gets if done right, though; I've had my guitars hung via String Swing for months and I've had no problems or concerns. I am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands. It saves room and makes the room look cooler."
262,9,3.0,its cheap and the quality its great cant complain. i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars.
1028,9,2.0,"I used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele.  It's attractive.  It's well made. It's fork is a tad large for the ukulele  It has rubber o-rings that slide, so I can bring them in and the uke does fit then.  But then, even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase (or wall, if you use it there).  The uke hits when I put it in the hanger, so I put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase.Many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners.  This is much less expensive, holds very well, is even more low profile than this hanger, and never drops a uke. Consider it for your needs.I'd not buy another of these for a ukulele.  It likely works fine for a guitar, though.I deducted one point for the fact that, even though it's adjustable (the o-rings), and advertised for ukes, it doesn't work well for them.  And it's heavy and not stylish, in my opinion.  I have the Hercules wall hanger (mechanical gripper) for my electric guitars, and it's fabulous (for guitars; overkill for lightweight ukuleles, maybe).Hercules Stands Wallmount Guitar Hanger GSP39WBUpdate 9/7/11: the more I use it, the less I like it.  I find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all, and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune.  So, for small instruments (you'd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos), this is atrocious.  For guitars, it's not as good as Hercules."
278,9,4.0,Very nice product great quality.  I ordered three to start was not sure if I wanted to trust my Guitars to them.  Arrived installed in minutes they come with plastic toggles to screw into drywall I chose to hit studs.  Rubber washers come with to size for different necks.  If you are going to mount off a stud I strongly suggest using an aftermarket high quality toggle  made from steel.  Very happy going to order more.
878,9,4.0,"very good item if you are a musician you need it! cool for any bass, guitar and any instrument that fit into the hanger"
1249,9,4.0,"Will hold any guitar that I've seen. It holds the guitar on the wall safely without having to worry about it falling. It's also very easy to install. It's a great price; and it's definitely worth the investment. Not only do you not have to have your guitars on the ground, but you save space putting them on the walls, and not only that, but it make any room look even better."
452,9,4.0,This thing works great and it looks very stylish with the guitar hanging on the wall.  This also keeps it away from the kids who always seem to want to play it.  Very good idea and holds it perfectly.
506,9,4.0,"Purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home.  I saw them used in a guitar shop so I assumed they were more than sufficient for use at home. I'm using them with both acoustic and electric guitars. They appear to be designed to hang the guitar away from the wall to avoid abrasions on the back and they do just that. The hooks can be stretched apart or squeezed together to fit the headstock of the guitar.  Overall, they are attractive, well-made hangars."
238,9,4.0,I love these string swings!  My guitars are now out of their cases and up for display.  I have 3 in my home:  2 for guitars and 1 for a ukulele...and I'm planning on buying 25 of them for my school ukulele program.  They look great up on the wall.
1353,9,4.0,I love these things. They hold your guitars in place and make this storage solution a nice decoration in the process!
202,9,4.0,The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully.
37,9,4.0,it can hold the weight of any of my guitars. its easy to install and i guess its cheap. it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter
792,9,4.0,I bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall.  Comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
527,393,4.0,Solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder. The joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material. If anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts. Right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place. Arrived a day eRly.
13,393,3.0,"it is a good purchase.  I expected a bit more heftiness but it does the job.  I would like the plate to be heavier, seems a little flexy"
643,393,4.0,I was surprised of how well this stand is made. It's worth $45 easily. I;ve used stands for over 27 years and this is the best I;ve owned!
1054,393,4.0,"Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs, which this has, and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory, and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable, and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!"
1006,393,3.0,"This has the largest top of any of my stands, and it is the one I use when traveling / gigs. The top doesn't fold like some of the more expensive Stagg  Hercules stands, so if you're using it for gigging, that may be something to consider. I have to lug an 88key weighted piano around, so don't mind lugging this."
613,393,4.0,"This is a great music stand, I like how it's adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in.  It's very sturdy and well built.  I don't ever worry that it'll tip over.  I love it.  I would recommend it."
700,393,4.0,"This music stand is og great quality and of a great price.I have been very pleased with it. I have bought On-Stage stands in the past before, so i was sure that I wouldn't be disaapointed and I was right.Very sturdy-well built-good price."
404,393,4.0,"I purchased this model for home use--not for a kid's backpack. It's solid and sturdy, easily holding a song book open--not just a few pieces of sheet music. It adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening. I often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down. Works for me!"
334,393,4.0,"I'm very happy with this stand.  It is heavy, which I knew going in.  But for my purposes, that is a plus.  The weight makes it more sturdy.  It folds up compactly, so it is quite portable, despite the weight.  Adjusts easily and holds its position."
506,393,4.0,"Purchased after another folding stand which cost the same $$$ literally fell apart.  This one is much better although not quite as portable.  On the plus side, music stays put on this one, it's very stable and the height is fully adjustable.  You can buy with confidence."
56,393,4.0,This was very easy to put together! Top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable. Love it!
800,393,4.0,I am very pleased with this music stand.  It is working well for me and it holds my very heavy music binders so far .  I would recommend it to others to try.
1335,393,2.0,"On-Stage makes decent products, but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times. That would have been perfect! Otherwise, it works fine."
318,393,3.0,"I left my trusty Manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when I came upon this alternative offered by Amazon.  As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home, I've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years.  There's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust, yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension, preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward.  But the ""rub"" is their non-adaptability.  The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music.  Consequently, these ubiquitous, well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan, especially with a couple of keyboards, amps, instrument stands, and other requisite gear on board.This is where Amazon's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive (of course, it doesn't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset).  It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music.  Consequently, it's much easier to find a convenient place--whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat--for packing the stand.  Simply ""slide"" it into position.The drawback--apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about (be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws!)--is that this thing is heavy.  Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you've owned or been around the latter, the first thing you're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable, substantial addition in weight. At the same time, with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, serrated wheels), the On-Stage stand doesn't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset--in other words, I'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long, exhausting 4-hour gig.Bottom line: the On-Stage appears to be a good value--a truly heavy-duty stand (in most respects) that'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs.  But don't expect it to lighten your load or, simply because it's heavier, to last longer than a Manhasset.If you do a lot of traveling and don't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand, there's at least one truly lightweight (albeit plastic) stand that's worked out really well for me (perhaps needless to say, some haven't--they fall apart or they're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving, pint-sized cases).  But the Peak stand is made to hold up (in turn, it holds up relatively heavy music books) and has served me well for several years (just as I was about to condemn the stand, I called the company, they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped, and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since).  It'll cost you a bit more, but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds."
588,393,4.0,"I've purchased other types, but I keep coming back to this one. For the $$ it's the best buy in my opinion."
1248,393,4.0,"On Stage makes some very nice products.  This music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units.  Well made and the price doesn't put it out of range for the everyday musician.  Really am liking On Stage products, also bought 2 of their boom mic stands and they are excellent."
796,497,0.0,CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again
717,497,4.0,"I was using slinkys for several years but decided to give these a shot because the slinkys kept corroding so quickly. Anyway, these seem to hold up a little better. Both sound good, but these last a couple weeks longer. So stock up!"
45,497,4.0,These sound good on my electrics.  The best sound I got was on my strat.  Good sustain and strings are holding up well.
1337,497,4.0,"These are great strings! Break in quickly and hold their tune, work for all styles of playing. My go to strings from now on."
48,497,3.0,"These strings are okay, but nothing special except for the price, which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad, it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least, if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
954,497,4.0,"I love D'Adarrio strings. Great tone and it last long, feels great on your fingers. D'Adarrio strings rule.  See ya!"
297,497,4.0,"I'm not a string nazi and will play pretty much any major brand of strings with few exceptions.  D'Addarios are good quality and combined with Amazon Prime a no brainer bargain, under $3 per set delivered.  Unless you just don't like D'Addario I would recommend these strings highly."
546,497,4.0,I don't know a lot about guitars and strings. I bought these for my daughters guitar and they sound very nice on there.
542,497,4.0,These are my go-to strings. They are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding. What more do you need?
997,497,4.0,"I love these strings. They are bright and feel really good on my hands.I have a Gretsch and use 11's D'addario on it, best strings I've found so far. I also bought a pack of half wound 11's to TRY. I'll decide which to use (round or half wound) after my experiment."
1210,497,3.0,"I bought these strings to try on my guitars. They sound good on a variety of models, like SG,Les Paul, Rickenbacker. They have a melodic tone and good intonation, and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape."
332,497,4.0,"I've been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels. These strings I have to say, stretched out and stayed in tune much faster than slinkys. They have great sustain and sound nice and chunky. I love the luster and shine of new strings, feels nice ans springy. Since this is my first time with this brand, I don't know how long they will stay good, but we'll see."
1107,497,4.0,"Put my Schecter C-1 Custom FR in Drop Bb, these strings sound great and have a great low end. Highly reccomend."
715,497,4.0,"I started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in December of 2012 and continue to do so to this very day. He absolutely swears by them. He does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in Hawaii makes them prone to rusting. Other than that, the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality. He highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there."
306,497,4.0,"I have used these strings since they first came out. D'Addario make the best strings out there. I am sure there are others who do a good job, but you can actually hear the difference. It doesn't really matter which you buy - they all sound different - as in better!!"
538,497,3.0,Obviously these aren't top of the line strings but I used them to record a track in drop C and it sounded awesome. After about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin.D'addario is awesome if you keep in mind that they're on the cheaper side.
1357,497,1.0,"I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go ""flat"" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster."
350,497,4.0,I have been using D'adario strings for 30 years. They sound great. They stay in tune. Excellent sustain. I can get better string control compared to other strings. I have never experienced a string break in 30 years.
890,497,4.0,"I swear by these strings. These are the only strings I will use on my Les Paul. Their bright tone sounds great and full, while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze. Don't buy these strings just because I like them, buy them because they suit you. Because you like the tone they provide. Because they feel good against your fingers. Cons?? What cons...?? Try them."
1132,497,4.0,"Excellent guitar strings - they last a long time, sound great and are pretty cheap."
1388,497,3.0,"I absolutely love using these strings (10-46) on my Telecaster and Stratocaster. They just lend to that awesome Vintage tone and seepage that people like me go nuts over. If you're looking for a replacement set of strings, you simply cannot go wrong with the EXL sets here on Amazon."
73,497,2.0,"These are excellent, inexpensive guitar strings. They are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently. For the more casual player, these might not be the best choice.For the gigging musician, there is nothing better than these D'Addario strings. They are light weight, have great sound, and are inexpensive. These might take a very slight nod over Ernie Ball strings.For the more casual musician, somebody that isn't changing their strings once a week, these are probably not a great choice. Personally, I use Elixir strings on my electric guitars, a Les Paul 2008 Standard and a 1982 Gibson Lucille. I do not play gigs, so a set of strings doesn't see an hour or two of really hard playing per night. The coating on Elixir's helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers; I like their feel a bit better than these strings. I get about a month of playing from those strings. Sadly, these D'Addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing.I've tried a variety of strings, Ernie Ball, Elixir, and D'Addario, on my guitars and the way I play, the Elixir's just sound and play the best to me. Of course, your mileage may vary. If I did start to play gigs, I would probably switch to a more affordable string like these.A silly cosmetic thing, I hate the packaging of these strings. D'Addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products. The strings come in a cardstock outer box, with a single plastic package inside. Each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge. I change strings myself, and I really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings, with the gauge clearly printed on the package. If you are new to changing strings, or only change them infrequently, this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you. Especially at first, I preferred to work with one string at a time.D'Addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings. Their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic. I kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started. They could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary.In the end, the silly colored balls at the end of the strings, well they look goofy on my guitars. I wouldn't mind the colors on an acoustic (the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway), but those balls are visible on my electric guitar. I just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings."
1218,497,4.0,I have always used D'Addario strings. Since the early 70's when I first found out they were manufactured right here on Long Island. I've never been disappointed by the quality.
574,497,3.0,What can you say about the best of the best.  I wouldn't use anything else on my guitar to get the best tonal quality from it.  These strings seem to last longer than the others I've used.  I highly recommend them.
140,497,2.0,"I read all of the reviews and bought 6 pairs of these based on the reviews.So, I put these on my Gibson Les Paul last night and played for a few hours.  I didn't hammer the strings, just played easy, mostly the Eagles.As I was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward, I took a quick look at the strings.  I was shocked to see the high E and B strings were already flattened.  I never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing.The strings sounded great, but by the time I had them stretched enough that they would hold tune, they were already worn.I guess I'm going to HAVE to go to heavier strings so I'm not changing strings every few days.  These just did not perform as expected.Giving these 3 stars is being generous.  I have 5 sets to use up now, damn.  I was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up, but they lasted for only two hours......my Fender 3250L bullets at least lasted a few weeks.  Going to try the Fender on my Gibson and see how they sound.  I'm still in search of the ""perfect"" set of strings.  I'm open to suggestions"
723,497,4.0,"I decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls. Wow! Just wow! My inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound. It was just... Right. I can't explain it exactly. The .10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning, although can be tuned lower. I would recommend something thicker for that though. But these are great and you should get em!"
1155,497,1.0,"I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright."
840,497,4.0,These strings are just prefect and feel awesome.  As you can tell from the amount of reviews on this product they are extremely popular.. and all those people cannot be wrong
560,497,4.0,I enjoy this very much! Very good strings! It's a good brand too! I recommend it for any acoustic that you have or will have!
148,497,4.0,"Not much to say, these are your basic hex core, nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice, and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also, it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag, with color coded washers, (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary, if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review, you're out experimenting.  For others, the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
257,497,4.0,I have been using this brand in several different gauges for many years and continueto do so. I get long life and very good clarity from D'Addarios.
1118,497,4.0,"These aren't usually my go-to strings, but D'Addarios are a good, solid sounding string. They last fairly long when taken care of, and don't usually break too often. I DO like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing. They will continue to be my 2nd string of choice, as they've not failed me any time I've purchased them. Definitely recommended."
570,497,4.0,These are a great alternative to phosphor bronze transatlantic cables for acoustic guitar! I would rather concentrate on making music. Why fight your guitar?
1041,497,3.0,My son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings. Not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago. These strings tend to repel the dirt and dust even with heavy play the strings look very good. He has been getting less callous on his fingers. The tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price. My son has a very heavy hand but these strings are well made and withstand play from any style.
472,497,3.0,"The gauges are identical to Ernie Ball Regulars (yellow label) but the D'Addario's string tension feels stiffer, which is nice for slide playing. I like my action medium-low, comfortable for straight playing and bending, solid intonation for chords, yet not too much fret rattle for slide.I usually stretch the heck out of Ernie Ball's after putting them on because they have so much spring in them. I deliberately left the D'Addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all. Their new sound is quite bright as advertised, but has far less of what I call `new string jangle', which is fine by me. As a kid, I'd sweat that off in an hour but these days, playing a number of instruments, it can last awhile.There's a string tension chart, handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number.  I'll admit I'd never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting, but apparently that's the case and D'Addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set. If you do come across fakes, if you're willing to report it, they'll provide you with a genuine replacement for free.I've used D'Addario phosphor-bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over 25 years and swear by their quality and consistency. I've used Ernie Ball's on electrics for even longer. Habits can be tough to break but, as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots, I find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings. Finally nailing a sound and feel you've been chasing after for years makes it all worth it."
927,497,4.0,"I ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago.  Ultimately, they're simply the best for the money.  You can get them for less than $3 per pack, if you shop around."
804,497,4.0,"I have used D'Addario strings for years on my Gibson Les Paul and they sound GREAT. Had a stint where I tried coated strings on the Paul but they just didn't have the ringing bright tone that D'Addarios have. I've never been one to have strings break on me that often, guess I just don't play that heavy-handed, but I have many friends who do and who still use these and find them very reliable. They are comparible in tone to Dean Markely's and Slinky's IMHO. I very much recommend these strings to anyone who plays electric guitar of all styles - I have used them on rock, country, jazz, fusion and christian contemporary gigs. Very dependable. The set usually lasts me a couple of shows before I change them out - like any string they will lose brightness after a couple of gigs. Strings claiming to last longer than that in tone are, in my opinion, usually somewhat lifeless to begin with. Anyway... these are great threads for the ole geetar - if you have never used them you should try them out... good stuff."
879,497,4.0,"As I stated about some other guitar strings I purchased here, these D'Addarios for my electric guitar give me the sound, service and price point I need!"
576,497,4.0,"great strings, and they last well! i've never had a problem with these and i'm glad i can get them on here for a decent price."
389,497,4.0,I've been using D'Addario XL strings since the 80s.  I love 'em.  The 10 pack price is amazing.
243,497,4.0,"The best strings I ever bought and I've bought them all. I got these for my electric and the EJ26-10P acoustic electric for my acoustic. They have a really full sound, bright highs, and they bend like crazy."
1378,497,4.0,"Folks, I've tried them all from Dean Markley to Ernie Ball.  All have their good and bad points.  But after 22 years of guitar playing, D'Addario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money.  Although I prefer the super light top, regular bottom version, I have always loved the feel, tone and durability of D'Addario strings."
1180,497,3.0,"Been using these for years.  I like the Regular Slinkies, too, but it seems these tend to last longer.  Or, it could just be in my head.  Either way, I am happy with them."
1262,497,4.0,"I've been playing for nearly ten years and I've used all sorts of strings on many different guitars, I've had ball ends pop off for no reason, ball ends rolling around in the bottoms of containers when I've bought them new, and a lot of unnecessary string breakage and fast corrosion, (all top brands) I have also overpaid for fancy gimmicks on strings that are supposed give you magic tones ect. Then I tried D'addario, they just work and work well, I'm not asking for anything magical I just need what I need when I need it and these string have never failed to deliver, I've been using them for over three years now I don't know why I didn't give them a shot sooner, I could have saved a lot of money trying them first. Bottom line is these strings do the job without any drama, giving me more time to just play!"
914,497,3.0,"These bright sounding strings are easy to play, hold up well and rarely break.  One of my favorite strings for my Les Paul.  I tend to go with Ernie Ball Super Slinky's on my Strat, but these would probably sound nice on a Strat as well."
77,497,4.0,"The price was most definately the main draw,I am very glad that I placed the order,these people are pleasant to work with!!!!!"
706,497,4.0,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including, and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion, it looks as if the winding is chipping off, but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
1001,497,4.0,I've been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30+ years.  They always give me consistent results.  I consider them one of the greatest bargains out there.
136,497,4.0,"I love these strings, been using them forever and via Amazon Subscribe and Save I get them for a really good price."
987,497,3.0,"I didn't give 5 stars just because I know there are better strings out there, but these strings are a great value and wouldn't hesitate to buy them again. In fact, I have already bought them several times. One little thing I appreciate about these strings is the different colored ends that makes them easy to identify."
242,497,3.0,"For a good, basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings, it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well, and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating, super brightness, and so on), and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s), but for most purposes these work great, hold their tuning well, and seem to last pretty well, too."
447,497,3.0,"The D'Addario sets are good stuff. I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching, they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them, too) is that there are only a handful of string makers, and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series, and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies, though. With offshore production a standard thing now, it's no telling where they actually come from anyways. I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production, for instance."
539,497,2.0,"D'Addario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried, I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinky's But Found That These Last Longer, The Ernie's Bend and Play Well But They Tend To  Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernie's Start Corroding Within A Week, These D'Addario Strings Stay Brighter Longer, I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks, The Ernie's Only Last Me A Week, 2 Weeks At The Most, That Can Get Expensive Fast, All Around The D'Addario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me, Retraction, when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best, Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings, but they are no longer my preference, A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these D'Addarios. DR's last three times as long as D'Addario. the DR's cost a lil more but they are way better, for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings"
1057,497,4.0,"An opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective.  With that said, I've been stringing my jackson soloist w/ floyd rose with these strings for years.  I've never had a problem, and I wouldn't buy anything else."
757,497,2.0,They are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them. I had earnie ball on previously and I might switch back or go to dunlop witch I put on my 7 sting and love.  But I probably won't get these again..... Ever.
93,497,3.0,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar, i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself, as most guitarists do. Things went alright, but on trying to tune the thinnest string, it broke. I just figured it was something I did, and wasn't the products fault, so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall, i've played quite abit with these strings, and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality, and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
790,497,4.0,como siempre esta marca con sus productos de calidad es un producto 100% recomendado por mi! es superrr bueno!! OK
1309,497,4.0,"These strings have made me a D'Addario customer for life.  The sound and feel are perfect, and I find that they last much longer than more expensive coated strings.  I have no desire to buy any other brand.These strings are NOT over-hyped."
654,497,2.0,"d,addario makes great strings, this just where not the gages I was lookin for.other than that I like this brand of strings"
603,497,4.0,"I've almost exclusively used Earnie Balls and D'addarios since I was a kid,and have always been satisfied. I've taken advantage of Amazon deals on both strings lately. The D'addarios are excellent strings, and this price on the 10-pack was unbeaten,anywhere."
230,497,3.0,"These have good tone, but I can't see much of a difference over other brands at the same price point. I initially experienced buzzing after the string change with these but I needed to adjust the truss rod. Came in a timely manner from Sam Ash. Thanks!"
1040,497,4.0,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using, these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat, even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper, but what can ya do? Besides that, I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
521,497,4.0,"They sound great, and I'd purchase them again. With ten packs, it will likely be a while before I do so."
1304,497,3.0,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company, but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings, so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally, I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time, but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's, so that is also an option for the future."
660,497,4.0,"I've used these since I fist started playing, always trying the latest and greatest along the way, but I keep on coming back to these. They have a great feel to them, sound twangy and great, have decent durability, are cheap as all get out, and have the best multi pack deals out there(especially on Amazon)....I simply don't see any reason to switch atm. Try 'em out, you'll like 'em :)"
331,497,4.0,I bought these to put on my Epiphone Sheraton II. I really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer. Rhythm and lead styles both sound great. Definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future.
931,497,4.0,"D'Addario strings are awesome!  These strings speak with a bold,defined and POWERFUL voice.  The bass strings boom with thunderous lows and the treble strings glisten with sparkling highs without being too harsh.  They are very sweet to the ears and tonally balanced across the board without one frequency overpowering the other. I have tried a lot of different strings, DR's, Ernie Ball, Dean Markley, Elixir, GHS, you name it.  After putting a set of EXL110's (10-46 gauge) on my Gibson SG special faded and comparing them to Ernie Ball I noticed a huge difference, not only were they brighter but they lasted longer.  I used to change a set of Regular Slinkys every two months but with EXL's I was changing strings every five to six months. They work in a variety of applications, metal, hard rock, jazz, blues, reggae, etc. and respond great at any dynamic level.  D'Addario is ""The Player's Choice"" for a reason after using these I can't see myself using anything else!  They feel good,sound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set. If you haven't used them yet, give 'em a try and see what you're missing."
831,497,4.0,"I have been playing guitar for three decades and It seems to me that D'Addario has been around.I use light strings when I want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar.  Light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner, probably because I used them in this manner.  It is great that Amazon stocks these, making ordering convenient.  These come in a stay fresh vacuum pack, so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent."
169,497,3.0,Fits very well on my les Paul 100
1413,497,3.0,"I replaced the factory strings on myDean Playmate Avalanche Junior Solid Body Electric Guitar, Metallic Silver, 3/4 Sizeand what a difference in sound.  These strings seriously rock.  I also use D'Addario strings on my ukulele and I've had great luck with those. They withstand a lot of play and I don't have to replace them often. The best part is, the sound is so much brighter and louder.  Definitely recommended."
428,497,4.0,"If you're a Froosh fan like me, than look no further. These are the strings used by John Frusciante (formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). These strings really are special. They help nail his tone and are slick, light, feel and handle bends perfectly. I use these on my 1962 Strat Reissue and they really compliment the stratocaster well. Highly recommended for those playing blues/funk/rock.Plus, I mean, come on, John mother *&%$#$% Frusciante uses them! :p"
8,497,4.0,The best strings i've ever had so far miles above ernie ball strings
1384,497,4.0,One this is a Long Island Company located in Farmingdale New York. They are the leader in new technology of strings...
819,497,4.0,"For this review, I used the services of my super-musician friend, Mike. Thanks for the very thorough review, Mike!******************D'Addario XL Nickel WoundRegular Light Gauge EXL110Bright Round Wound.010-.046I installed these strings on a Schecter Diamond Serier Acoustic - Electric HybridC-1 E/A in order to test the sound using both acoustic and electric settings. The strings were easy to work with on installation.In particular, I liked the color coding of the strings vs the traditional individuallywrapped strings. The color coding makes it hard to accidentally mix similar strings and ismore environmentally friendly in terms of packaging. Also, the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer.The strings tuned up quickly and reached stable tuning within a very short time frame.After only about an hour they needed only slight tuning adjustment and were ready to go.First, I tried the Hybrid using a clean acoustic setting and the string produced a surprisingly nice range of sound, especially in the lower registers. This was a bit unexpected because of the ""bright"" label on the package. I actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus. The highs were clean and bright.Using the Bernard Butler setting on the Line 6 Amp I tried the electric side of the Hybrid.The action of the strings was light and fast and notes could be comfortably bent. The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar, which leads me to my closing point.Overall, I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around $3,  D'Addario EXL110's will be put in my ""Best Buy"" category for future purchases."
253,497,3.0,"I have been a faithful user of D'Addario strings since a well meaning obsession-starter recommended them to me at a local music store.  Compared to other brands of nickel strings that I've used, these ones just feel ""cleaner"" than the others. They have a clearer sound, and seem to hold their tune better than most.If you're looking for acoustic strings, you can't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity.  But if you're looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean, look no further."
994,497,4.0,"I've been using the D'Addario strings for about 10 years now... US steel, US made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings.  (in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings... little known fact in the industry)  Their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry.  After 40plus years of playing, D'Addario Rocks."
1063,497,4.0,"These are good, quality strings that will last on your guitar for many months to come. Probably my second favorite after Ernie Ball."
615,497,4.0,"These EXL115 .011 gauge D'Addarios are good strings at a good price.  They sound nice and bright on my Epiphone Sheraton II and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale, which I like.  I'd rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time.  The strings don't break either."
911,497,3.0,Great strings at a great price.  These strings have a nice sound to them and they aren't the flimsy little strings you normally get for you guitar.  Nice sound for a nice price...
617,497,4.0,"I love these strings and the price too since I like to change them every time I do a modification to my guitars. Every couple months I change something making ""Upgrades"". They sound Great and stay in tune well."
424,497,4.0,"I usually use 9s, but decided to try these 10s instead. I didn't notice much of a difference at first, but after a while I noticed that it's easier to tune between the G and D string (3rd and 4th strings) because the gauges are closer. Sound is just right for instrumental rock, shredding metal and delivering that Fatal Blow..."
1344,497,4.0,"I use D'addario strings almost exclusively, they make a quality product and at $3 a box shipped to my door when I buy 10 packs is a great deal."
445,497,4.0,I've been playing for 8 years and I own 4 electric guitars.  All of my guitars are strung with D'Addario 10's.  They sound great when they're fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest.  I play at least 15-20 hours per week so I put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings.  It's really the durability that sets these apart.The Amazon price is terrific.  I like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and I can buy a year's worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings.  I'd definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through Amazon.
1159,497,4.0,"As with any Daddario or planet waves product, it's always great quality and has great tone. I've used almost every brand of stings out there, but I always come back to Daddario."
1002,497,4.0,"If you're into playing blues, these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage, they allow you to bend the strigs easier.  I'm not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment, but I'd use these anywhere."
763,497,4.0,Love these strings.  Great for bending and awesome sound.  I don't change strings nearly often enough but with a three pack I can rest assure that I always have a back up set just in case.
1265,497,4.0,"I've been hooked on D'Addarios for quite a while.  The per-unit price on these is great, and I never worry about breaking one of these."
639,497,4.0,"I like these strings. I have had nothing but problems with Ernie Ball strings, especially the higher ones unravelling at the ball ends and breaking as you are tuning up for the first time after a change. I have also found that the Ernie Balls break easily as well. I have had no problems with these, they sound good, feel good, and they are priced right."
1071,497,4.0,"D'Addario always comes through for the musician who wants a great product on the cheap. I've used boutique strings for many years, but always come back to these. Great tone, great string life (with a little maintenance) and very reasonably priced. Loved these as a replacement for the Fender Super Bullets that came on my USA Fender Standard Stratocaster."
780,497,4.0,"I'm a huge fan of D'Addario strings. They hold their tone & tuning longer than others I've tried, and when you buy the bulk packs you can't go wrong on quality + value."
892,497,4.0,"After tons of experimenting, I settled on the EXL116 for D standard and E flat standard. I've tried 10-52 but the top is a little too floppy for D and that makes notes sound out of tune if you don't press the string just right. Also tried 11-56 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone, the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string. That reduces articulation. So while you get a fuller sound with the 56, you get more dynamics and attack with the 52, and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier. You can EQ fullness into a rhythm track, but you can't add in pick attack and greater dynamics.Tension wise, at D standard 11-56 is ideal but 11-52 is doable. Sound wise, 11-52 has been best for my metal recordings and that's why I'm sticking with the EXL116 set from now on. I also replaced the G string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords. And compared to Ernie Balls, D'addarios start off less bright but maintain their brightness longer, thus a more even and predictable response over time."
277,497,4.0,"I use these light guage strings because I have arthritis.  Makes a big difference in how easy it is to play the guitar again.  And if you buy them in a 10 pack, you save a bunch of money!"
294,497,4.0,"Great deal on great strings. They sound clear and bright and they last a good while. Quality strings DO sound different, and nearly as importantly, they feel good too."
970,551,3.0,"I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it.  I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price.  And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits.  Well it fits, but just barely.  The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case.  I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around, facing down, to close the case.  I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position.  I probably wouldn't store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz I'd worry about tension on the strings.  Otherwise I like it."
1101,551,3.0,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside, and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap, and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much, so that's not a problem for me, but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise, it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
1206,551,4.0,"There seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case. One reviewer says it's made by Fender. I seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on. Show me proof. Someone else seems to think it's made by Epiphone. Sorry to disappoint you but Epiphone doesn't make cases. They accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost. I have several Epiphone 335 Dots and a Gibson ES335. I bought Epiphone cases for all of them. I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case. I couldn't see any sense in paying more money just for the Gibson name. My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case. Although the cases have the Epiphone logo on the outside, they are all made by TKL. How do I know that you're wondering? They have a TKL tag on the inside of the accessory compartment. That's been a few years ago. The cases you get now could be made by a different company. The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar. Regardless of who actually makes the case, it has to meet Epiphone's manufacturing standards so it's got to be good. This case will fit The 335 Dot, Casino, Sheraton and the Gibson ES335. Anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II has a much thicker body than the 335 Dot. This case was not intended for the Emperor II. It's a great case and will protect your guitar, but it's not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car. I just bought two more of these cases for my Harmony Rockets. One is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway. Both guitars fit perfectly."
1040,551,4.0,"This Epiphone Hardshell case is a real bargain!  Well built and functional, just the perfect size for your Dot,  Casino, 335 , or in my case a Sheraton II.  Finished in faux leather, a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort, much like the old Fender Tolex.  NICE hardware on this case. All the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid. Hinges too.  The handle isn't going anywhere!  Inside you get a nice soft plush interior, the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things, and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitar.Top all that off with 2 feet on the end for standing upright,  2 well placed feet on the side and 3 on the bottom. NO matter which way you place the case (other than upside down) both your guitar and case are protected.  You get a total of FIVE good quality latches (one of them locks, key included) and hinges at either end. As I said, the hardware on the case is really good.  For under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain.I was immediately struck by how SOLID this case feels.  It is no lightweight either.  I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open, etc.  Mine came almost scuff free out of the box, but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing. Still, it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price.If I could make just two criticisms, it would be that I notice the stitching appears to be single stitched, rather than double stitched. Also, the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented. It is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break.  Also, when you close the case , instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case, necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing.  I would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself.  This is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy, or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroom.I have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon . Overall, I am extremely pleased with this case and my Sheraton II is happy to have found a long term home.  An excellent value, highly recommended!"
122,551,4.0,"great case for my Epiphone Sheraton II! If you own a dot, sheraton, or a 335, you should buy this case! It comes with a key so you can lock it."
1067,551,3.0,"As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned, cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones won't fit Epiphone guitars, as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock. This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove. The padding is perfect, the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar, and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level."
285,551,4.0,Didn't expect much for the price but this is a top notch case for any of the Epiphone - Gibson  Semi-Hollowbody Guitars - Great Deal to protect your investment!!
1084,551,4.0,"When my case arrived I feared it was too small to hold my Epiphone Dot. But, this case fits my Dot like a glove. The case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitar's finish. The accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks, tuner, and extra strings."
630,454,4.0,"Classic design.  I remember these from 35 years ago in high school band.  They haven't changed much, don't fix it if it's not broken."
657,454,4.0,"My son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass (Jazz Band) and his standup bass (Chamber Orchestra). It is solid, yet flexible in height and angle. Assembly was a breeze. This is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use. Built like a tank. Should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family."
577,454,4.0,"This is a heavier duty and higher quality music stand than most. It will accommodate my big notebooks of fake sheets, which I love. Some people have complained about plastic hinges being fragile, but they are fine if you don't use excessive muscle."
871,454,3.0,It's survived my clumsiness and I can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat.
1427,454,4.0,"The M48 is well built, sturdy and well balanced enough that I have no concerns about tipping, even when it is loaded with several music books and a folder of sheet music. The tray is wide with an appropriately sized lip, and is moveable up and down with a moderate effort. Once in place it stays there with no slipping. For all of the solid construction it does not feel heavy and it is easy to move around, although it would be a little awkward to transport it in a small car.This is one of those purchases where there are a number of alternatives, and I always have some concern that it will not be what I want when I get it... in this case it is a winner. Delivered when promised in good condition and appropriately packed."
602,454,4.0,"This is the one you want.  It's a timeless classic, built like a tank, worth every penny.  An investment in your musical future!"
397,454,3.0,"Made in the U.S.A. was a great thing to see. Nothing but Chinese CRAP for sale anymore.(I'm looking at YOU N.A.F.T.A.) Sadly, not as nice as the ones I remember from high school band class.Plastic attachment clutch and EXTREMELY thin gauge metal. Who knows what REAL QUALITY would cost these days?Still, I do feel good knowing that an English speaking, tax paying U.S. citizen got to meet his house payment making these.GOD Bless the U.S.A."
469,607,4.0,tremendous mic!! love the case and shockmount being all inclusive.....got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home/portable studio.....love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic!!! I run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear
1167,607,4.0,There is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voice-over applications. It does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone. NOTE: use a good preamp or a external EQ
239,607,4.0,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say, after researching condenser microphones for several months, countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say, this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;, Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So, think about it, perfect for the amateur, perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
727,607,4.0,"I'll keep this short and simple, I do alot of radio work, and saw the price of this mic of eBay (I wanted to use Paypal) and got it. 60 bucks for something I'd have easily have paid 100+ for, and with the included shockmount, it's a total steal. This obviously won't match top quality condensers, but for speech atleast, I find it to have a wonderful crisp tone with a warm sound to compliment your voice. It just has that smooth radio sound you hear on stations like NPR, which I just love. It sounds fantastic and with a proper interface, possibly the best condenser I've tested that's under 150 bucks."
1321,607,4.0,"this is one of the best mics in this price range. It sounds incredible, and at this price it's unbeatable. I only use three mics, and this is my main vocal, drum overhead, and acoustic guitar mic (although I use two mics on the guitar). My other mic's are a SM57, which is incredible and not crazy expensive, and an Audio-Technica Instrument/Vocal mic. I love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks."
1161,607,4.0,"Again these microphones are made for studio I use it live, again you have to have a good PA System for these to work great. Great microphone if you want to really sound like a real singer, this is the top of the top. Thank you Amazon."
432,607,3.0,"$49 for a $199 microphone at Amazon? May not be the best mic out there but for home studios, this one marks the spot. Get it if you're on a budget."
872,607,4.0,"I love this product. It came fast, included extra shockmount line, shockmount, an adapter, the mic, instructions, and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting. The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables, not 1/4"" cables for Phantom Power), and I couldn't be happier with it. It even looks impressive. Although, I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny, when in reality it is this ""off-silver"" color. Almost a gold, but not quite. It's not bad or anything, just different. And frankly, the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound, that's all that matters. Great product, and extremely affordable. No complaints."
1373,607,4.0,The MXL 990 sounds just as every bit as good as some very expensive mikes I have used. Just like with any condenser mike it's a good idea to invest in a decent pop filter if you don't want those annoying popping P's in your recordings. I would recommend this mike to anyone for vocals or miking acoustic guitars in your recording studio or portastudio. Also a great mike for doing voiceovers.
910,607,4.0,It took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic.  But with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio.
431,607,4.0,man ya'll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it's all good and stuff man. because like when you be spittin some siK leeriX and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me.ay yo let's go.
701,285,4.0,"I have a Taylor GA4E.  The elixir strings that came with it had nice bass, but were very bright.  I tried some martins, ej16's which I love on my Seagull S6.  However, those strings just didn't have enough bass and too much highs.  I bought these recently and I love them.  They are much better then the original strings.  Very rich bass that really comes out.  The highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright.  My one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me.  Anyway, the best sounding strings with the setup I have.  Now off to buy some different bridge materials.EDIT: 9-22-12I also put these on my Seagull Mini jumbo and wow! Every time I come back to it after several weeks, I forget that I put the 600Ls on it.  Then I pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are John Pearse strings.  Worth every penny."
137,285,4.0,"Was very pleased with JP 600L PB acoustic guitar strings. I wipe the strings with a Planet Waves microfiber cloth each time after playing and it seemed like they would last forever. Plus the tone of the bass strings was improved over the D'Addario EJ16 light I had been using that were installed by the factory, so I kept replacing with like kind. 600L is the exact same string gauges.I read a review on Shorline Music (an Amazon affiliate) about the John Pearse 710 NM PB and after trying those I like them even better than the 600L. They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L (A, D, and G) but add some strings from the medium size: low E (.055 replacing .053) and high E and B each increasing .001, from .012 to .013, and .016 to .017.I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position - no problem.The improvement in tone is in all the right places. Very nice. Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total, from the 162.2 lbs. for the D'Addario light.I play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all strings.I suppose things are always subject to change, but for now, I am amazed and delighted with these strings. You wouldn't think a simple string change could make much of a difference, but somehow these do."
154,285,3.0,Everyone has there opinions. I was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of John. What I can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days. They slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time. Sound really nice on my Taylor 410CE.
85,285,3.0,"I usually use Martin SP's, but I decided to give these a try. I'm pleased with them, but I would not rank them above the SP's. I did a little recording with them and I have to admit, they sounded a little brittle."
101,148,4.0,"This is the best one out there BAR NONE  !  Really, this is a keeper.  Wish it came in different neon colors, as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage.  That would make this one the BEST."
395,148,4.0,"Very happy with my new Peg Winder, feels very ergonomic, works well and is nice to use, Thanks for the prompt service and good price .... Cheers !!"
1271,148,3.0,"I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them.  This is no different, it works, I have no issues with the product, if you are looking for a peg winder,  or any accessory, I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
1235,148,2.0,"It works for what it is, it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up.  Not a bad product, just don't know how long it will last."
350,683,4.0,Stable and precise pick attack. Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player. I am buying more gauges too. They last forever.
733,683,4.0,"Great picks, good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it. Very sheep relatives with the quantity."
1196,683,4.0,I ordered 5 different kind of picks and these were my favorite picks. They have a very comfortable feel and great sound!
620,683,1.0,Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well.
1285,327,4.0,"This headstand works like a charm. It's simple, portable, and sturdy. P.s. to the people complaining about it falling over...I have no idea what you're doing with your guitars, but mine is very stable. Plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and I've used just about every brand. For the price, you can't complain."
115,327,2.0,"THis device is ok. It is light weight and folds nicely, but it is not especially stable. Convenient storage is its biggest plus."
15,327,3.0,"A big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass.  Seems sturdy enough.  I side on safety so I use a soft cloth for extra protection, but this item does what it was designed to and should last a long time."
1388,327,4.0,"What a great little stand. I love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings. I also like the fact it folds up, taking up very little space when its stored away. The rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic, so there's no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck."
1177,327,3.0,This gets the job done but because it is lighter you do a bit of &#34;chasing&#34; the guitar around.. All in all gets the job
1333,327,4.0,For those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have.Holds up your insterment while changing strings-- your insterment doest slide around on you. and it folds up. keep it right in your case. very cool tool to have  Thanks
927,327,2.0,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first, it seemed unstable, but then I tried to open it up a little more, and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way, it is relatively stable, and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say, it does fold up nicely, and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars, as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all, I'm happy with the purchase, as it suits my needs."
689,327,4.0,"great little tool to assist you while replacing strings, cleaning or tuning, keeps headstock still and then folds up neatly to fit in a drawer, kit or pocket"
964,327,4.0,Works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar.  Compact enough that it's able to be stored in your case if you want or if you have a tech box that you bring with you.
757,327,4.0,"It makes restringing way easier it's pretty stable and sturdy. It will work on pretty much any guitar. So far iv used it on my 6,7 electrics and my Taylor acoustic."
983,327,4.0,"This is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as I do.  I've tried other types including those that I made myself but I much prefer this one.  I find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars...from Fender, Takamine, Ovations...etc. For the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling. Highly recommended."
3,327,4.0,Sweet little neck stand.  Very light weight.  Folds compact to fit in your guitar's hard case or gig bag.  Padded to protect guitar neck.
1031,327,4.0,"In the case of you change the guitar strings, or in case you just make a revision setup, this item is very useful, because the guitar will be land and the her body will stay firmly attached."
402,327,2.0,"I was expecting something a little bigger. It will do, but next time, I probably will look for something with a little more stability."
876,327,4.0,"This was very convenient, easy to use, weighs next to nothing and takes even less space than I had expected. Recommended."
277,327,3.0,"I do all my own guitar maintenance, which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings, etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose, but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So, looking around on Amazon, I found this handy little device.  It's small, works well, and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong, it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
538,151,4.0,"I ordered these picks in bulk to use while I was recording/producing. I absolutely love these picks and swear by them. I've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that I landed on years ago and stuck to. I've had years of lessons, licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me! Perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for Rhythms. I'd order again if I had to."
747,151,4.0,"I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing, and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 3.00mm picks.  Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I won't ever be without one.  Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that I'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises."
42,151,3.0,"This pick is so good to play electric guitar! It is heavy and small, what gave us attack. Make the sound clean and bright."
417,151,3.0,"I always use the 1.00mm for guitar, had to test them with bass strings... they turn out to be great!"
263,151,4.0,"These are the thickest picks I've ever used.  However, I am really liking them.  The tone they give seems better to my ears than anything I've tried and my speed picking has improved."
1240,151,4.0,"I've tried every standard pick - even bone, silver & really expensive ones. These little Dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite - and they're cheap! Great on guitar and also *awesome* on mandolin. They are small, which takes getting used to, though.Play with the round side for a fat tone. Play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone."
1418,151,4.0,"I bought these thinking they were the normal sized BIG stubby picks, obviously they weren't. They're as sturdy as the BIG ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me. I still think Amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information, but it's still not too bad."
427,728,4.0,"I bought this to tote my POD HD500 around.  It fits snugly, but well.  The accessory pocket can fit the power supply and the plastic Line 6 expression pedal.  The shoulder strap makes me feel important.  it respects my arm's desire for freedom of movement.  My only qualm is that it's Gator brand, and gators remind me Florida.  I'd rather just pretend that Florida didn't exist."
1292,728,4.0,"I purchased this case for my newLine 6 POD HD 500. It's a well built, solid case for the price. It fits the HD 500 very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables. I wouldn't drop my POD in this thing, but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well."
197,728,3.0,"I bought this specifically for a GT-100. It fits, snuggly, almost like it was designed for it. There is enough room in the front pocket for the power supply, input and output cables and maybe a little more. I was also able to put a 3/4&#34; binder in on top of the GT-100 which sort of protects the screens and knobs a bit more, and provides a place for the stupid lead sheet binder than never fits in my other cases.This bag is a good size as just an accessory bag to carry along with a guitar and a combo amp if you have a couple pedals and cables, or some odds and ends you want to bring along.Pros--------Looks like the same basic quality as my other gator bags-GT-100 Fits like a snug glove (with just a little use it will be perfect)-Front pocket- Reasonable priceCons-------- They cost reduced their logo from a thread stiched logo to a cheap vinyl like silk screen or iron on patch. (unlike product photo) and it doesn't match all my other gator bags. Not a big deal, but worth mention.- Other similar gator bags I own have a wrap around padded handle that velcros the two handles together once the bag is closed. This does not.Overall good product, but would have liked that other padded wrap around handle and the &#34;non cost reduced&#34; logo."
1311,728,4.0,"Mine came flattened in a little box.  I wasn't happy that its form was deformed.  Well in a few days it popped back into shape so I didn't have to ship it back.  A good sign!I am using it for both some music and computer stuff.  The bag is well made considering its price.  You cannot even get a backpack for this price.  I love its depth.  A number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded.  This is a solid 4""+ depth and cozy padding around it for protection.  Be sure to check out all the dimensions though.  Its very long - I was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it.  I think I saw ""micro"" and thought shorter.Not only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer / electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack.  I'm thinking of getting another because of this.The only minus is that I wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder / paper slot.  But these are just wish list items.  Finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited.  Lucky this is a good option."
1424,728,4.0,This bag works perfectly for the Digitech RP 1000 or pedals of the same size. I also use it for an older Digitech pedal and works like a charm. The construction seems to be sturdy and so far I' ve had no problems with the zippers. The side pocket is very convenient to store lines and plugs and the handles are very comfortable. Very good product.
1119,728,3.0,A snug fit for the POD HD 500. Knocked one star off because the weight distribution is a little awkward when using the strap on my shoulder.
1414,898,3.0,"Works great for my acoustic dreadnought.If I had any complaint it would be that there's nothing to prevent the lower part of the guitar from banging against the wall. It would be nice if they had an option for something that could hang down off the hanger - a little cushion - that would go between the wall and the guitar. No reason I can't make something like that on my own, though.Edit - 9/24/2013 - Just got my first classical guitar and realized that the wider neck won't fit into this hanger. Nothing worth complaining about, but just something to note - if you need a hanger for a classical guitar, this isn't it."
725,898,2.0,This is a really nice item and I got two of them.  Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble.  That's the problem with mail order. Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it. Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical (beater) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one.  The other unit seems to be rock solid. Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar.
511,898,4.0,"This Guitar Hanger is good looking, well made, and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet, and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH"
863,898,4.0,"i bought one, then i bought two more, then i bought two more.these things are well made (in the good ol' US of A), look good, and are a deal.  none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall, which is good, right?"
168,898,4.0,"Perfect for hanging displaying your guitars.  Very sturdy, they hold up well to both my Bass or guitar without moving or flexing (both are on the heavy end).  I own 3 now, and will definitely buy more if I expand my collection!"
359,898,4.0,"I like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe.  I bought 2 of these and have had them for a year now and they have yet to let me down.  My daughter still gets to them and tries to pull them off but she has yet to succeed.  Very solid constriction. I like that they pivot so if my daughter pulls them to the left or the right, the piece moves with it and returns it back to balance once she is finished.  Excellent design."
1130,898,4.0,Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.
140,898,4.0,"I bought 2 of these and will order a few more.  They are very nice looking and functional too.  I have been keeping my guitars in floor stands or in their cases but it takes up much needed space and just creates clutter...not that a guitar should EVER be considered clutter.The GREAT thing about these is that your guitar(s) are always &#34;right there&#34; and you can choose whichever one you have a hankering to play at that moment.Just a note of caution though.  Make CERTAIN that you mount the hanger screwed into a stud or on a solid wood surface.  The weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock.  Included are sheet rock plastic backers but personally I would not trust them and nobody wants a hole in their wall.  I would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well.  I'm sure the screws are okay but I wouldn't trust them myself.I would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many.  Well worth the small price paid.  The shipping was incredibly fast too, as always with Amazon."
657,898,4.0,"The perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar. My daughter loves it. Instrument looks great on her wall, and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice. Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws (or mount to wall studs)."
472,898,3.0,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas, but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks, depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood, really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
117,898,4.0,This not the first Swing Hanger I have. They are great You will love it. Our Son has four or more of them too.
1133,898,4.0,This hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar.  It holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall.
185,898,4.0,I have too many guitars and don't play them all so instead of buying an extra case or stand I figured I could use some wall decoration.  This works perfectly and is easily installed with two screws.  Definitely recommend.
852,898,4.0,Works like the picture shows.  Hangers adjust to required width of head stock.  Wood finish is nice look on the wall.
236,898,2.0,These hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws.  The screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so I would recommend you buy some good screws before you install.  I have several of these and at least three screws broke as I screwed them into the stud in the wall.
14,898,4.0,"Stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time. These hangers are easy to install, just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business. The stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe."
673,898,4.0,Some people are not comfortable using the drywall anchors that are included with this hanger. If the drywall anchors are installed correctly you will have no worries about it pulling out of the drywall. I have used these drywall anchors for 10 years now to hang heavy wood blinds which are raised and lowered daily without anchor failure. Concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger. The only options are the drywall anchors. They are good to go.
1356,898,3.0,"I have two of these.  They hold a variety of guitars just fine.Since the blocks are square, make sure you get them aligned with a wall or ceiling so they don't look crooked.  They seem to come from a variety of wood - mine are not a matched set even though I ordered two of the same part.  They have different wood grains."
1183,898,4.0,I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost.
1185,898,4.0,"I bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room. It looks really good, almost like an ornament. It sturdy and good quality. 5 stars."
1025,898,4.0,"I installed this in two minutes. I was planning on just using my twist-n-lock drywall anchors I bought at home depot to install some shelving recently but that's what it actually came with. These anchors are great. I used an 11/64 drill bit for the pilot holes. Don't use a bigger bit. It might be tempting to use a 1/4"" drill bit if you're thinking of the push in type drywall anchors. That would be a mistake. These are better and screw in. I used a manual ratchet screwdriver. The anchors go flush with the wall then you screw the wood screws into the center of the screw head and through. I recently installed several shelves in two apartments (a friend saw mine and wanted some too) and these are the anchors I used. Of course a stud is better and also if your drywall is already crumbling that's no good. For a typical well maintained house or apartment though this should be fine even without a stud. I have a Schecter five string bass hanging from it and I'm confident that's not going to pull out from gravity. A heavier screw would still work and add confidence than the one packaged. One such as the screws packaged in actual twist-n-lock anchors. Looks nice. Decent price."
1423,898,4.0,"This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar. Comes with everything you need (except a drill or a screwdriver of course). It is pretty and very strong. I originally purchased it to hang on drywall (sheetrock) for my 5 year old's mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar, which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock. This is a good buy."
151,898,4.0,"We bought three of these and they are just great. Mounting holes are drilled right, screws pass right through and fit perfectly. Comes with big, beefy drywall anchors and feels just right. Holds the guitar out at a safe distance. Highly recommend this over the other (way cheaper looking) ones that are a few bucks less. Spend the extra few bucks on these and SMILE."
1064,898,4.0,This design is a big improvement over string swings' past designs head stock fits snugly in the well made cradle.  quality wood constructtion and the rubber material used feels nice to the touch.  I will buy more if I get another guitar.
362,898,4.0,"I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars, banjos, and mandolins.They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.Very sturdy, well made product."
636,898,4.0,"I have been fortunate to build a small, but decent collection of acoustic and electric guitars in a room dedicated to music. All 15 of my guitars are hanging on the walls and in the 15 years I've been using String Swings I've never had a problem with them. They hold every guitar, regardless of neck shape or style. Since they swivel, my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks. The depth is adjustable, so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics. While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars, I didn't want to take a chance, so I use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar's finish. I try and screw them into studs to support the weight, and where I can't do it, I hang some of my lighter guitars, but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure... although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens. I also strongly recommend (as others have done) that you run a humidifier in the room housing your guitars (40-50% humidity is perfect). I recommend the HoneywellHoneywell HCM-6009 QuietCare 9-Gallon Output Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology"
438,898,4.0,"I just finished installing 12 of these and couldn't be any happier with the product.  It is a sturdily built product with EVERYTHING you need for installation.  I didn't think this was possible, but I actually found a product MADE IN THE USA !!!  I will definitely buy more of these as my guitar collection grows.I did NOT have the mis-matching color issue that others commented on - all I did was contact the seller (in my case Brook Mays Music) and ask if it was at all possible for them to closely match these since all 12 are going on the same wall.  They were extrememly responsive, even sending two emails concerning my request (basically saying they would do their best - but no promises).  Well, Brook Mays came through for me & I received (very quickly I might add) 12 of these that matched perfectly !!!  I will definitely go out of my way to use this seller again.Another great experience purchasing items through the Amazon site !!!"
602,898,4.0,"This is a very simple product, but one which fulfills its intended purpose of hanging guitars on the wall.  This fits all my guitars from telecaster to classical neck widths.  The swivel mount is key to keeping excessive stress off of the neck."
1069,898,4.0,Love these. They're sturdy . Which is very important and was my biggest concern since my guitars are pretty heavy. They look so cool on the wall and everyone compliments and noticed my guitars now. Love this so much. Highly recommended
1208,898,4.0,I had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so I had to get another for my acoustic. Super simple to install and very sturdy once installed.
760,898,4.0,Very nice guitar hanger easy to install and it floats away from the wall (the back of the guitar never touches the wall)
124,898,4.0,"When placing my guitar in a stand on the floor I always worry that someone (person or dog) will knock it over.  This hanger works great for hanging my guitar out of the way, safe and secure.  Yes, I could put it in the case, but when I'm playing on and off all day long that becomes cumbersome, so this hanger is convenient and secure for my beloved guitar."
1198,898,4.0,"I bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and I found them to be extremely simple and quick to install.  The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wall.If you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures, so I will have to do new pictures, but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.The easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theBlack & Decker BDL100AV All-In-One SureGrip Laser Leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.As far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.I DO NOT, however, recommend buying theString Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.EDIT: I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes.  The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  Just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.  At any rate, you do not need to drill pilot holes; just nail and go!"
172,898,4.0,"Works Great! Its a good product, Just what i expected. I expect to buy more of these in the future. And for its price its well worth it!!!"
1081,231,3.0,Holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness. I stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by.
45,231,0.0,I might have done something wrong...I read in a review that these hold six picks.It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...I'll just keep using my pockets.
166,231,4.0,This pick holder works for me. It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed. It fits my Jasmine well. Buy it from GO-DPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products!
170,231,4.0,this product works just fine..spring loaded...so load the picks up...wish they would hold a couple more...but im happy...i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have...enjoy
1,231,4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for to go into my case or my pocket. I will not put this on the back of my guitar but you do have the option. Perfect fit for medium picks. Ease of use, and durable. Have purchased another one! Good deal!"
388,231,2.0,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick, as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case, but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder, and if you use something other than the standard shape, forget it.  It has an adhesive backing, so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal, but I'd rather not."
688,231,0.0,"Man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money... ug!"
737,231,3.0,It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok.  The tapered design might be to make picks eject easier?  I never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to.  Except.  I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars.  These are good don't get me wrong.
1141,231,2.0,"I'm rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR (4) picks into it when it snapped apart. I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.0 mm picks and perhaps that's where I was at fault - I maybe should left it at three picks.However, my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely. Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holder.I give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated."
1411,231,4.0,Yet another awesome low cost guitar accessories from Jim Dunlop put the picks where you need them literally anywhere you need them stick it to the ceiling  if you got to
511,231,3.0,"This Dunlop ""Ergo Pickholder"" is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy, especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick, you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
594,231,3.0,I purchased this pickholder for my son who has a nasty habit of leaving things in places they don't belong.  The holder keeps his picks in a place he is sure to find.  Best purchase I have made.
758,231,2.0,"it hold my picks well, but some are to big for it and the tape/foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly. im neutral on this one."
682,231,4.0,"Genius concept. It works for me perfectly. I no longer lose or misplace my picks. Easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in. It'll depend on  where you decide to place this Pickholder, I placed mine right above the jack plug"
34,231,2.0,"I own three of these, and have them attached to the back of my headstocks. Great idea, great concept and great quality. Only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that I have recently adopted. Dunlop Jazz III, the Dunlop Max-Grip Jazz IIIs and my Dava Jazz picks just won't stay in there without slipping out.For regular sized picks, it's a perfect product. For smaller sized picks I improvise by using SD card cases -- perfect fit for jazz picks."
140,231,4.0,"I love this little item.  I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it.  No more hunting for picks anymore.  When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it's always there when I pick up the guitar.Placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar.  I placed mine where I'd never rub against it, between the amp cord inlet and a control knob.  Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it.I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too, only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar.Oh, I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in, but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.  This is a must have item, in my opinion."
1339,231,0.0,"I use Clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. My picks don't fit!!! If I shove them in, I can't get them out. Also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck."
261,231,4.0,This pick holder is pretty awesome. It's nice to have a place for picks on the guitar. If you're anything like me I always keep a pick in the strings up by the neck of the guitar. NOT ANYMORE! They now sit in this beautiful little pick holder attached to my guitar!!!
1170,231,2.0,"It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless. It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy, also the thicker the pick, the fewer it will hold. It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot. I've found it mostly not useful thus far, maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there."
426,231,4.0,"This is a very good pickholder by Dunlop and looks much nicer than the regular Dunlop 5000 or 5005 - It does what it should and looks more esthetical than the Dunlop 5000 or 5005 versions. It does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005. It actually holds a couple of picks less. It holds some 4 or maybe 5 picks while the 5005 holds around 7 (if you use 0.60. gauge picks or lower). I did the test just for the heck of it with several picks. Since I use the Planet Waves Chrome Dome stainless steel picks (Joe Satriani), I only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one I am playing with, so for me it does the job perfectly. I have a nice 2013 Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top, so I needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it. The adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitar's top if placed as instructed. Place it gently, no need to press it too hard. Alean the surface very well before placing but do not use carnauba or any polishing material or gel before installing - Just regular guitar top cleaner (I use the PRS cleaner for example). Cheers!"
912,231,4.0,I seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and I have great access to it. Fantastic.
471,231,4.0,I have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder. You can stick it to the guitar. Is light and cheap.Go for it.
498,231,2.0,"Does what it is designed to do, it holds about 6 picks.  Small piece of adhesive tape on the back. The supplier refunded some of the postage.  Amazon promised to credit my account $10 (credit never appeared) for the highly inflated shipping costs.  A $2 item cost $17.70 for shipping!  Be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order."
30,231,4.0,"As with all Dunlop products this pickholder is fair priced and functional.  It does what it is intended to do, holds my picks!  It actually works well.  The picks go in and come out nicely."
879,231,4.0,"Every once in awhile, while browsing through Amazon, I come across something I don't know how I got along without!! And it really works!"
389,231,2.0,"In my humble opinion, the pictures make the product look purple.  They're not purple.  At least the ones I was sent.  They were charcoal.I bought them specifically to use with my daughter's purple Washburn guitar, so it's kind of annoying.Other than the color, there's nothing wrong with them."
1228,231,2.0,"I quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something I would use but as I said, It's ok."
26,231,4.0,"this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks, you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them"
1283,231,4.0,"Nice, holds picks better then my old one, and best of all... It comes with one free disintegrating pick! It is really awesome, all you have to do is alt-pick in 16th, and watch it dissapear before your very eyes! Lol, great product though."
1316,231,3.0,Nice little device.  We'll see how long it lasts (a cheap little plastic thing really) but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue.  I use it with the medium dunlop picks.  Glad I got it.
452,231,4.0,"I hated having to put the pick between strings.  And now that I have a ton of picks, I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish, and I dont want to ruin it.  But the instructions say it should be fine.  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well, still deciding on that.  But for the price you pay for this, it's a no brainer for any musician."
329,231,4.0,Good-sized holder. I placed it between the tuners & it fits like it was made for that spot which is out of the way most of the time. Just enough tension to hold the picks & not too strong to to make it hard for me to remove them. Highly recommended.
1185,231,4.0,"This little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere (wallet for example), and lets you securely carry many picks with you. I tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks, but it doesn't. I'm not complaining about it, but I think it would be a nice extra.Great buy!"
414,231,4.0,it holds about 6 to 7 picks.  pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate.  would recommend.
1031,231,4.0,"It is really the best pick holder i ever had. I can put 6, 7 picks on it. It says very tight on the headstock and its visual is superb, I recommend."
687,231,4.0,"It's actually sleek looking and although I didn't have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar, it's a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there. It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and I'm sure I'll lose a lot less picks because of it! It's almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing..is that weird to say? Just buy it already!"
225,231,4.0,I have ordered several of these - like 6 or 7.  I love them.  They are great for holding picks & make wonderful gifts.
119,231,4.0,"Simple, but elegant in size for placement in a guitar case. This a great device to put my genuine 'Planet Waves' signature picks in. Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'"
637,231,4.0,"I always lose my damn picks, this helps. Hopefully I don't lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there!"
1423,231,4.0,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had, has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time, they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store, or for how long, the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks, this is the product for you."
1205,231,4.0,"It's just unbelievable how well this device holds picks.  I mean, you just insert your guitar picks in this device and BAM - it holds them!  No further action is necessary! And when you need a pick - you just pull one out, and there it is!What will they think of next?"
398,231,4.0,"Had no issues in the 2 months. There is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your 'real' picks, which helps with its looks."
238,231,4.0,"I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body.  People watching me can't really see it, and it's right where I need it, full of picks, if I drop one.  Wonderful little invention.  Buy it, if you don't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket."
428,231,4.0,"If you're always dropping picks, losing picks, breaking picks, this is perfect to have. Fits about 5-8 guitar picks or so. Stickies onto your guitar, wherever. There seems to be enough sticky-ness to move it around a few times and still have ti grip like new."
716,231,4.0,Great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks. It does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice. It does not take up much room & it sure feels good to have extra picks close by so that you do not have to scramble to find another one.
592,231,4.0,Love the holder and the picks looke great and nice  and I don't have to look around for my picks when I'm ready to play my guitar
287,231,3.0,The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument.
883,231,4.0,I store my picks in there and I put it by my table. It's a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done.
833,231,3.0,"This is fine as a general stick-on inexpensive pick holder. It doesn't hold very many picks, but it really doesn't have to. I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chain/pick holder over this. It costs more but has more functional value to me. If all you need is something very simple, and you have a surface you can stick it on, then this is fine."
232,231,4.0,"I lose picks constantly. Years ago I resorted to placing them between the srings in the neck of the guitar when Im not playing it. That of course leads to bent picks and still, lost picks. This thing is great. I load it up with alternating  (hard and soft) picks so I can easily swap out between songs. Best $3 I've ever spent."
124,231,4.0,"I bought this so I can keep some extra picks handy... now if I can just decide where to adhere it, to my guitar or my music stand?  Or to the desk where I sit and play?  Maybe I should just get one for each spot and each instrument...  Yeah, I think a few of these would be nice."
37,231,4.0,it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks. It does exactly what it says it does. its also very cheap.
215,231,3.0,"Designed to accommodate most ""standard"" shaped guitar picks, this Dunlop pick holder is handy little spring loaded device, for storing picks.  You can mix brands and types, but how many picks can fit inside, will vary from around three, to perhaps a dozen.  As a guide, about 10 Dunlop 0.60mm nylon picks will fit, but only 4 Dunlop 1.50mm Delrin picks.  Even thick irregular picks like the Dunlop 3.0 Big Stubby will fit, however the total number will be greatly reduced.Build quality is good, but forcing too many picks inside, could cause the spring to fail, or the seam to split.  A piece of double stick tape, shaped to match the pick holder, is included.  The tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place.  I stuck mine on the backside of the headstock of my guitar, and while it stays in place, it's pretty wobbly.Color options at this time seem to be limited to black, but if you have DIY skills, you could paint it whatever color you like.  This is a decent buy, below the two dollar level.  I prefer this model over theDunlop 5505 pick holder, because it seems to be sturdier, and I like the more rounded appearance."
1380,416,0.0,Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly. Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks
510,416,4.0,"What can I say?  It's a cable.  It's cheap, and it works as advertised.  Much less expensive than what they try to force on you at the local music shops.  Gold tips, yeah, right!"
489,416,4.0,"Nice one, small, soft, cheap cable with comfortable lenght. Nothing else I can say :)Take it for cheap guitars."
703,416,4.0,"I've used several different kinds of guitar cables, and I've finally settled on planet waves cables. From patch cables to guitar cables, I simply trust this company. In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android, there really isn't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence. So in that regard, I prefer planet waves cables. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. Highly recommended!"
388,416,4.0,"It has what you want in a cable, and not what you don't.  Not insanely priced from having pixie gold dust sprinkled over it, but quiet and supple and uses good quality plugs on both ends.  So there it is; nothing magical, just a guitar cable."
583,416,3.0,"these cables are nicely constructed. i bought them for home use only. home recording or just practicing.they seem to work well so far. i wouldnt gig with these on a regular basis, but for home use, with littleabuse, they should last."
1022,416,4.0,"The Planet Waves Classic Series 10ft Instrument Cable is basic, but works great and is very flexible.  Seems sturdy enough to last a long time."
608,416,4.0,"I have many Planet Waves cables.  They all work well, are well constructed and are a good value.  I would highly recommend any Plant Waves Cables."
1024,416,4.0,"I've purchased many of these cables and I'll be getting more eventually. Cables, even good ones, eventually break. These are quite flexible, seem durable, and are by a brand name. If you need cables, these work great."
1210,416,3.0,First of all I liked the fact that it came coiled in a circular coil instead of the bow tie pattern that leaves bends through out the lenght of the cord.  The jacks are sealed in rubber and provide stress relief. It sounds ok for the price.
715,416,4.0,I purchased the Planet Waves 10 Ft Instrument cable for our son to hook up his electric guitar to his amplifier. It works well...no connectivity issues whatsoever. Highly recommend.
1127,416,3.0,It's a bit thinner than the average cable.Not as thick as I would like but works well and its kind of nice and slick to put away. Very smooth.
888,416,4.0,I think these are the same as the pricey monster cables and half the price.  I will buy Planet Waves from now on.
113,416,4.0,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats, and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality, since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10', 1/4"" mono (tip)"
257,416,4.0,I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth.I like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std. Telecaster input jack great.The flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked. These do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage. I have more expensive cables but rather use these.
1172,416,3.0,"I really like this cord, it rolls easy, its long, and its got a great powdery feel to the material. I suggest having multiple of these so length wont be a problem, got 6 of'em myself, all sound great, (Right angle or Straight).Great buy, cant go wrong here."
492,416,4.0,"This cable is dirt cheap, but the quality seems to be just fine.  I am using it for my primary rig setup and I can't tell the different between this and some other cables.  Recommended."
972,416,4.0,These cables are just what I hoped they would be. They work well on my electric and my acoustic. Happy guy here Thanks
804,416,4.0,"I've come to the point where anytime I buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves. They are good quality, decently priced, and I don't have to worry about them shorting out on me. Definite buy."
825,416,4.0,No problems at all with this product.  Works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from Amazon.  I would recommend this product.
411,416,4.0,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive, yet lightweight, flexible, and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness, which feels nice at first and feels ""more studio,"" but when you're actually using the cable, it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance, Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more, I prefer Pro Co Excellines, since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler, just call Sweetwater), which feels nicer to me, but I like these just fine."
515,416,0.0,"Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk."
1379,416,3.0,"WOW,if you need a guitar cable this is it...it's metal on the tips and long and black in the body (like a long snake with shiny ends) no, it works just fine and just long enough for my playing...if you have a guitar and amp you will need this...even without a guitar and an amp it's still fun to have!!!&#60;&#60;&#60; be warned this review may not help you...so go on to the next, if you need too&#62;&#62;&#62;"
1101,416,3.0,"I plugged in the amp, and I plugged in the bass, and there were no issues with the wire.  This is one of those products you don't want to overly notice, and in that it has done the job is is designed for."
241,416,0.0,"I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,,"
408,416,4.0,"Simply, these are great cables. They snap right in, carry sound well, and come with a lifetime warranty. The 15' length is just about right, and at about one dollar per foot a good value. Recommended."
872,416,3.0,"I haven't used the cable yet, but it looks new and durable. The cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what I expected. Can't wait for the rest of my gear to get here so I can do a sound test. Based on physical condition, I would recommend this product."
377,416,3.0,"A simple affordable instrument cable. I prefer cable ends that are formed (not the type which can be unscrewed), as there is less risk of breakage and noise. Cable quality is not high (for professional recorded you'll something better), but very good in general."
292,416,3.0,"cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use. Still highly recommended for the money,"
1249,416,4.0,"Great sound quality, meets full expectations. Cable is very flexible and also seems strong and good physical quality. It's worth spending a few extra dollars on a good quality cable rather than to buy other crappy cables."
447,416,1.0,"This was bought based on the advice of others. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker."
138,416,4.0,Best inexpensive right angle cables out there. I use these in my lesson room at the music store that I teach at. They will last forever if you take care of them.
652,416,4.0,I wanted something inexpensive and well made and decided to go with Planet Waves over the similarly priced Fender cable. I like it because the tip is one piece instead of screw on and the price was just right. When I have to replace this cable I will likely buy this same cable or something else by PW because of all the cables I have owned PW seems to withstand my abuse most effectively.
122,416,4.0,This cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. Would like to purchase another one in the future. Buy it! it's worth it
660,416,4.0,"I've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count. It's hard to find a tough, low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere, but this one is the best one out there for the price paid. Its made well, with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love. I use it for all of my equipment connections, and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect. Try it out, you'll discover the same as me and my band mate's have, that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon!"
99,416,2.0,"Not the greatest cord I have ever used, not the worst either. I would prefer Fender Tweed cables over this one if I had to make a recommendation."
516,416,4.0,"I ordered these as both a spare and to use with my lower end keyboard (a Casio PX-320) so I could leave my expensive Roland RD-300NX in my home studio. Much to my surprise this cable is pro quality. It's as noise free as myMonster Rock 21' Instrument Cable, and I cannot tell the difference between the two cables when I am using this one with either or my keyboards. The remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the Monster model.I'll give the Monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction, but where it matters - signal transmission - I frankly cannot tell the two apart. Part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise. And I am sure that the oxygen-free copper conductor also has something to do with it. Both the every expensive Monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction.I love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the Monster. It does a better job of holding flex to a minimum, although the connectors on the Monster are a better quality.Bottom line: the Monster cable wins out in few places, but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk. In fact, I will probably keep the Monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging. For one thing, there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one, and for another this costs a fifth of what I paid for the Monster. Even if you insist on using the more expensive cables, this is a great one to have as a spare."
293,416,4.0,"I own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them. I use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage.The ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very 'slinky', i.e. not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be.And a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price."
626,416,4.0,"Its solid. Has great quality. & doesn't short out on you. I had it for a few months now & not a tear anywhere in site Planet Waves printed on the cord ""guaranteed for life"" i think they mean it XD"
814,416,4.0,"Solid, reliable and rocks.Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it. Nothing else to say. Thanks."
1231,416,4.0,"Very good sound and quality.  I am not a professional guitarist, so these cables will do just fine for me."
615,416,4.0,"I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp, will not kink up on itself, does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with, a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy, and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection, and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster."
1196,416,4.0,"The Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 5 feet is a very well pro made cable that has always been exactly what I needed."
845,416,4.0,"What can one say about a cable?They are intended to transmit electrical impulse with the least amount in interference and this one does a superb job of just that.Why I have been thinking of replacing all of my other cables with additional cables just like this one, only slightly longer or a good deal shorter depending on the intended function."
588,416,4.0,I love the fit and the sound quality. It doesn't come loose or wiggle once in place. I'll get this one again!
1240,416,3.0,"A good cable for the money. Could have better stress release, but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value."
1235,416,4.0,"I was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is.  I really like the right angle plug for my amp, it doesn't make the wire 'stick out' like a straight plug would.  Good stuff."
1106,416,0.0,Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.
620,416,0.0,The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.
548,416,3.0,It does what I need to get my bass and guitar to the amp. Probablly not much use being only five feet in length for a gig or show but since I am only rocking out in my house it's no big deal.
1215,416,4.0,"This same chord was almost 30 bucks in a regular store it just had a different name on it, sounds great and you won't trip all over the place while rocking out, so get one today."
294,416,4.0,"Always high quality for a reasonable price. More durable than the cheap cables you find online and less expensive than the 'boutique' cables.. Great working-man's gear. Not so cheap that you can't rely on them, not so expensive that you can't buy a number of extras."
816,416,4.0,It came in nice packaging.Cable looks great - feels of high quality.So far it still works well.10 ft is nice for home.If you're a performer... longer is required.
370,224,4.0,When you're just starting to purchase equipment and are on a budget look into Plant Waves line up of cables and such.They offer good middle of the road accessories. Even high end also. Check them out they carry OK equipment. These mic. cables are working really well for me. Highly recommended.
1294,224,4.0,What can i say?  this is a xlr cable.i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables.This one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road.So buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest!
730,224,4.0,Quiet and durable
571,224,4.0,"These cables are flexible without feeling cheap, and have solid end connectors. And, they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do, which is why I replaced them. I suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come, which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision. These mics cords have solid construction going for them, without the high dollar cost."
1081,830,4.0,"Firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick. They are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold, I can play all night without dropping it."
1094,830,4.0,Depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes.  That comes in handy.  They make another version which is less pointy...I like that one a little bit better.
372,830,4.0,"Elderly pickers like me fumble conventional picks onto the floor, particularly when the skin is dry during winter. The grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that. The material used for the core gives a slightly softer tone than the Fender mediums I have used for 50 years. I like the graduated feel these picks have, with a slight give in the center, allowing the player to vary the pick attack between strumming and picking single notes."
1155,830,4.0,"These are good picks,  I've tried all the other gel pick's and plastic pick's,  The gel pick's  come close,But these are great, Because I have Dexterity Problem's, and the plastic/rubber grip Is perfect............I do still have a little Trouble with controlled the pick and droping the pick  but they definitely do help.I def Do recommend these to anyone who was deceased/bad dexterity."
203,830,4.0,"I used to think a pick was a pick, with the only difference being stiffness. (I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness). The only problems I had with ""regular"" picks was: (1) them slipping in my hand (turning around), (2) out of my hand (on the floor), and, of course, (3) breaking. I decided to give the Dava picks a try. I bought a pack of the ""jazz"" picks and a pack of these ""grip tips"". I really thought I'd like the jazz picks better: that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick. But, after trying them both, I find these (the grip trips) are now my ""pick of choice"". They fit my grip perfectly, stay put in my hand, and give me maximum control when I play, whether it's lead or rhythm. I have yet to break one. I'm mainly buying another set because I've given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available. I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations, so whenever I pick up a guitar to play, I've got one close by (also always keep a spare in my wallet). Bottom line is, for me at least, these picks are tops! Sure I can still use a regular pick when that's all that's available. But why not use the best when I can???Update: Been using these picks for a year since my first review. Still love them. Still have yet to break one (and I can be an aggressive strummer). The only reason I need to buy more: I lose them. I have to admit they are a bit pricey, compared to other picks. But for me, they are still tops. Which is why I'm buying another half dozen."
627,830,4.0,I have tons of picks and these are well made and easy for me to hold in my hand without slipping around too much.
1088,830,4.0,"I absolutely LOVE these picks. Grips really well in your hand, plays like a dream. I just wish more came in the pack. I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone if they want some great picks."
362,830,1.0,These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas. Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play.
833,830,4.0,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks, but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks, but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide, but with Dava you get a great grip."
978,830,4.0,"I have been playing guitar off/on for about 30 years. I have always used whatever cheap picks I could find laying around or snagged from music shops -- the free ones they give you when you try out a guitar in the shop :) Always Medium gauge, for both acoustic and electric. I decided to try these Dava 1303's because they were cheap and looked cool, wasn't expecting much, I mean, a pick is a pick, right? Wrong. These little guys have a fantastic ""feel"" to them; they seem to get in between the strings so effortlessly for flat picking. It's crazy but that is what I am experiencing. They are maybe a bit on the thin side, but not overly so, I got used to them quick. Plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking. Tone-wise, they produce a nice, crisp, slightly metallic string sound which I rather like. I recorded some with them today and it was perhaps a bit on the loud side with regards to the audible pick attack on the strings on the acoustic (a Breedlove C25). But not bad and I was using a sensitive Rode condenser. Haven't played much with them on my electric yet (customized Fender Stratocaster) but I'm sure they will be fine there as well. I like these picks a LOT and am ordering a dozen more to keep around. Good stuff."
1081,790,4.0,"This pick is great, highly recommended!  I love the sharp attack of the metal tip but the flexible body means the attack is not overly aggressive and metallickey sounding. I also I prefer the feel of a flexible pick. Grip is very good. This is my new favorite rock pick!"
976,790,3.0,high end pick.  felt comfortable even with its larger size.  took awhile to get used to but really liked it.
1083,790,4.0,"This pick will give you a distinct tone because it's made of metal, not plastic. I'm sure it won't wear out any time soon either. The size is regular.  I just wish it had a sharper point, but I can still pick fast enough with it to play speed metal."
1418,790,4.0,"I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks. I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today, and I just had to order two more, because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop, and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered, if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly, and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!! What a find!!UPDATE 6/6/14:Still the best pick I've ever played. If you're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings, don't worry, they won't (at least not from what I've seen). Also, pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks!"
226,705,4.0,This is a heavy duty strap. I use these on my fender guitars to make sure my guitar doesn't fall. It is a very comfy strap and prolly wouldn't break if you had a knife to it. It's the best strap money can buy.
1411,705,4.0,This is the kind of guitar strap you are going to have for the rest of your life extremely  thick and durable made of awesome material... buy it
443,705,4.0,I love dunlop straps because I'm a tall guy and they're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi.
1367,705,2.0,"This is just your typical nylon strap (a bit stiff, but durable).  I love the Celtic design enough to use this strap, but ordinarily I prefer higher quality materials than the nylon and plastic construction (with leather ends).  The leather is also a bit stiff, but not so stiff that it's not functional or reliable.  If Dunlop made this in cotton and steel, I'd pay 4x as much for it..."
296,705,4.0,"This is a really nice strap.  It's very thick and feels like it's well made and high quality for a non-bank breaking price on a strap.  Looks cool and vintage, I am a fan of many Dunlop products and this one does not disappoint at all."
706,705,4.0,"I bought two of these straps from a local store for thirty bucks each about two years ago. They've been the best straps; along with the same straps without the grommets, that I've used. I figured I'd save a bit and get a couple more from Amazon. I got them fast and saved twenty bucks. They do fine with my fairly heavy Fender and St Blues guitars as well as my P bass. They are middle of the road for price and width, but give me no comfort issues at all. My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. Super tight and easy to lower. Raising it is a different story though. I just save the fast &#34;lower played&#34; songs for last. Those are the best ones anyway. Excellent strap."
422,705,3.0,"this guitars strap can work in any guitar, from a really light  guitar as a bird of prey to a  heavy Warlock NT"
313,705,3.0,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first, it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
346,705,4.0,This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double-leather ends.  The color stands out well on the black background.  Available in various colors.
788,705,3.0,"nice sturdy construction for the most part, although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price, you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good, but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar, so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position, the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while, but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
944,705,4.0,as I said on my last Dunlop strap reviewI love the Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of them.when I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment.
297,681,3.0,"I was hoping this product would eliminate string ""talking"" and had mixed results.  It helped some but didn't get rid of the noise entirely.  It also makes the strings feel nice as well.  I will continue to use it."
15,681,4.0,"I can't remember how many years ago I started using this great stuff.  Like everything else, moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts, but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time I play!"
1210,681,4.0,"I've been using this product for many years. It has always worked well for me. I just spray a little on my hand and then rub the neck and strings, and I'm good to go!"
78,681,4.0,"I bought a new guitar & got it a day before my fingerease was delivered. My fingers were squeeking & sticking on the strings & back of neck, BAD!!After applying fingerease no more squeeks & much easier to move up & down the fretboard!!This stuff has been around for years.1st time I saw it was 40 years ago.Can't argue with that track record!!If you never used it get a can, you won't regret it!!Joe"
757,681,4.0,I've been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really don't play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy.
87,681,4.0,"If you haven't used this stuff, and if you plan to play 'squeak-less' guitar, take the risk. Buy some.  You'll wonder how you ever played without it.  You might even become the next Joe Satriani!"
889,681,3.0,"Apprehensive in buying let alone using but glad I did. Not an everyday product - but when your strings still have their tone but have lost a bit of their glassy feel . . . start to feel scratchy, this is a quick fix until you're ready to re-string."
1286,681,4.0,"I've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding. It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable. Clean, no residue from repeated use, and the glide across the strings is super nice. I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and wouldn't leave home without it."
228,681,3.0,"It claims to stop &#34;string talk,&#34; when you rub fingers on wound strings. It doesn't. But it does reduce it somewhat, and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long, or playing a new song over and over.I gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips. Seems to help my callouses without messing them up, and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing."
848,681,4.0,This stuff is great. The other guys are always coming over and grabin a shot or two cause I leave it in the pedal board. Iv'e been using this for years. I like smooth slippery strings for speed and ease. Humidity  not a problem with this stuff. .
1403,681,4.0,"I've been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars. It has multiple uses:-Cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands, extending the life and tone of your strings-Lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability, though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so-Works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints, etc. from the top, sides, and back, will not harm most finishes (as far as I know)I usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well.I did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference. I'm not sure if this is true as I've never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers. However, I typically try to keep it off of electronic  components in general just out of common sense.For under ten bucks, the can will last you awhile.  Just order a few at a time and find free shipping, you'll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time."
464,559,4.0,"I read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie-device. Working just fine so far, came quickly in the mail."
1,559,4.0,"I needed something so I would not have to drill a hole in my guitar to attach my strap...This is nicer than using a shoelace to attach the strap and it is an EASY, QUICK release and is very secure. I am happy with this product and will order some more in the future. Nice, inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem!"
115,559,4.0,"THis snap strap quick release system is a boon for those of us without a send strap button on our ukes sand guitars. Very serviceable, easy to use, sturdy."
556,559,3.0,I gave it 4 stars because it is well made and it does the job it is designed to do. But I personally do not like how it looks of it when installed. But that is only a personal opinion. You may see it differently. Don't use my opinion on how it looks to influence your purchase. It does what it was made to do. I purchased it to add an extension to a short guitar strap.
458,559,4.0,"It does the job it was intended to do. Before using this I just hooked the strap to the buttons and didn't like it. To confined, and with the quick release, it was more comfortable to use the strap. I'm glad I purchased this when I did."
534,559,4.0,I like that I can disconnect my strap quickly and easily. Makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly. I buy one of these for each guitar. But I only use my favorite strap.
470,559,4.0,This saves so much time for getting strap on and off.  Great design.  I love it.  Worth the money and is built well.
515,559,4.0,"I have two of these for my acoustics, and when I get another acoustic...I'll be buying another one of these. Nice quick release without having to tie anything. I have one that is over 5 years old and still works like a charm."
690,559,3.0,good if you dont want to have to drill your guitar for a stud mount. its nice and does its job. sometimes gets in the way of the strings or might stop a tone but it ultimately works
744,559,4.0,This is a nice addition to a guitar that you don't want to drill a hole into for a strap button.  It's a quick release with the buckle.  One end stays on the strap - the other around the head stock of the guitar.  Makes it nice if you have more than one guitar without a strap button- Buy 2.
78,559,4.0,My new guitar had only the back strap connector.You can put out over $20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks I decided on this.Attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head.You now have a quick release strap holder.Very well made & strong!!Happy I found this before spending way more than I needed to!!Highly recommend this product!!Joe
520,559,4.0,"Using on a Yamaha dreadnought acoustic.  Goes one easy, and feels sturdy.  Thinking about ordering another for an acoustic electric.Update 8-2-12:  ordered another for my Seagull acoustic electric.  Like the first one, works great."
433,559,4.0,Works with any strap. For a quick detach system of so you don't have to drill for a strap button to hold your guitar.
1316,559,4.0,"I just put it on my Baby Taylor guitar strap.  Nice!  Does the job and does it well.  Comes in a ""guitar shaped"" package that clearly shows how to install it in seconds if you are a newbie.  Glad I got this one.  It is exactly what I was hoping it would be."
1239,559,4.0,Came on time. Work great for my needs. Geart for set-ups and take-downs. Does lengthen the strap a bit but works.
1019,559,4.0,"I love this product.  I t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast, so y don't have to life it over your head.  Well worth the price."
1103,559,4.0,"The Acoustic Guitar Quick Release System is very interesting.  I ordered this as a filler item for a much larger order, just to give it a try.  So far so good.  Thanks."
490,559,4.0,"I bought this for an accousic guitar, then I had to have one for a mandolin, and now I also have one for a square-neck dobro.  Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don't leave much room for a leather strap.  Some case manufacturers have the same problem.  This item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it, that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job.  Same with the mandolin, if you want a wider strap. The dobro had the issue with the strap didn't have a great connector."
865,559,4.0,Slips right under the guitar strings and does not impede your guitar playing in any way. A very good design.
1271,559,3.0,"Love the quick release system, I just hook on one end to the guitar and the other to a strap, perfect for use when you are standing and playing.  I can just quick release it when I'm done.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
1080,559,4.0,"I was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar. I did see this device on amazon.com and I decide to buy and try one. I was pleasantly surprised with this ""Guitar Quick Release System"" is working good with my acoustic guitar. And because of that I did purchase 2 more for my other guitar and for my friend one."
1417,559,4.0,I have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me. This little device changed that by allowing me to use just about any standard strap and attaching it to the neck for better balance. And its inexpensive.
124,559,4.0,I'm a gadget lover and this is a good one.  It makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to/from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument.
780,559,4.0,"I've been using these on my acoustic guitars (and straps) for over a decade.  They're sturdy and convenient, and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap.  The ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage (or when you don't need the strap hanging from your guitar, e.g., sitting in a chair) works exactly as advertised.  I've purchased several of these and can't say enough good things about the product and company!"
202,559,3.0,"This is a handy little contraption.  I'm using on one of my cheaper guitars. It wasn't compatible with the other strap I've been using and I had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap, but it worked well with the strap on my other guitar.I think it's a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly."
838,559,4.0,"Quick release around the neck strap system. Unbeatable for acoustic, especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy. I would recommend this to anyone. &#8203;"
1053,559,4.0,"I play with straps whenever I feel like wearing a strap, and this thing is just ridiculously convenient. You can strap on and off within a span of 10 seconds. It holds up very well, also. I've had it for about a year now and have no complaints."
798,559,3.0,"Simple enough, right? Works as advertised. A great simple idea that I'm glad someone put into production. For my taste, the loop is too long where it wraps around at the headstock/nut area, so I just tied it up snug. I had been using the Martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto a plastic button, and this is far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off of the button on the Martin holder. However, folks with brand new shiny expensive guitars might want to take note: while the nylon lace that wraps around is nice and strong, it is fairly rough and abrasive, and my experience is that it will very definitely wear at the finish of your git in that area. Won't rub the finish off or anything to that degree, but if you're freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection on your guitar (which I am NOT), you will definitely notice the finish rubbed and dulled and even chipped a bit there at points of contact. I can think of a million simple solutions to that, but that's another story. Overall, great little item."
206,556,4.0,I bought it by mistake cause I don't own nor play the bass but it works for my guitar..fits well!! good quality too!
714,556,4.0,"This is a convenient way to keep your picks close in case you drop one or need to chance to different pick weight.  I don't have a bass, however, it fits great on my acoustical and electric guitar."
674,556,4.0,"If you're a bass player and use a pick, you need one of these. If you are a bass player and *sometimes* use a pick, you *really* need one of these! I bought one for every bass and a spare.Wedgies work better on bass than guitar, because the strings are thicker and usually parallel. I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer, and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings--but the bass ones stay put.Really, these things are great."
900,271,4.0,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more, I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way, if a longer unit is needed, I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware, very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front, using an SM 57, and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
932,271,0.0,I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)
315,271,4.0,is an excellent product super strong and works great arrived in excellent condition. This very cool.its strong and hard
1104,271,4.0,I use the gooseneck to position my pop filter over my microphone. It is also sturdy enough to use on my microphone holder to hold my microphone in place.
1055,271,4.0,"So stiff. Nothing short of a five pound weight will cause this extension to buckle. If you sing and use effects pedals for an instrument, and can't rely on a good boom microphone stand being at every venue, get one of these and throw it in with your gear."
1016,271,3.0,I am glad I bought this. It is exactly what was described and it was a good price. Get it.
909,271,4.0,"I got this to install it on a podium. It is perfect. The construction is very sturdy, and it always stays in place. Get it, if you need one."
516,271,4.0,"I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck, Blackare too long for what I want to do. Sometimes - on rare occasions - I have used this to extend the length of the 13"" model.The mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone, which is small, relatively light, and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals. When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax, I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand, and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic stand.Because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around, plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars. In some situations they can be a savior during set up.  I will empahsize, though, that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 (which is slightly larger and heavier), and this may not hold your mic in place."
379,271,0.0,"This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.Instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths..."
227,397,3.0,"There are a ton of phaser options out there - even from MXR themselves - which makes this issue a bit confusing.  I'd owned a Phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one.  A few years ago I didn't have the budget to consider the more expensive MXR versions, so I just got this one.I think it sounds fine.  I gigged with it for years without issue.  Yes, there's a slight volume bump, but I think this is really mostly a midrange hump that will alter your tone and give you some distortion, depending on how your amp is set up.  I always use it with a clean tone, and I'm used to it so it's not a big deal.If I were to shop for a phaser today I'd consider some of the other MXR models, as well as versions from other manufacturers which offer a mix knob.  A phaser is a very specific sound, but I love it in small doses.  For my needs this one works."
426,397,4.0,This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. Phasing is very sensitive and delivers as it should. No need for the EVH red logo version (unless you're a super fan or something) - I actually believe this unit will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
400,397,2.0,I returned this because I wanted the script version instead. Very different sound. Watch YouTube to compare models. This pedal seems older as well.
803,397,2.0,"This is a great pedal for price. No it's not the most amazing phase pedal, but it's still quality. I know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board. If you don't use a lot of phaser but need it for a song or 2. Buy it."
387,397,4.0,"Simple and compact.No clicking or buzzing.Perfect for old Van Halen solos like in &#34;You Really Got Me.&#34;Plus, you can get a swooshing bright sound you can't get with a Flange and Chorus when backing it down and playing clean.Play some old KISS or some Rob Zombie.$65 bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser isn't available in most amp emulators.&#34;You know your man is working hard... he's worth a deuce!&#34;"
504,397,0.0,"I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-""script"" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up ""MXR Phase 90 Mods,"" and ""Erik's Corner"" will show you how.) I made the ""R28,"" ""C11,"" and ""C12"" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90."
1070,397,4.0,"The MXR Phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by Eddie Van Halen. At present, I own an MXR Phase 90, a Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter, and a Line 6 MM4 Modulations Modeler (with a few phaser patches), so I can compare these three units.The Phase 90 has a single ""Speed"" control that sets the rate of the phase, so it is simple to use. If there is a single knob, that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit. In this case, I agree.The MXR Phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units. In my opinion, it also gives the best sound within its capabilities, and actually seems to boost the volume slightly. The Boss PH-3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable, and the Line 6 MM4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because I usually don't leave modulations on for an entire song, but turn them on/off in different sections (unless its a chorus).Of the three, the Phase 90 has the least versatility. You can imitate the Phase 90 sound on both of the other units (the Line 6 MM4 does a slightly better job) and both the PH-3 and MM4 have more sonic possibilities. Also, the Boss PH-3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the Phase 90 which stays in a ""normal"" range. But again, of the three the MXR Phase 90 sounds the best of the three at what it can do.Bottom Line:(1) A classic pedal at a great price(2) Great sound & slight volume boost(3) Simple to use(4) Limited sonic possibility, ""safe"" or ""normal"" guitar sounds (no crazy extremes)(5) Beautiful bright orange color, you can't miss it(6) Compact size does not eat up pedalboard space"
961,859,4.0,Bought this for a mic that my daughter received and fit well. Product is as described and fits mic perfect. Will buy more in future.
665,859,4.0,not much to say about foam.  They do the job well.  You can't go wrong.  I would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap.
166,859,4.0,nice cover for my behringer xm8500. it is fitted snugly and well made. the color is nice and bright. i wanted to have other colors but this is only available in red and black also.
191,859,4.0,Hm. I received this. I opened this. I've used it. I also use it. This product seems to be a pretty good product.
216,859,4.0,"I do not have much to say about this. It does what it was designed to do and it looks fine.I found myself actually trying to see if it will rip, for the purposes of this review. Just so I could make some sort of comment about it... You can rip it if you try, but it's not likely to happen during everyday use.It's fairly thick. If that isn't what you want then I would look elsewhere. This should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn't have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen."
997,859,4.0,These fit snug on my Shure SM58 Beta A mics. Nice texture and it doesn't affect the sound of my mics.I recommend em!
988,859,4.0,"It works well, hasn't broken down (despite much abuse), and can easily be cleaned. Now if only all windscreen's were this sturdy, I'd be a happy customer."
644,859,4.0,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick, but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it, however, I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live, I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though, I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant, white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
371,859,4.0,"Came in time, worth the price and fits perfect on to my mic. As an advice to every one using a mic whether it is a regular or condenser mic, always use this protection on the mic to avoid the body fluids getting inside grill and on to diaphragm. This is worth the investment for your expensive mic."
381,859,4.0,Fits the Behringer XM8500 perfectly. It actually dampens the sound giving better a more smoother sound and reducing harsh parts of vocals.
159,859,4.0,I have been using these simple windscreens for years and they always perform great .. escpecially for the money .. I would recommend this to anyone.
873,859,3.0,"Blocks noise perfectly, priced better than the local store. fit very well my mic. Awesome! Great for an amateur, just like me"
1164,859,4.0,Works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations. When the Z108 Party patrol is out and about the never leave without it.
1391,859,4.0,"This is a black sponge for smaller mics.  I got mine for use with some Behringer mics.  At first, I didn't think they would fit, but it just took a bit of stretching.  They fit really snug, which is excellent because they won't fall off or slide around on the mic causing noise.  They do what they're supposed to do."
142,859,0.0,"Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea.Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.Why?Because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.No kidding!  I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech.  So save your dough, buy any color but RED.Diva's!!!!  What can I say?"
1249,859,4.0,"This does a great job blocking out the wind on a microphone and other unwanted noise. I can literally blow into the microphone and you won't get any &#34;pop&#34; in the microphone, only sound waves."
1068,859,4.0,the foam ball prevents wind pop and it also doesn't get smelly like some other foam would be. i would highly recommend it.
677,859,3.0,"What can you say about a Foam Ball type mic windscreen?  Well it fits the RODE M1 Mic I was using nice and tight. Quality is good, didn't tear apart when you put it on the mic and the recorded sound is just fine."
951,859,4.0,Alot of Zoom H1 users put this over their mics.  The fit is nearly perfect.  For that application this is THE windscreen to get.  Works great.
946,859,2.0,I definately helps cut down &#34;wind whistle&#34; on my mic. can't say anything great about the product but I cant say anything bad. It does what it is suppose to
1420,859,3.0,"Works just as it should, love it and a great price to boot"
416,859,4.0,If you have several different people on the same mic you should buy a stock of these. They are well made and do work. I would buy them again.
141,859,4.0,I used these on a Behringer XM8500'sIt fits tight and does not obstruct the tone greatly.I have not tested its wind screen capabilities.I use it to protect my microphones from singer&#8217;s saliva :-)Works great and does not fall off.
1250,859,3.0,"Bought this cover to go with Behringer mic.  It does what it's designed to do.  It was a little hard getting it onto the head of the mic, but at least that way I know it's not going to be falling off during a performance or a recording session.  Economical way to keep spit out of mic"
1399,859,4.0,"I use this for my rockband microphones but be careful , if you have cats the hair will get stuck in it. Other than that it really works well in taking away some of the echo from loud speakers while playing rockband."
961,444,4.0,Bought this with a mic and foam cover and stand and it all works perfect. Geat value for the money. My daughters use all of them every week. Will buy more in the future
372,444,4.0,"A classic mic clip -- simple, inexpensive and durable enough. Keep several spares in your kit; even the expensive ones break."
1249,444,3.0,"This is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand. It holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce. However, The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger, as well as the tail-end of the grip; because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone, you won't be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first."
91,444,4.0,"This is a simple, straight forward and worthy replacement mic clip for the standard Shure SM57/58 type mic. Well made, reasonably priced as with most On Stage stuff."
516,444,4.0,"These are obviously designed for microphones with the Shure SM-57/58 series form factor. I use mine for the much heavierBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone, and this clip holds it right where I adjust it to.The threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision-machined. Mine effortlessly mate with anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Black, anOn Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone Standand aMusician's Gear Die-Cast Mic Stand Black, which are the only stands with which I've used this clip.Bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the Shure SM (and PG and similar), or a different brand that uses that form factor, then this clip will probably not work. Also I cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring, although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up, and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares (actually, you SHOULD do that.)I am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model. I have five or six on hand, including a few spares, and if I needed more clips, this is the one I would purchase."
814,444,4.0,What can I say it works...I think I could write a book here...not!...just a solid little mic holder. Glad I bought it.
645,444,3.0,"These kind of clips can break. But if you're just a little bit careful not to push the microphone in too hard, it should last for a long long time."
1168,444,1.0,I bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a GLS mic and it doesn't fit either.  A little too small.
968,444,3.0,"I bought these to fit my two microphones - they snuggly hold Shure SM57 and SM58.  However, my two mics came with Shure clips (to my surprise).  These clips are 1/16 in. from front to back.  In comparison, the Shure clips are 1/4 in. to 1/8 in. from front to back.  So, the Shure clips are more sturdily built, but both seem to hold the mics well."
1048,444,2.0,Very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic .It hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out. Great for back up singers .

23,444,4.0,"Worked perfectly to use my Samson mic with a stand I purchased. Definitely would purchase again, solid quality build. Good purchase!"
256,814,4.0,good deal. quite the steal. if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal. im sure it will be amazing. and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal. those are pretty crucial to a drumset. :)
601,814,3.0,"the Pinstripe heads are AMAZING.  I will buying them for life, they are very durable and sound great.  the emperor X snare head on the other hand is junk.  It makes my snare sound like a high tom almost, hate it."
545,814,4.0,"I bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs, the same heads I bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven't torn. these heads are amazing and a very good investment. make your kit sound very professional and I just love em to death. definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads"
882,543,3.0,"Good short cable, plugs easy"
436,543,4.0,"These are by far the best value for effects pedal cables.  I find the local music stores won't stock them, forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about $7.00 each.  These cables, so far, have done the job at a fraction of the price.  We will see how well they stand up over the long-term as they are a cheaper cable.  But for the price, they are great.  At 6 per pack, you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead -- if that even happens."
226,543,4.0,These cables are awesome. They do what they are suppose to do and do it well. I personally like that they are smaller in the middle and are easier to fold than regular cable. If you are looking to connect your pedals and dont want to break your wallet look no farther than HOSA 6inch cable!
574,543,3.0,This was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on.  It's easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops.  I recommend it to all aspiring musicians.
274,543,4.0,"These pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price. Well-designed and reliable, I highly recommend these. Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product."
28,543,2.0,I wish I bought longer cables but these cables are fine. They do what they are supposed to do but I know I can spend a few more dollar dollar bills and get a higher quality cable but the tonal difference wouldn't be anything significant.
269,543,4.0,Works as described.  Solid little wires that allow you to be creative in how you hook up your guitar pedals...may work other applications that require the same type of plug.
650,543,4.0,"These are great for connecting effects pedals.  I really don't know how else you would do it in a small space, without making your pedal box look like a plate of spaghetti."
302,543,2.0,I got these because I work as a live sound engineer and they sometimes come in handy used as interconnects between guitar pedals.
192,543,4.0,"These cables work well in my jam space, they do seem a little thin if they were to be used heavily in gig'ing but at 1/3 the price, that's fair. Don't get me wrong, these are good cables and for the price I am very happy; I'd buy more for sure. I would probalby uses these for gigging as well if I didn't have heavier duty jumpers available.As the title says, these are a great value and work well."
1288,543,4.0,good product great price. as long as you take care of them they seem as though they will last quite a while.
1245,543,4.0,"This was perfect I am very happy with the  Hosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable, 6 Pack!"
235,543,3.0,great price. i would recommend it to anyone needing patch cables for their peddle board. very flexable and pretty good quality
1145,543,3.0,"These are a bit short, only complaint.But I should have known that going into a 6"" double right ended cable.Perhaps a straight to straight would be better.Anyway, besides that, they seem to be decent enough quality.I can see a few years of careful use."
583,166,0.0,"yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable."
550,166,4.0,"I'll keep it short: I owned a Boss EQ pedal in the past and didn't have much luck with it. I tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound I was looking for but the Boss just wouldn't do it for me. Fast forward a few years and I purchase this little baby on a whim.  Man, am I glad I did!  The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for.  A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom-end than it could ever manage on its own, and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced, well-rounded sound.  Love it and wouldn't wanna part with it!The pedal itself is built like a rock.  I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing.  The individual sliders, although not quite as Ford-tough as the rest of the pedal (haha), feel nice and slide easy.  Each slider lights up red when engaged, which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stage.If you're on the fence about an EQ or which EQ brand to buy, I recommend you give this little monster a stomp."
1169,166,2.0,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig, it doesn't add much except for hiss, unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit, though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment, Line 6 equipment, Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar, amp, wah, and guitar, or amp, wah, guitar, and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out, though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player, but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
704,166,4.0,"I have been disappointed with the last EQ pedal I owned witch was a Boss GE7, it was very honkey and colored my tone to much, this pedal is much more musical the layout of the essential frequency's is great, plus they are lighted and very ez to see. and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last for ever"
686,166,3.0,"I have had several MXR pedals through the years ... I have always found their quality to be very good for the price ... in fact, some of their pedals exceed the competitors' products for less than half the price ... (to each his own and certainly there are higher levels of quality out there but just because it is priced more doesn't mean it is that much better)If you need a little tone sweetener, this pedal can deliver ... with flatter EQ's it is fairly noiseless ... but as with all EQ's, if you boost certain frequencies pretty high, you will get some noise ...Simple to use and I particularly like the lighted LEDs for each band ... this feature makes this unit a good choice for the stage ...As with all MXR pedals, it is built solid and road-rugged ...For the price, this is a nice pedal, simple to use and built to last"
523,450,4.0,"Highest quality guitar I've ever seen in this price range. It looks, feels, and sounds amazing!! A+ I bought two"
458,450,4.0,"I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price. They were good quality and if this didn't work out then I would have probably gone that route. To my surprise, this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar. The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar. The local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down. I replaced the strings right away. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it. Definitely worth the price you pay."
34,450,4.0,"This was my first acoustic guitar, and I've received some surprised looks about its tone and play-ability -- both from from my luthier (who used to be a tech at Martin) to a couple pro players with 30-40+ years respectively under their belts. It's light, comfortable, well made, has a fast neck, and is just marvelous in every way for a beginner like myself. Wonderfully priced. I was expecting to be disappointed, but didn't want to invest in a new hobby until I was sure I'd stick with it.It's possible that I just lucked out with a good one. After a year of playing my Jasmine, I have no urge to upgrade to anything else. Will confess that I'd like a 12-string, but that's another animal.I am too new and inexperienced with acoustics to be able to really define the sonic quality of this guitar compared to more expensive models (I'm more of an electric guy), but for me in my ignorant state, it's 5 stars without hesitation.I did need to have it set up, however, and the stock strings on mine were in poor condition. Don't recall if I purchased it on Amazon. In any event, a $30-$50 trip to the luthier with new strings, and it felt like a guitar far in excess of $100. It has stayed in tune quite nicely, and I often change tunings (standard, mostly Eb, occasional full step down, Open D, G and others).No fret buzz, and I just love the feel of the neck. I do wish the body was a tad thinner as I have shoulder problems, but I'm sure a thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass and richness. Nice and light, however, and perfect for carrying on your back.By the way, I have the model with the black pickguard -- the one pictured looks similar in every other way. Quite sure it's the same model."
1236,450,2.0,"It is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online!I took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared.Here's my take-PROS:- Cheap! $90 is very inexpensive for a guitar!- Well packaged for shipping- Arrived 1 day early- Fair quality. This is not a top of the line or even middle of the line guitar. It is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship, but not stellar.- Good sound! This does have a very good sound- with new strings of course- Size: This is not a full size guitar, but larger than a 3/4. It is a ""concert"" size which I like!- It is a cut-away design without electronics! This combo is very rare!- Fair to good wood materials and furniture- Good design! This guitar sounds good, feels good, looks very good.- Matte finish: this comes with a matte finish, not shiny- I like thatCONS:- Strings- corroded poor quality strings- neck condition: Neck has slight bend, I needed to adjust the truss and file a few frets. There is still a slight dip and bump at the 12th fret causing fret buzz.- frets are not smoothed on ends- neck surface is not sanded well but smooth enoughI like this guitar. It's very inexpensive, needs a little work, sounds very good. I hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase."
1299,450,4.0,"I've played the guitar for a number of years, some of them professionally, and during that time I've owned guitars by Fender, Gibson, Ovation, B.C. Rich, Yamaha and Applause. That said, admittedly, this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap, expendable guitar that was reasonably playable, that I could take with me when I go camping. While my expectations weren't all that high due to guitar's price, upon reading other reviews and having experienced Takamine's quality, I decided to gave this Jasmine a try.  I'm glad I did - what a nice guitar it turned out to be! Out of the box, the fit and matte finish were impressive. The neck action was nicely set up, the intonation is spot-on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone.  The tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely.  Note that I changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra-light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos. The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price."
874,450,4.0,"This guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well. I am now a fan of Takamine. Their is nothing bad I can say about this guitar and I would take this guitar anywhere. This is my 4th guitar I have bought and is by far my favorite guitar. I have 2 electric guitars and now 2 acoustic, this being the second acoustic. I wanted a cheap guitar I could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up, except I got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up. People are complaining about the guitar not having a glossy finish. It wasn't supposed to be glossy to give it a richer look. If this guitar was glossy it wouldn't be as nice sounds stupid but it is true. You have to see the guitar face to face to understand what I mean. This guitar I would recommend to anyone. I am trying to get my friends to buy one so can all have a acoustic guitar, lol. Thank You!!!!!!"
372,450,3.0,"I have played the guitar for nearly 50 years now, and wanted an inexpensive small-body steel-string guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling. This one fills the bill pretty well. Build quality is quite good (made in Indonesia, not China as I had expected), and the intonation is perfect. The finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well. A pick guard is present, but when I removed the plastic shipping protector, the entire guard came up with it. The adhesive residue comes right off, so I will play the guitar without a pickguard. Bracing is light -- the entire guitar is light. The body is a bit larger in the lower bout than I expected, but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnought.I take issue with some reviewers' suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box. The string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck, cramping the fingers. The nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more. The action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully, and just a little at a time. This work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier, but if you can do it yourself, will improve the playability of the instrument.The strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap, so I replaced them with a set of D'Addario EJ-16 Light Phosphor-Bronze. The improvement in tone was immediate -- this little guitar sounds pretty darn good. All in all, with some careful modification, this is a good guitar for the beginner or casual player, and a very acceptable one for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification him/herself."
480,450,4.0,"I don't own one, but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting. Didn't know much about the guitar, but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. Changed the strings, and, other than the action being a little high, it's as good as anything I've played for under $500. I honestly thought it cost around $350, so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100. It's definitely a great value.In part because of my experience with this guitar, I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year, (for considerably more money), and it's simply incredible."
1149,450,3.0,"Bought a Takamine 40 years ago. It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid $125. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $800 when I bought this Jasmine.I got a superb machine for the money. Simply superb.  It's not my old Takamine, but the negative differences are slight, and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitar.The first is that the finish is not as good. The sanding between coats was skimped, which means that the finish on the front has some texture; the sides of the guitar are also a bit rough.The second probably flows from the first.  The tone is a touch wooden; it doesn't sing as the old Taka did.Positives: the intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and enjoyable to play) with a slide. After the first tune-up of the strings, it stayed in tune.For its price, this guitar is a superb introduction to playing.A very young child, or a small woman, will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort. For everyone else, it should fit pretty comfortably.The intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and enjoyable to play) with a slide. After the first tune-up of the strings, it stayed in tune.Any beginner, and more than a few cost-sensitive intermediate players, will be pleased with this guitar."
109,450,4.0,"I bought this as a deployment that was shipped to afghanistan from amazon. I wasn't planning on using this as anything but a practice guitar. The way the military palletizes all of its cargo, I figured there was about a fifty percent chance it would arrive in a flattened box with wooden splinters sticking out of it, but I took the chance anyway. It arrived intact, and ready to play. The strings are a bit cheap, but the guitar itself is well made, and has a really nice rich tone. I was planning on giving it away when I left, but I am shipping it home instead, and it wioll cost me almost the price of the guitar to mail it home, but it is worth it. This one has worked out so well I am taking a chance on a 12 string, soon to arrive in Theater."
1255,450,4.0,"It's kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of (mostly) positive reviews already. But I can't help it - I like this guitar. Quite simply, this is a really nice guitar. Is it $750 nice? No. But for less than $100, nice doesn't even describe it.My Jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing.  The outside box had a little damage, but the guitar was well protected inside, so no problem.Since I'd read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish, one of the first things I did was check it out thoroughly. Nope, no flaws noticeable to me.  Kind of a satin ""laid back"" finish that feels good and looks nice.  Oh, but I did immediately remove the pick guard.  It just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and (in my opinion) it looks better without it.Other reviews had complained about a too-low action. But mine seems dead on.  Of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule. But even so, there's really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low.Some mentioned rusty strings.  Not on mine. The strings looked fine, and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well.And of course the guitar sounds good.  Again, maybe not $750 good, but at least $250-300 good. And certainly better than I expected it to sound at that price.So, if you want a nice sounding, decent looking, inexpensive guitar - you've found it.  Stop wasting time. Just click the buy it button."
16,450,4.0,"I bought my son a thousand dollar Epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago, so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for Christmas, I told him an expensive one was not in our budget.We went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one. The sound was absolutely fabulous, much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one.The store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well. In my opinion, this was as good as other brands costing three times as much. I'm not sure how Takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money, but if you're looking for a starter guitar, or just looking to add another guitar to your collection, this would make an excellent choice.I inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar, but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price.We also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs. theJasmine by Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar, Natural."
1064,450,3.0,"Has a good sound. Stays in tune.  Wish it came in a darker grain of wood.  A little bulky,  My arm goes to sleep sometimes after extended playing,  wish it was a little thiner.  I bought it because I wanted a cutaway and this was a decent price."
123,450,4.0,"A value and a half. If you need a beater this is it. It plays great,  great fret job and solid tone. Have recommended to several students. This guitar pays better than some 3 times is value!"
519,450,3.0,"I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar, there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar, I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it, and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected, and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party."
1084,450,4.0,"I was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after I tuned it and began to play.My guitar is absolutely beautiful. The finish is flawless. And it's got that new guitar smell...ahhhhhh.It does have a pick guard (that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog) which pleases me. It would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick. I read one review on a music vendor's website where the reviewer complained about Takamine and Jasmine printed all over the pick guard. And they were right about that...but I found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker. Dah.The strings are a little heavier than I like but I'll be changing them in a few weeks anyway.The sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything you'd expect to pay more for. It has a rich, full bodied sound.I am now a diehard Takamine fan."
816,450,2.0,As title says:1) High Action2) Inadequate Loudness for pickingI compared this to the Mitchell MD100 and think the Mitchell is very good for it's price.You can compare both at guitar center.
483,450,4.0,"well.. First of all, I am a beginner.. I do not know anything about guitar... I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets... Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue, so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me.. It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all.. The string does not corroded, but I changed mine anyway. The fret does not have any issue at all.. and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect.. The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect. When my professor starts playing it, he was surprised by the sound it produced. He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!... He also bought one this morning...haha...anyways, I buy it from amazon and the packaging is great!!...My guitar comes in a perfect condition, and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody!!..."
177,450,4.0,"Right out of the box this guitar was flawless. I played it with the strings it came with (to inspect intonation-fret buzz etc. the old strings would work for set-up if needed) and the intonation (harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret) was dead on. Absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret. I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time. To say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just doesn't do it justice. I have played many expensive acoustic guitars that didn't sound or play as well as this even after set-up. The lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding ""tinny"" or banjo like. A very well built, great sounding guitar. For the price you can't go wrong. I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros. I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price. 100% satisfied. Rock on Jasmine!!"

It works well without scratching the delicate surfaces.It is extremely well made and I have thrown it in the washer/dryer and it comes out clean and new looking. I keep it in my guitar case and use it often!
409,802,2.0,I chose this rating because a fine paper towel seems to work just as well as this microfiber polish cloth.
168,802,4.0,"Great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars.  Soft touch, easy care - can't beat it!"
590,802,4.0,"Lets be honest, it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth. It either cleans or it doesn't. This cleans/polishes all of my guitars great. Just make sure the strings are off so that this doesn't get caught on them. This is a brand I've come to trust."
1005,802,0.0,"Do NOT use these to polish your guitar. It leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. A total disaster. These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything."
1054,802,4.0,"I have a rose-gold plated flute, and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating.  This does the job perfectly.  Wipes off fingerprints & smudges easily, and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate.  Is easy on the plating and very gentle.  Washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries.  Am very pleased."
137,802,4.0,"Scratch free, durable, machine washable. I use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much, much longer. You place the cloth next to a string, then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces, sides and top of the string, then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times, then repeat on the remaining strings. I then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard, then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys. Takes a matter of moments and works great. Then once every week or two, it just goes in with the laundry, comes out perfectly clean again.Polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric. It is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface, but it works well for polishing. If I'm using carnuba wax, I use a 100% cotton towel to remove it, but for dry polishing wouldn't be without one for each guitar."
1334,802,4.0,It helps to clean the guitar. I have an eletric acoustic guitar and it was a good choice to buy this!
92,802,3.0,"This is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars. I tried this untreated 'MicrofiberPolish Cloth' on my Gibson ES-339 because I had heard good things about it.We'll begin with some stats: the cloth is 11-3/4"" by 11-3/4"" and has an 1/8"" border stitched aroundthe edge. It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea. There is a small warning on theback of the package that states: ""Not designed for cleaning electrical devices."" You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry. Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny. I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body's front and back and BACKof the neck. I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off. When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish.What I discovered about this cloth, even with increased elbow grease, is that it has it's limitations.So, if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out. If the body oils have been there for awhile, probably collecting dust, then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument. Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument. Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument. You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it.I decided to use Dunlop's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges. I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely. Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'. It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid. I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind.You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish.The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play. I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated  on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar.So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything. I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean  and polished with minimal effort. My highexpectations, based upon the blurb, were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around. It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess.Nonetheless, I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime. I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing."
12,802,2.0,"Compared to Ernie Ball's cloth, it's good enough for wiping down things.  It is soft and non abrasive; EB's cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs. Overall good cloth for general use."

520,802,4.0,"I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars.  Therefore, after playing, I always wipe down my strings to extend their life.  I've used other microfiber cloths, but they tend to break easy and leave ""fuzzies"" on the strings, which I then have to remove one by one.  This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use.  It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use.  I liked my first one so much, that I am putting in another order."
452,802,4.0,At first glance this can look like a microfiber cloth.  But these one's really get the guitars shining up really nice.  They are made for glasses and stuff like that and they really polish good.

These cloths are gentle and prevent scratching the finish unlike some of the microfiber types I see here and in stores that tend to leave streaks and in some cases scratches on the guitar."
755,802,4.0,"Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me. This cloth cleans up pretty well, but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook. I dunno if they weren't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth. They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better. Like a previous reviewer, i'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer.Update: Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before, i like this and my ernie ball cloth :)From 3 to 5 starts!!"
951,802,3.0,This works very good on a silver flute.  It's soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it.  Would purchase again.
634,802,4.0,This is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should. There's nothing else to say but to get it if you need it. The quality doesn't suck so don't worry about. Peace out.
1061,802,4.0,I bought this for my son to keep his guitar clean with. He really likes it a lot. It keeps fingerprints wiped off nicely.
1063,802,4.0,"Polishes well. You could probably buy a microfiber cloth from somewhere else and it would do the same thing, but this one works well."
811,802,4.0,I feel like this picks dirt off my guitar strings better than the Taylor cloth I also have in the case
202,802,3.0,"The price is fair and it serves its purpose.  I'm pretty happy with this cloth.  I just wish it was bigger so I could have a greater surface area of the cloth to use before washing it.  I haven't had to wash it yet, but it looks like it would hold up."
1382,802,4.0,Well it's a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar.  This is a fairly good size cloth at that.
558,802,4.0,"I bought my first one from Amazon over a month ago - and simply fell in love with it.  It cleans/polishes wood, metal (although for strings, I use GHS' Fast Fret), eye-glasses, computer screens, etc with wonderful ability, easily replacing ""casual"" cleaning/polishing fluids.  I even recently bought a 2nd just because.  And yes, the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use- I knew it was time when it wasn't wiping off the smudges as quickly.  It came out with a slightly nappy texture (to be expected really), but still works as well as ever.  There is a vast amount of different ""polish"" cloth brands out there, but you won't go wrong with this one."
1121,802,4.0,"I really did not expect much from this rag. I just wanted a good quality lint-free / scratch-free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use. I was totally surprised that it actually works this good. Removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner. This will probably help protect your finish over the long run too.You may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag. This thing rocks! It picks up every smudge, smear, & print and leaves nothing behind. It's an amazing little cleaning tool, and I WILL replace it if/when it ever wears out. If you are like me, and you want your instruments to look clean & grunge-free onstage, you should check out this little wonder. You can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want. Doesn't get any easier. Great product!**********************A note about the mixed reviews. I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page. It really isn't fair to the actual good product to have it's rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM. It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want. When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD micro-fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint, it makes me sad. I have had both of the other items, and this micro-fiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2. This item has sewn/seamed edges that will not fray. It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints & smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind. No scratches, no lint, no hint it was ever there. My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth, and I use the thing almost every day.I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it. I told him I would just get another. Then I came here and couldn't remember which version I bought, and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item (leaves behind lint?? What the crap are they talking about?)...turns out they are talking about a completely different item. I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Micro-fiber, then I placed an order for 2 more (1 for me, 1 to give away, again).Putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course. Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page (literally) and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed. At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones, you know what version to buy and which to avoid.Anyway, /End rant."
363,802,2.0,Works as advertised for polishing my guitars. I don't use any other cleaners such as Fender Polish when I use this cloth.
710,802,4.0,We've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I've tried before. With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.Reasonably priced too.
1247,177,4.0,This pedal is super...tons of verb if you want it.... makes any amps built in verb obsolete after you plug into this.. I highly recommend digi stuff... I have this coupled with other pedals and a Jamman stereo and it is awesome...thanks.... love shopping through Amamzon
274,177,4.0,"Purchased this to replace a Behringer pedal because the Behringer introduced a ""swishing"" sound. This pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless. Good product and got good price here on Amazon."
804,177,4.0,"I use this pedal mainly for the &#34;church&#34; setting in ambient volume swells. It has seven different reverbs you can choose from (including reverse). So it will definitely suit your needs for whatever you require reverb for. It is ruggedly built and digital, which some will like and others won't. I like it. That said, I have taken a liking to other digitech pedals as well. They sound good and are affordable."
331,177,4.0,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep, rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid, and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly, I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much, but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon, U2, etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones, this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals, but this one definitely suits all my needs."
549,177,3.0,"This pedal is OK, it has all you need in a reverb, the controls are simple and the sound is good, there are other much more expensive units, but this pedal can be compared to those expensive units, the sound is digital clear and the features are basic, it is worth to have one to have fun with, I recommend this product, DigiTech quality is top of the line so you dont have to worry about it, in general a very good unit."
894,177,1.0,This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY! You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.I'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.Over all I would not recommend this product.
1397,177,4.0,"I've had this pedal for a number of years. It provides a wide range of reverb effects, sounds natural and has a killer stereo output. I've haven't heard a pedal that competes with spring reverb, but this pedal keeps up with any simulated reverb pedal I've heard and does an excellent job with amps that lack a spring unit. The effects can go way beyond what a spring unit can do as well. Recommended."
804,603,2.0,"The digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal. Do I use it? yes. However, I would likely trade it for an MXR or DUNLOP if I had the opportunity. It doesn't sound bad per se' but does have some hiss to it. It also boosts your signal (a noticeable volume increase). While some may like this, I want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain."
1148,603,2.0,"As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals,but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days, but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review."
686,603,1.0,"Compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but I cannot abide the noise ... I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ..."
1201,603,4.0,"I have stayed clear of using pedals for most of my playing carrier (over 40 years), but after installing a Fernandes FSK-101 Sustainer kit and getting the same results as most other guys: Too much sustain on adjacent strings which makes the whole experience a joke, I decided to go ahead and try this compressor out and am very happy with the results. I play mostly clean (jazz, blues, rock) and this unit gives me at least twice the sustain as I would normally get without any pedals."
549,603,4.0,"Good and transparent compressor with low noise operation, very tough construction, although not the best it sounds good to me, it depends on the situation, the sustain is good."
550,15,4.0,"In my opinion, this is the best guitar volume pedal available. It is affordable and does exactly what it's supposed to, and does it very, very well I might add. I've tried numerous volume pedals, from Morley to Line 6 to the Dunlop DVP1, and none are as fluid or feel as good as the Ernie Ball Jr.I owned the Dunlop DVP1 for several months, and while it did an okay job of cutting the volume I simply did not like the feel nor the low volume levels. It felt way too bulky under foot and went from about 0 to about 3 when barely applying volume. This is unacceptable when you're trying to clean up your distortion channel or trying to accomplish a slow volume swell. But as soon as I laid the Ernie Ball down and plugged it in I fell in love. Not only does it feel great under your foot and provide precise control, it has a complete volume sweep. Add in some delay and it will give you an organ-type swell. Absolutely perfect!I've heard some people complain about the Ernie Ball Jr being a flimsy pedal but I just don't see this. Of course, it's not a tank like the Dunlop or Morley, but it still feels very solid. It's also lighter than the others mentioned, which is a plus for traveling musicians.I would HIGHLY recommend this pedal. It is one of my favorites on my board and I couldn't imagine playing without it!"
533,15,4.0,"Works smoothly, built like a tank and looks good as well. I've tried other passive volume pedals that didn't work...this one works. Worth every penny."
577,15,4.0,"If you want to do swells with your instrument, or make notes &#34;cry&#34;, this' will do the trick. Smooth, reliable action and no noise too."
879,15,4.0,"I needed a volume pedal of a smaller stature for my pedal case and this one fits the bill...AND...it's heavy duty, accurate and has a real smooth fall off."
1175,15,1.0,"If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a POORLY engineered pedal.  It can't be ""true bypass"" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years.If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT ""true bypass"" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple ""first do no harm"" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their ""string"" mechanism over time.  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver."
116,15,4.0,There is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these.  I have several.  Came in perfect working condition.  Great Buy.
1146,15,4.0,"I recommend this pedal to anyone considering a volume pedal.  It is super sturdy, transparent and I fully expect to have this for a very long time.  The tuner out is a nice feature, but the serious selling point is the quality.  Go no further for your volume pedal needs."
1036,630,4.0,"I have a HEAVY Epiphone EB-0 bass and this strap is a life-saver.  Nice, thick and padded and doesnt look too dorky.  The little pocket for the pick is not too practical though because the pick easily falls out and is lost."
1381,630,4.0,"Having a neck-heavy Epiphone SG G-400, I really like this strap because it is not only comfortable but also provides enough friction to keep the guitar in place without much effort. Leather straps are good, too, but they tend to slide off the strap button."
15,630,4.0,I bought this for one of my heavier 5-strings as a replacement strap and love it.  I use that particular bass for slap and usually hang that bass higher on me that the others for good slap technique.  This strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable.Good Strap!
372,630,3.0,"The strap is adjustable on both ends, and the front adjustment slider sat right on my shoulder. I cut it off and glued the material back together with Shoe-Goo, and now it's great. Padding and wide material make standing with a heavy bass a whole lot less tiring."
267,630,4.0,"I have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars. I absolutely love them! Great quality, very strong, and great variation of length on them. They are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders. I highly recommend this strap!"
440,630,4.0,"Bought one, tried it on a P-bass, loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price, very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these, this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap, other than that, this is a killer product for a killer price."
403,630,4.0,"I bought this strap to use with an acoustic bass that is rather gargantuan,- A Tacoma 4 string, after a bit of adjustment it worked great. Then I bought an ovation 12 string roundback (very roundback this is a deep dish) I needed a strap to make this bad boy sit where I was, so I grabbed this strap off the bass and gave it a shot. After adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great. Now I'm buying another strap so I will have one on either guitar.(I usually keep a strap on all my guitars if the cases will allow it, sure beats taking them off and putting them on)This strap is very comfortable on an acoustic/electric guitar, probably more so than on a bass as it is supporting less weight. Due to the width of the strap it distributes the weight over a larger area, meaning less pressure on any specific area. This makes it very comfortable.I might change all my guitar straps from 2"" to 3"" now that I've had a taste of comfort.If you aren't comfortable playing, than you are distracted which removes you from the creative moment. This helps keep you in the moment and in the groove and it don't cost a fortune, plus it holds a pick or two.I like my phat strap just fine."
982,630,4.0,I like the 3&#34; wide for my bass. Fits nice and made well. Seems to be secure fit (leather holders are thick).
870,630,3.0,"I got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks I have on different bass. The fact that it is wide is nice. As others have said you need to slide the padding down, but you can't beat these for the money."
87,630,4.0,"Planet Waves makes good stuff.  Take the load off your shoulder from that old Jazz bass, and get a padded 3 inch wide strap. It's long enough to allow my bass to rest at arm's length.  I can adjust it to fit my acoustic guitar, which I hold much higher, and check out the little 'pick-pocket'.  I like these well enough that I have four of them."
450,630,4.0,"This bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price. BTW, that's all I have to say, so don't MAKE me type more."
592,630,4.0,"This strap was great I was glad to find this well made wide strap. This Bass strap spreads the weight more even and reduces the shoulder and back pain,he loves it. Just the job."
876,630,4.0,"It's not fancy, but it's well though out, and you can't beat the value. The edges don't cut your neck, and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want. Like others, I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment. The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want, and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed. Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass."
392,630,4.0,I am pleased with the strap and the low price. I bought it for a very large body &#34;F&#34; hole electric guitar.
412,673,4.0,"This is a nice leather mandolin strap.  Fits fine on my cheap Rogue A type mandolin.  Amazingly, it is made in Canada, not China!  The leather is very smooth and flexible, not stiff like some cheap straps."
1359,673,4.0,"serves its purpose; worked better when I added a quick-disconnect attachment; quality finish, comfortable, and enough range to adjust as needed;"
1216,673,4.0,"I am so happy with this product that after buying the first one, I bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin."
293,673,2.0,"This is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin.I would have given it five stars except mine arrived with a paper label glued to the back of the strap, which when peeled off left a sticky spot on the strap where it would press against the mandolin finish."
240,673,2.0,OK quality and certainly better than a piece of rope.  I found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile.
913,673,4.0,This strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product.  Well made and sturdy. It would be hard to beat.
1085,62,0.0,"If you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap.  The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part.  I will be ordering the Levys ""Leather Mandolin Strap (Walnut)""."
31,62,4.0,"Not that many good products/accessories for ukuleles.  This one is perfect in size and price.  However, you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock.  Just give it a little thought.  Overall it's fine."
35,62,4.0,"Other reviewers have mentioned that the slot that goes over the strap peg is tight. They are correct, but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle. For the bread this is a great strap. Buy one and see what I mean. My uncle played with a couple of old boot laces for a strap back in the day. Treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot..."
38,62,2.0,"It was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin.  At least it won't fall off soon!  I just got another mandolin with no button, and this strap has no way to attach to it."
43,62,4.0,"If you need it, good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated, this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument, since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap, Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
306,21,2.0,"isn't it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description? The product is great value for money and worth while buying, if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units. Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit. They don't!! Dumb of them, as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately, which I later did. Seems like nit picking? Well, it's not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me. Sloppy isn't it?"
1055,21,4.0,"Used one of these when I forgot mine and loved it so much, I had to get my own.-- Small, takes up only one spot on a power strip or outlet-- Long cord is great!-- Enough juice to power all of my pedals simultaneouslyTotally worth the buy. Do it!"
274,21,4.0,"Highly recommend this adapter because it is transformerless and has high current capacity for powering numerous guitar effect pedals. It is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise. Also, it is designed so that it will plug into a power strip without covering adjacent receptacles. Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product."
1051,21,3.0,"It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items, including my Line 6 wireless receivers, Shure wireless receivers, and several other pedals like my Cry Baby, etc., all at once.  However, the transmitter for my Shure wireless in-ear monitor, which requires less power than any of the other two items combined, will not run, even by itself, when powered by the 1 Spot.  Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own, and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with.  For most of my stuff it works great, and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords."
17,21,4.0,"I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months, used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
568,21,3.0,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this, so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box, I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals, then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain, so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!, connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine, I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it, I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right, so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it, so it work as it is supposed to."
650,21,4.0,This is a great invention.  I have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this.  It really saves on batteries and extension chords.  It is well worth the money.
953,21,4.0,"This is the answer to your all your power supply needs. If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) You need this. It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug. It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals. It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain. It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in. and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing. you'll save enough money to pay for it in no time, not having to buy batteries. Get it, you'll love it! I"
1018,21,3.0,I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is.
683,21,4.0,"I choose this rating cause it is the best Adapter I've found. I like that is doesn't heat up or even get warm although I only use it with my looper. Another plus +++ is the length of the cord is the best cause I don't need to use and extension cord with it. One less thing to set up, carry around and worry about. I Truly recommend this One Spot Adapter to everyone."
1326,765,3.0,I didn't do the sound quality test but i have another one of these and it works just fine. I just tested if all the plugs work and they do. If i'll get some sound problems i will write an update but i'm confident that it's going to be ok.
98,765,3.0,"This plug works very well.  I like the right angle connectors.  I have a Korg Pitchblack plus that can act as a powersource for other pedals.  It included a multi-plug cable, but not a right angle one.  The connectors kind of stuck out and got in the way on my pedalboard.  This works much better."
1093,765,4.0,This original plug fits the purpose perfectly! Quality and precision! The plugs don't take up space (couldn't be smaller) and the wiring is pliable and easy to rout in and out of spaces on your pedalboard. Keep away from the cheap imitations that rob you of space and are hard to work with! Make sure what you receive is a One Spot product in its original packaging (check images).
332,765,4.0,I've got 5 effects hooked up to this thing. It fits beautifully and powers all of them at once. Have no problems with this. I recommend it!
1104,765,4.0,"Arrived on time ... works as intended and maybe more.One day, I was pondering how best to de-clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V-12V DC equipment on my table or rack. Fortunately, I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant ... my problem was solved. I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack. I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source. Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage. Been working without a problem to this day."
574,765,4.0,This is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power.  Its easy to install and keeps things simple.  No more extra messy cabling.  Glad I got it.  Thanks to Amazon for the quick delivery.
888,765,3.0,Bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesn't cost much.  I just attached it to an existing adapter and voila.
274,765,4.0,High-quality cable for expanding the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V power adapter. Distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards.
376,765,4.0,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board, this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs, combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further, with the transformer being well away from the board, there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
1051,765,3.0,"Good quality, wired correctly, can't complain.  If you use the ""One Spot"" power adaptor, you need to have a couple of these laying around.  It's probably not practical, but I wish they made more sizes.  In one configuration, I only need two plugs, in another configuration I need three, and yet another configuration I need five, so I actually bought a few of the fives, and cut them off to the length I need."
607,765,4.0,"This helped me a lot building my pedal board, actually think its kinda overpriced, but its really really good.I have 2 of these actually.I recommend this product."
17,765,4.0,"What can I say? It does what it should.  5 pedals on a chain runs safely without crazy hiss and hum on my rig. Of course, if you're running a chain of drive/distortion pedals, you're asking for it.Works great for me. Zero complaints."
568,765,3.0,"Nice daisy chain, If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter, just make sure to avoid using all the connectors, since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues, if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem, I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions, so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah, and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
586,765,4.0,"Works like a charm. Powers up to five 9V effects, using one power supply. I am using four plugs and it has worked flawlessly. No more dead 9V batteries. Some effects eat 9V batteries like a 6 year old with a cone of cotton candy."
650,765,4.0,"I bought an extension for it, and so this plug has allowed me to stop using eight batteries. Hard not to like that."
953,765,4.0,If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) you need this and the 1 spot adapter. It will save you a lot of money on batteries and aggravation when you battery runs out on stage. It's worth it's weight in gold. and RockIsland Sound sends it out FAST!. You can count on me for future purchases! Thanks Guys!
1356,765,4.0,I used this along with a Dunlop DC adapter and it all fits nicely.  I'm powering a Zoom MS-50G and a Fulltone OCD.  It will pay for itself over a year in saved battery costs.
38,765,4.0,"I only have two pedals, but that was one outlet spot too many, and it really makes a difference when you're onstage with only one power strip.  Now I just wish I had an attachment that would let me charge my laptop and iPhone from the same plug as the pedals.  Can't always get what you want."
611,765,4.0,"I bought this because I had already bought a ""1 spot"" plug but as i gained pedals, I needed something to power them without buying more adapters and this is greatest way to solve that problem. Highly recommended."
1268,765,4.0,"One Spots come with an 8-pedal multi plug. If you only have 4 pedals, or lets say you have 12, powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly. The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren't plugged into pedals. Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces, alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs. Very nice quality, just as with all one spot stuff. Great price, great purchase."
1148,765,4.0,Completely quite. Connected with no problem. I own two.
1166,765,3.0,"Good long cable works well with all my pedals, well worth it to get ride of annoying 9 v batteries."
575,765,4.0,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was), you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying, especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer, and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is, you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals, off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT, I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short, buy this product, it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
814,765,4.0,Works. Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it. Nothing else to say. Thanks.
911,765,4.0,"...thing is great for multi-pedal use!  This is a must if you have any of the Danelectro/FAB pedals.  As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, you purchase the power supply (search for Danelectro DA-1 9.6V AC Adapter) and this cable and you're good to go for up to 5 pedals!  No more battery swaps."
920,765,4.0,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank, which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals, decent quality, and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
683,765,4.0,"This Multi-plug works great and has enough plugs for 5 pedals. I only needed it for two pedals which are not in a case, so there is some extra plugs hanging on the floor but is better than setting up another wall wart each pedal. If needed in the future I have these extra plugs. I recommend this Multi-Plug to everyone!"
1202,765,4.0,great little cable.  now i power all my pedals with one power supply.  makes setting up for gigs much easier
1242,468,4.0,"Every guitar I've ever cared about has had this strap on it. I must've bought about 10 of these over my lifetime, and I don't regret it even in the slightest."
927,468,4.0,"The DiMarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available.  The Dunlops tend to release if they're bumped, and the Schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments.  The DiMarzio models are extremely comfortable, easy to install, and very easy to use."
762,468,3.0,"I love these straps.  I have them installed on all of my guitars.  After a Dunlop lock failure, I decided to change over.  Our band's drummer and guitarist both used and recommened these straps so I gave them a chance.  They are amazing, much more comfortable then one of those bulky, heavy leather straps and just as strong.  I was worried that the plastic clips wouldn't hold up, but they do.  I feel 100% secure that my guitar will not fall.  They look good as well and they are easily adjustable.  My transmitter pack slid on with ease and I was ready to go.  A lot of bands I have seen on the road use these straps.I didn't rate these straps 5 stars however, because of a few reasons:1- I play heavy guitars, I was concerned about the screws that came with the straps.  For a standard, lightweight guitar they may be fine, but for say a Gibson, or my Agile Intrepid Pro, I wanted more security.  I took a slighty wider and longer screw than provided, covered it and filled the install hole with epoxy, and drilled it in.  It holds incredible, its NOT coming out now for sure.2- I use the black, white, and blue colors.  They discolor very easily.  Through sweat, dirt, and cigarette smoke, they eventually start to look nasty.  I would suggest going with the black for this reason.3- I put my confidence in these straps 100%, but I wouldn't start doing guitar swings with them.  Its just a plastic clip, and anything can fail.  I've seen guys electrical/duct tape the clips for extra support and they've all been able to get away with swinging their guitars around, but personally I choose to play it safe (as I lost my best guitar to a failed straplock during a spin).All DiMarzio products are incredible. If you want something light and comfy that looks sleek and will keep your guitar protected, I highly suggest these straps."
301,468,4.0,"Works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks. I'd use it for lightweight guitars. Using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder. I always suggest this strap to ""kids"" who spin their guitars while on stage. This strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage"
149,468,4.0,"Well made product, strong and looks good. I love this strap, try one, you wont be dissapointed. Like always, Dimarzio products, are simply the best."
1348,509,4.0,just arrived in good shape. Polish w/ an expansive polishing cloth. Almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths.
1272,509,4.0,Better than Dunlop polish. It really holds up well and leaves a really nice shine. Mine didn't come with a polishing cloth like the picture shows though.
539,509,3.0,"The Product Itself Is Good, Shined My Guitar Up Nicely, The Cloth I Received Was A Black Microfiber Cloth With The Ernie Ball Logo, I Must Say That The Cloth Is Very Nice, It's Soft And Lint Free, So The Cloth Alone Was Worth Purchasing This Polish, After The Polish Is Gone I Will Probably Try Another Product, I Need Something That Will Conceal The Fine Scratches On My Guitar Finish, Probably Like A Guitar Wax, But All In All This Product Seems Good For Wiping Down The Guitar After Playing, Keeps The Instrument Nice And Shiny. It Removes Smudges And Fingerprints Quite Nicely, Not A Bad Product, It Arrived Within A Couple Of Days, I Am Satisfied With This Purchase"
615,509,4.0,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily, water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges, fingerprints, etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free, fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area, so be careful to avoid spraying strings, pickups, etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
1424,509,3.0,The cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth. Just feels right for the job..
752,509,4.0,Although The cloth I got was black and not yellow just pointing that out. It works amazingly for my guitar now its like a mirror. I can see my reflection perfectly clear.
310,566,3.0,"Nice cables.  So far I've not had any problems with them, but haven't put them through a lot of use just yet.  Also have the Monster audio cables that work just as well, but cost more!  I'll have to see over time which brand out lasts the other."
264,566,4.0,"this cable is perfect! great sound quality and durability. I will not buy any other cable except planet waves! best bang for the buck for any working musician hands down, yes there are cheaper cables ,,but they don't sound as good or last as long, Planet Waves is the way to go"
608,566,4.0,I have many Planet Waves cables. They are all very well made.  I like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts. An excellent value. I would highly recommend.
589,566,0.0,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but I didn't want any down time, so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time, and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. So, I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable."
890,566,4.0,"Look no further...You will not be let down by the build quality of these cables nor by the sound quality. I have a Monster M ROCK-12 cable. Put up against these, I fail to distinguish the difference in sound. The only difference? Price. These cables are the ONLY cable I will ever use from now on. Go ahead, buy them. You will love them."
812,566,4.0,I love this cable. They last for ever and NEVER cause buzz or noise. These are the only ones I buy now.
1065,566,3.0,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable, good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best, but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where, cable owner, etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a ""feel good"" purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
979,566,2.0,"As other reviewers have noted, the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to ""click"" into the jack of your guitar or amp. Easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about 1/8"" then the cable is fine.Other than that I like the cable construction and the large sized ends."
7,566,3.0,"You can't beat these beefy thick cords for the price however some do have a flaw, On some pedals and guitars they pop out cause the length of the metal shaft is too short so it doesn't click into the jack. measured the length and they are short by about 1mm or so.I go a razor blade and carefully trimmed some of the rubber insulation and that took care of the problem. Minor but annoying detail when the cord pops out of your guitar!"
340,566,4.0,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami, Canare, etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors, but with these, I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days, so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
60,566,4.0,"These cables are very high quality, they feel hefty and durable.  I wish I'd gotten one longer than 5 feet though since I can only play close to my amp with two five footers.  Oh, well."
588,566,4.0,"I've been using this one for about a year now, with no problems. I really like the durability and clear sound quality."
277,566,4.0,"First off, I'm a big fan of D'Addario strings and their Planet Waves division.  So when I needed a quality cable with a right angle plug, I got one of theirs.  I don't really know if it's better than other brands or not.  But it does the job and it's well made."
374,566,4.0,"I was using the standard version of these, I saw these at Amazon and figured I'd give them a try.These cables are a little more stiff than the standard cables I was using however the ends seem much more well belt.Doesn't make a difference in the sound? I don't know but I am satisfied with this purchase."
542,417,3.0,"I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9.5s and after some use, I am kind of disappointed.CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings, just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4.99 new with free 2 day shipping, this is a no brainer.CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings, but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for. I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with, they sound much fuller. I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s."
533,417,4.0,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George, I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
411,417,3.0,"These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. I would prefer if the B string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the A were 0.032 instead of 0.034. As such, I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. But if you're not too picky, this will suit you very well."
175,417,4.0,"this is as light as you want to go on a LP scale length.. about the same tension as 9s on a strat.so, don't want 9s, and 10s too tight then 9.5s it is.. nice strings"
366,417,4.0,guitar string 9.5 between 9 and 10.  Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9.
711,417,4.0,"I bought these D'Addario strings after going back and forth between 9s and 10s and have really come to like these sizes.  They keep a nice, slinky feel and keep a lot of tone through many hours of playing.  I'm really happy with this D'Addario purchase!"
717,348,4.0,"Honestly, the strings are great. They sound great and they are (relatively) inexpensive for bass strings. I love them, and they will be what I buy the next time I change out as well. Highly recommended."
1101,348,3.0,"I bought a bass from this site, and as much as I love the thing, I'm not an expert.  I popped my E string over-tightening it when I was setting it up.  I replaced the factory strings with these.  I'm told it sounds better now.  I think so as well, but I can't quite quantify it."
1263,348,4.0,"These are super strings. They will last and last and last, and give you great sound. Easy to put on and tune."
186,348,4.0,"I'm normally an acoustic guitar player but recently acquired my first electric ever.  It was used, and the strings were dismal sounding, so I bought these D'Addario EXLs.  They hold pitch beautifully.  My only complaint has to do with my guitar technique, not the strings.  Having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars, the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric don't like my ""heavy-handed"" approach to pressing down the strings.  As a result, the highly bendable lighter strings become sharp up near the nut until I relax and enjoy playing with a very light touch.  It will take some getting used to -- or else I'll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing.  All of that said, the strings are pure joy to play."
368,348,4.0,"a solid favorite around my house. fat and deep, snappy when needed. you can definitly pay more, and you may want a more specific tone, but these are a safe bet that always sound good"
503,348,3.0,"Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover, Geddy Lee, and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them, you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
911,348,2.0,...strings I use D'Addario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great.  They have a really nice sound and don't cost an arm and a leg...
876,348,4.0,"I keep going back and forth between DR High Beams and these. My teacher really likes the High Beams, but these are half the price, and the tone is just great and, surely a new set of these are going to have more &#34;oomph&#34; than a set of High Beams I keep a little too long because they cost more. . .  Recommended."
548,348,3.0,So these are  pretty great strings. Not much to say. The price is really good. About ten dollars a set which is really good.
717,108,4.0,"I was an Ernie Ball guy for a long time. But I was getting pissed because the Ernies kept corroding so quickly. So I tried these, and they seem to hold up better. There are coated strings that will last longer, but I don't like spending so much on strings. And of course, they sound excellent too. Stock up!!"
464,108,4.0,"They are easier to play on the the medium gauge strings that came with my guitar. I am a beginner so although they still hurt my fingers they were an improvement. They also have a pretty color to them, and the ends of the strings (the ones that go in the holes during installation) are color coded and come with a chart, which makes things easy."
778,108,4.0,I've use these strings for years. I play often and like to change strings often. I can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs. They hold tune very we (at least on my guitar) indoors and out. I'd highly recommend them.
171,108,4.0,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull, and I absolutely love their sound, feel, and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes, these strings have a great, uplifting sound to them, hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them, nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel, clean and smooth. When replacing, I ran into no problems, quick and easy. I love the strings and their price, definitely will stick with this brand as well."
1135,108,4.0,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers, or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that, but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the ""ball ends"". To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
1372,108,4.0,Only issue they break easily. But they last a long time and sound great. Well worth the money. Crisp and fresh tone for a long time.
1221,108,4.0,These are the only strings I use on my acoustic/electric. Love the sealed bags to keep the air tight seal. Prefer the Extra lights.
427,108,3.0,"These sound great and last a long time for me.  Plus, they're reasonably priced.  Put 'em in your case and don't be unprepared.  I like squirrels."
742,108,4.0,I play resonator guitars open tuned. These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open &#34;A&#34; tuning. I recently tried multiple other brands and gauges (almost every B string snapped / to C#) only to come back to these... Only wish they came in packs of 10 cause I go through about three sets a month (3 guitars)
1015,108,4.0,"Great guitar string at a reasonable price. I highly recommend these acoustic strings, they are also available in light or heavy guageif you prefer. I like the EJ 17 medium string for my rhythm acoustic guitar."
556,108,3.0,Well made. Enjoyable to play. Stay in tune well. The sound is clear and warm on my Yamaha and my Martin. Right now I am experimenting with different strings so I cant say if they are better than others. I personally like the sound better than the Martin ESs I have tried but that is a personal choice. Let your guitar be the judge.
458,108,4.0,"I thought it was a good deal when I saw the original price, the discount stated it was $8 off. Instead it was only $2 cheaper than buying at my local music store. Other than the price, the strings work great on my guitar. Sounds amazing. I'll definitely be buying more of these."
534,108,4.0,I prefer the light strings but you have to allow them to stretch a little or you might break on when changing. The lighter the less tension you should use. I love the price and they last me quite a while.
372,108,4.0,"This gauge is perfect for my 1970 Gibson J-50. The phospher-bronze alloy wrap brings out hidden tonal ""snap"" in this old, rather heavily-braced guitar. The may be too bright for a lighter instrument, but they really shine on my old guitar."
140,108,4.0,"I will keep this short.  The price is unbelievable, it's nice to have three sets in a box and these are the best acoustic strings on the market.  That's only my opinion and everyone has one......so many will disagree.I have an regular acoustic and an acoustic electric and strung both with these strings.  It made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar.  I find that most inexpensive guitars have cheap strings, most can be vastly improved with something as simple as new strings.  I really believe in these strings.  When I find a good thing, I am hooked and I will not use anything BUT these on anything acoustic.  On a guitar, strings are everything.  The tone feel and bend is what's important.  These are very light and VERY easy on the fingers, unlike clunky stock strings on most acoustics.  I guess they think you need big, think strings to produce volume....not so.  Some will disagree saying they break if they're too thin.  I would rather have a shorter life with strings, getting a pure beautiful, rich sound than have a long lasting flat string.  My thick stock strings were killing my fingers.  These are effortless to play and sound so sweet and mellow, just like an acoustic should sound.Again, someone will chime in and bash me for saying this...but I would put my inexpensive Yamaha up against guitars costing 10 times what I paid.  I have no plans of changing brands now I've made the string switch.  Some say thin strings break easily, but you should change strings often anyway.  I can do a string change-over in about 15 minutes on a bad day.  It's worth the effort.  I don't plan on hammering my acoustic anyway.  That's what the Fender is for.  AND it's not that I'm cheap either.  I own 18 guitars, 16 of which are electrics.  3 Gibson Les Paul's, 2 Fender Strats (one American) a couple of Dillions (another great find) and some other nice guitars.My Acoustic is just an inexpensive Yamaha 700 but is a very nice guitar for the money.  But after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive Martin.  It didn't take me long to throw a set of these on my acoustic electric and got the same results.5 stars in my book, more if they'd allow that.  There are no other options unless someone gives me a set that blow me away."
137,108,4.0,"Low end made in China dreadnaught acoustic - Bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high end.Here's what I've found. The way you string the guitar makes a difference. With practice I've become more proficient.Curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate. Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.I use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.Then I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing, - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.Try to practice for about an hour daily. The tone as I say is pretty darn good. Played a high end adirondack, rosewood, name brand and was disappointed that it didn't sound that much better to me."
1333,108,4.0,have to reorder soon  great strings for the money. I play guitar with a cou[ple of my buddies and they love them too  sound quaility is great
1204,108,3.0,"I tried these strings on my Zager guitar.  the are certainly ok and play fine.  they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru Zager.  just a little cheaper in cost perhaps.  maybe they will last longer.  I had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity I put in there for the guitar wood (I live in hot and very dry Arizona).  these have not rusted, so far."
1065,108,4.0,"D'Addario Strings Are Simply The Best!The brightest tone, normal lifespan, fair prices,, and louder than the rest!I have played guitar professionally for over 27 years.These strings are the best all around for tone, clarity, punch and volume.Don't be fooled by strings that may last longer or have coating on them just to sacrifice clear tone.One a side note. I hate their new packaging.They used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves. Then about a decade ago they started winding them individually, but placed them loosely inside a plastic sealed pouch. NOW, they wind up two at a time, and place them inside a plastic pouch. Arrgh!Same great strings and tone, but now you have to unwind them from their &#34;pairs&#34; and lay them out two-at-a-time...kind of aggravating, but NO FRIGGIN' WAY WOULD I EVER USE ANOTHER STRING! - lol!I compared these (and other D'Addario's) to other manufacturers...they were much louder and cleaner.Don't be an idiot. Buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately."
952,108,3.0,"D'Arrario does sell some fine strings.  While these are not my very, very favorites (strictly because I prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings), they still do just fine--much better than some other brands I've tried.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  Good-sounding and playing all-around strings."
576,108,4.0,"these strings are great with my acoustics-however, lately i've been using electric strings instead. they work well, sound great, and i believe they really compliment my playing."
477,108,4.0,My favorite strings for 30 years. Have used D'Addario strings since the late 70's. Always a great sound at a great price.
465,108,4.0,"far as i can tell, good strings. They do the job and they feel great. Not much to say...I got exactly what I expected."
236,108,4.0,"Good strings for the price, nice ring to them.  So far they seem to last and were a bit louder than my last strings although they were flat round and did expect them to be very loud."
793,108,3.0,"I have used all kinds of strings. These are what I use on a regular basis. They work, they sound great, and their longevity is impressive. Most of all, they are cheap."
867,108,4.0,Excellent strings. Beautiful solid tone and no buzzing.
744,108,4.0,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time, in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound, even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge, D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green, the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory), the high E is silver, and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great, but the first few times, it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string, hands down, after almost 40 years of playing."
1042,108,1.0,"Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\"
1336,108,4.0,I've used these strings for longer than I'd care to admit.  String sound is a personal thing.  These work better for me than any others I've tried.  To my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum. The five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste. Others may prefer a different sound.
1001,108,4.0,I put these strings on every acoustic I own.  They sound great and are priced right!  You can't go wrong with D'Addario strings!
1356,108,4.0,"I played with light acoustic strings for a long time.  I tried these and they make for much easier action.Do you lose tone quality that you would get with heavier strings?  ... maybe, but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings.I'll probably stick with extra light for awhile.  They sound great to me, and I can play longer without getting sore fingers."
1314,108,4.0,"Great strings, fully recommended. I have been playing guitar for about 30 years, I only use D'Addarios & Dean Markleys. Good sound, long lasting."
1249,108,4.0,"I'm new to acoustic so I'm not too sure how things go, but from what I have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good. A little to thick for my style though. They make a very deep and loud noise. I prefer placing electric strings on acoustic. They sound much better and aren't quite as loud."
987,108,3.0,"If you're a musician, there are those things that you gotta have on a regular basis and for guitar, strings are one of those things. I give these 4 stars rather than 5 just because I know there are better strings out there. However, these ones are great. I like the sound they provide and the price is nice."
1160,108,4.0,"These strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers.  My acoustic guitars seem to like them too, all except my 12-string. I have not switched form Martin strings on that guitar."
905,108,4.0,"Not onlh are these good for the price, but they have become my new fave.  I switch acoustic strings 3-4 times a month on my 2 main guitars.  I gig 1-2 times a month.  These last long, without compromising the tone.  Great price too!  I tried every brand until I got to these.  Not sure why I did not try them earlier :(.  Probably because I was drinking the Elixir Koolaide."
928,108,4.0,"I really love the fact that they are color coded so you don't mix your strings up and easy on my fingers. I love the price, they are a very good brand and easy to install. Highly recommend"
711,108,4.0,"These are my go-to acoustic strings.  They are a quality string with great sustain and clarity.  I bought Elixir Nanos to compare, and I did like them, but I think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these. I'll be sticking with these for the long run."
627,108,4.0,Extra Light gives good action for my small guitar. Not so hard on the fingers. Tone is not bad but not same as 11 or 12 gauge.
189,108,3.0,"The strings sound great on my full size acoustic - nice bright, but warm tone, full bodied sound - but not so great on my 3/4 size guitar."
101,108,3.0,"D'Addario ALWAYS puts out a nice product.  The E and B strings never have enough coating, but still.  In comparison to others, they do a good job of getting the music out there in a bright and sustained manner."
329,108,4.0,"This brand has never disappointed me, regardless of the diameter of the strings. To me they just sound complete. Even the light strings don't sound tinny, which amazed me compared to other big names. They complement my Washburns very well. Though they are not top of the line models, I often get compliments like &#34;you're guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone&#34;. But it's been a trial & error for me. I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned."
983,108,4.0,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food, musicians, movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
730,108,4.0,good strings
414,108,4.0,"i love these strings.  i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these, i really enjoyed them.  after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase.  no desire to test other strings.  especially after this bundle/value."
1258,108,3.0,"Arrived beautifully with plenty of time to forward this on to another guitar enthusiest who rarely changes her strings, tune."
736,108,4.0,"DAddario's are my go to strings for my Washburn and Ibanez acoustics.  They sustain well, great tone, tune well, and last for a good while between changes."
85,108,2.0,"I gave these strings a try, but I don't care for them that much. I have always used SP;s or Elixir's, and I don't think that will change after trying these."
933,108,4.0,"I'm enjoying using this priced-right set of strings. I put these strings on my Martin guitar after receiving my new DVD from customerservice@peghead.nl entitled ""How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar"" by Eltjo Haselhoff, whose preview of this GREAT DVD I found on YouTube. See the preview and look at other Youtube videos of Eltjo - you'll want to order the DVD immediately."
331,108,3.0,"I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great, but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs, but then again, they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though, it's hard to knock on them too much."
896,108,0.0,"The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.Luckily I bought the three pack.But I can't recommend this product."
1318,108,4.0,"Excellent steel guitar strings, each string has a color coded end, each 6-string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where.  Purchased a 3 set box, and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness.  I went with the mediums.  Try the light if you are a beginner."
438,108,4.0,"Anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing.  The tonal qualities, weight, feel, materials and all other qualities / variables combine to make strings your very own personal favorite.  For me these strings bring it all together and are my string of choice for all 12 acoustic electrics I use to play what I consider rock ballads using my strumming-style of play.I love the feel and tone of these strings for my style of play and my equipment set-up.  I do have some issues with these strings, but overall, I'm willing to put up with the issues for the overall performance I get from the EJ26 strings.  The issues include what I think may be premature breakage.  I do not play &#34;hard&#34;, I play long (playing several hours daily), but I play rock ballads using a somewhat softer strumming style.  (I definitely do not &#34;pound&#34; on the strings - I like to think of it as fairly &#34;gentle&#34; strumming.)  Yet, I seem to manage to break the high E & B strings on a regular basis (by playing, not by over tuning).  Some of this can be expected, but what bothers me is the frequency with which I'm breaking G strings.  I simply don't think these wound G's should be breaking at all with my style of playing.  I've noticed that the current &#34;most helpful critical review&#34; mentions this same problem.  I change strings frequently so I don't think this is the reason they are breaking.Overall, I am willing to put-up with what I believe to be some premature breakage (especially with the G string), for the other qualities that draw me to the EJ26 strings.  They sound great for my style of play, equipment, and set-up.  They feel great.  I love 'em and will continue to buy quantities of them for my 12 acoustic electrics.  I just wish I had a better feeling about the premature breakage."
860,108,4.0,"It has been a while since I put new strings on my acoustic guitar. These went on with no problems. They have a brassy sound to them. Since purchasing them, they still ring nicely."
855,108,4.0,My favorite string from back in the '60s when I had my own guitar shop. Great strings and the best packaging.
517,108,4.0,"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews, the quality of these strings is excellent.They last with great tone for a reasonable time, and don't break.I just have a helpful hint for those people with little experience in re-stringing an acoustic guitar that has removable bridge pins. Put a crimp or bend in each string about 3/4 of an inch or so from the ball at the end, about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string, fairly sharp. Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on. Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar, out of the way of the pin. Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin! The pin should fit tightly into the hole, and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin, not below it. Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin. After pushing in the pin, you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut, and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole, keeping it tight. It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar, but I can't see in there to verify this is so, but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin! Not upward.Hope this helps some novices, I had to learn it this way myself."
519,108,4.0,"I have multiple guitars, for different styles.  I use these strings on my Ovation Legend, for acoustic leads.  Good tone, good sustain, and they stay in tune.  I play 2 gigs a week on average, and practice everyday.  These strings get a workout, and I change strings when I start to lose sustain.  That's why I buy the 10 packs, so I always have spare sets on hand."
760,108,4.0,I have not used mine yet but my brother in law says it looks like i got the same strings on my guitar already i trust him he knows more about guiatars than i do
629,108,4.0,"I needed to replace the strings on my acoustic, and chose these D'Addario's based on price and the favorable reviews given them by other users. I'm glad I chose them, as they play easily and have a nice sound. The lighter gauge allows for rapid yet sure fingering, and makes 'bending' notes for a blues effect a cinch. In fact, I occasionally have to remind myself there's no longer any need to press down nearly as hard as I previously had to when playing the heavier-gauge strings my guitar came with. In short, these strings make playing so much more enjoyable, I wish I'd gotten them from the start. But then, without the comparison of playing with the old strings, I might not appreciate playing with these half as much as I do now."
1240,108,4.0,"Tried them all. These are the best sounding in my book. They last pretty long for non-coated strings and play nicely, too."
780,108,4.0,"I recently acquired a Guild six string that I strung with my usual EJ16 strings, however, it just wasn't playing or sounding as good as I knew it could.  After tweaking the action and restringing with EJ17 Mediums, that Guild has sounds great with plenty of punch & power to spare.Overall, I rely on D'Addario strings for all my instruments. What's not to love about a 300+ year-old, family-owned company that (beginning with the days of catgut) has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations?  Beyond great tone & playability, these suckers are reliable as all get-out. These days if a string breaks, I know right away I need to check the nut & saddle, because these strings don't snap unless something on the instrument caused damage. In fact, I used to snap strings every other performance before I learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use NOTHING but D'Addario strings. I haven't broken a string during a performance in years, and believe me, I ain't being gentle with 'em."
202,108,3.0,"D'addario makes a pretty good string, but I'd have to say I prefer the Elixir. The sound is a little brighter, and the strings last longer with Elixir. Don't get me wrong though, I still like these.  If there's a sale, I'll buy some more."
58,108,4.0,it's tri pack with great quality strings on good deal! i purchased 2 of this set and it works great. it sounds balanced (warm and bright). i prefer change strings often so i can't afford to do that with expensive set of strings. this one is affordable and make my guitar sound good! anyone needs string go for it!
1324,108,2.0,"I have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings 4,5,6 within 3 days of installing.  I play professionally and have a lot of experience installing strings, nothing wrong on the guitar.  Hopefully the next set will be better"
55,108,4.0,"I usually play classical (nylon string) guitar, but have an Ovation deep-bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out, I never have found strings that I really liked (don't ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory.  One of those duh things I didn't even think of until just now).Based on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon, I purchased this triple-set of strings.  Instant gratification.  First, they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis (no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days, but these retained tune fairly well).  The sound is excellent, the playability comfy.  The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations:* First, three sets for $13 (currently).  Cannot beat the value for price.* BRILLIANCE.  What many people call &#34;bright&#34;, brilliance is the opposite of &#34;dull&#34;.  Some strings sound dull right out of the package.  These strings are brilliant, bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar.* TONE.  The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through, no hint of &#34;tinniness&#34;, &#34;plunk&#34; or &#34;twang&#34;.* MELLOW.  Mellow is difficult to define, but the best definition I've heard is, &#34;Ah, that sounds nice.&#34;  Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar.  It's a pleasantness that doesn't grate on your ears when you pluck a string.  These strings are medium-mellow, just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep.  : )* BALANCE.  At first the E overtoned the b and e.  But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out.  The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass.* COMFORT.  The 12-53mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers.  Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars.  Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action.  These strings are just right-- especially the 53mm E, which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY:  These are excellent strings, which doesn't surprise me since I've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years.  Martin and GHS are both good strings, but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try.  Highly recommended."
1108,108,4.0,"I love the strings so far, just put them on my Jasmine by Takamine guitar today (2-20-14) and they sound amazing, very bright tone, I will be using D'Addario strings from now on, very pleased with them."
699,108,4.0,These are great strings. Nice bright tone. The three pack was the best deal when I ordered them. Get some!
1022,117,3.0,"Tried D'Adario EJ36 Extra Light 12-string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic, and the EJ11 Light 6-string set on my Takamine.  No trouble stringing or tuning either set.  With the 0.012-0.53 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension, and they still sound fine.  Good acoustic, but a rather strong metalic, sound with a nice ""ring"", and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings.  Sound does deaden over time, as expected, but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B non-wound strings, losing some of their ""ring"".  (Tried Elixir's for better longevity, but they did not sound as good to me as these D'Adario's.)"
1210,117,3.0,"I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic. The gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone. I might try a lighter set next time, but these have a good clear tone from low to high, and are fairly comfortable."
565,117,4.0,These and Reds are my favorite acoustic strings. These are a little brighter than Reds and are best for live playing. The strings are well made and I've never had an issue with quality.
372,117,4.0,"80/20 strings ""blend"" really well on my cheap Jasmine guitar. They improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit. Phosphor Bronze were way too bright on the Jasmine. 80/20 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out. They did nothing to help my over-braced 1970 Gibson J-50, though. Phosphor Bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap."
1241,117,4.0,Sound can be subjective and strings are a matter of debate that can go on forever.  Usually I wouldn't notice a significant difference between brands (except for any coated string that all sound like crap to my ears) but when I put D'addarios on my 000 I just couldn't believe the improvement over the Martins.  It took dozens of string changes and gage experiments but now its clear.  These consistently sound the most balanced and responsive... With the crisp clear highs that my guitar lacks when strung with anything else.I'm glad the search is over for awhile and I have a solid sweet baseline to experiment from here!
962,117,4.0,"I love these strings...they sound awesome on my acoustic. However, they do not last long, but that is the price you pay for a good sound. Not strings recommended for beginners, due to the bigger gauge."
391,117,4.0,"I bought a case of these.  I can't handle #12 strings and the sound of #10 is terrible.  I prefer #12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands.  not the fingers but the hand and wrists, so .011 strings are what I use.  I am not sure if they get dirty and get corrosion but they are my main strings and I love the low price too!!"
1201,117,4.0,"I have many so-called travel size acoustic guitars and have changed out all of the over sized strings that were installed on them (typically 12-54's) with these 10-47's (or 11-52's for beefy 7/8 and 3/4 scale guitars) in all cases, has brought the smaller guitars from duds to nice playing instruments.Three radical samples come to mind: On an old 1931 Gibson L1, the 12-54's pulled the bridge out.On an SX Traveler, you could not hear the Low E until I got rid of the 12-54's.On my Lil Martin, the lower bout started to delam under the pressure of the bridge pull.Short scale acoustic guitars are someplace between a full size acoustic and a Ukulele and in most cases are not set up for heavier gauge strings (even though the manufacturers insist on delivering them this way) due to their short scales, small frets, and light construction.If you can't hear the low E, or you are having problems fretting your strings, try these, what can it hurt?"
1051,76,3.0,"This pop filter is built like a tank compared to those cheap cloth and plastic versions that you get at the discount music stores, so it's a bit more expensive, but the quality and functionality is like night and day.  I use it in front of my Shure Beta 58A, and it's absolutely perfect."
880,76,4.0,"Watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the Yeti microphone.  Works like a champ, gets rid of all those unwanted noises!  Larger than I expected."
748,76,3.0,"works exactly like its ad says it would, eliminates pops and secondary noises in the background, easy to install, nice looking"
966,76,1.0,This is a beautiful shock mount. However for the price it didnt perform. The mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on P's and S's. Not worth the price.
1415,76,4.0,
848,76,3.0,It's works. Nice and small. Cool looking. Does the job. Seams sturdy enought. Might even get a blue mic. I use with a MoJave
1260,239,3.0,"Nice, works and no problem.Sound is good.Packaging is good.So far the so good, used for almost a month now."
223,239,4.0,These strings sound great. I was really impressed by the sound. They stay in tune very nicely. Great for beginners and intermediate players. I would recommend them.
748,239,4.0,"provide a very good sound, minimal stretching past a couple of days of setting it, good lows and highs, good value"
824,239,4.0,They are cheap and look good.  They also have a nice full sound and are holding up well.  Highly recommended.
58,239,4.0,"i've used d'addario strings for bass, electric, acoustic, and classic. even though this string was my first time use and it haven't failed me yet!! it's very stable and in tune all time while playing. highly recommand to other ppl"
55,239,4.0,"This string compares significantly to the Pro-Arte string.  The sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less.  It's so similar I contacted D'Addario to ask them what the difference was.  They stated the Pro-Arte strings are made of a better nylon and to more stringent specs... but in all honesty I wonder if the strings aren't identical but these marketed primarily to students and schools as a more economical string.Whatever is the actuality-- both sets are of quality manufacture.  They're D'Addario... and D'Addario never produces junk.  Their cheapest string is as good or better than more expensive strings in other brands.  I've never used a set of D'Addario in any classification of guitar that I didn't like.For those who are curious, I'd recommend doing what I did:  buy a set of these and a set of the Pro-Arte (they're both pretty inexpensive) and compare and see which you like best... or if you like both equally.  I think it would be good to get several reviews here of such a test between the two grades.  Whichever set one ultimately chooses, can't go wrong with the quality/price ratio."
1359,319,4.0,We bought this for my daughter's boyfriend; we saved it as the last gift to give on Christmas Day; he wrapped the strap around his neck and never put it back down; I still don't think it has come out of his hands for more than a few minutes; I believe he is very happy with his gift!
1408,319,4.0,I wanted a mandolin to fool around on and learn how to play. But didn't want to spend the same amount on something that I could for a new guitar. I am very pleased with the price and the quality. They take great care to pack it well so no worries their either. Buy this if you want a started that isn't bobo or a toy.
103,319,3.0,"Having bought 4 sizes of Ukulele, only to discover the Baritone Uku is much like a classical guitars lower 4 strings, I was curious for 60 bucks to see what it is like to play the Mandolin.  If you are interested in this style of play,  search You Tube videos and watch people,  I have not found anyone cutting Hotel California out on these things..I also didnt feel like I wanted to learn yet another chord set ( tried playing the electric guitar, even going and getting Rocksmith software to learn ( which is prety cool)  anyhow,  I changed the strings on the Baritone to be a ukulele..so this Mandolin has a very thin neck,  ( Maybe 1.25 width)  I have watched videos of other people playing and their necks  look wider, this is hard to fat finger ( yea I have fat fingers).My initial problem is this thing doesnt come delivered anywhere close to ready to go, the Saddle moves, is not hard mounted and has height adjusters..so once  I figured that out, and also put some 3 in 1 oil on the nut so when tuning the strings dont drag ( whether this is right or wrong I dont know, I did it regardless)I measured from the nut to the 12th fret, then the 12th fret to the Saddle and moved the saddle so both measurements were really close, if you are having tuning trouble withe yours, I bet this is the problem,,  with your Tuner set your strings Tight,,  that was another problem, this thing should twang high pitched, like the dude in the Geico commericals ( Again on You tube someone posted videos of tuning )  I also read buy a very stiff pick,  not for me,  I guess I am not gentle and smashed the strings,, couldnt keep the pick in my fingers. so I use a light one, the grounds for using the stiff was the pick will not bend and create delay I guess between the two strings ( same note), the light weight one  works well for me, ( when I do pick this thing up )it is not hard to tune, I use my Ukulele Snarks, and pick one string at a time,  it is a cute guitar regardless and I saw one for sale Used at Guitar Center for 75 bucks, same one.if you are someone who can play guitar,  this might be fun,, I suck at it, I pretty much suck at Ukulele playing too but manage to play rock tunes that actually sound like something..I might some day figure out how to tune it like a ukulele but you can play songs with three to four chords,  good luck."
37,319,4.0,"The mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped. There was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke. I tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs.I removed the pick guard because I really didn't like how it looked and it looks fine without it. The strings that come with it work fine and none snapped. Even if you end up not wanting to play it, you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than I would have expected. The only problem I have is that the two G chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly. I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap. Also, another difficulty I had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on. If you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out."
254,647,4.0,"I'm a beginner ukulele player, and I bought one of the cheap ukulele's here on Amazon. It didn't sound very good, and I didn't know if it was the instrument or the strings. It was the strings, and I'm very glad I replaced them with these strings. They make my ukulele sound like it should, and it holds tuning pretty well. I'm very happy with the purchase."
591,647,3.0,"Don't panic, strings marked A/D/F#/B CAN be used just fine for G/C/E/A tuning... They don't seem to be quite as nice as the comparable Aquilas, but they're half the price... They were for a $20 uke... (And yeah, new $4 strings do improve the sound on a $20 uke!)."
1074,647,4.0,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
804,647,4.0,"These are great strings for such a ""rare"" instrument. Not many people play the baritone yuke - it has a unique quality to it, sort of like a miniature classical guitar. These strings sound full and warm on the instrument."
1387,647,4.0,Bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele (the originals only lasted a week).  These D'Addario's have worn quite well and still sound excellent.  Great strings!
103,647,4.0,"while learning how to read these things better,, I picked these up,  I need to read better becaseu I have 4 Ukuleles,. all different size and right now my tenor has a wound string on the third string,  so now I am more careful with buying strings, not that a wound is bad, I just suck at playing, my  concert is my favorite and just discovered that it fits in the case I bought for my soprano and I can take it on travel.."
548,647,4.0,So while I got this for my soprano ukulele... they fit fine. Not much to say really other then they are good strings and work.
1257,795,4.0,"I've tried a lot of strings and these are my favorites, although I use the heavier MLT 2036 strings sometimes.These ones bend easier. The heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less.Both last as well as the more expensive Ball and Gore (elixir), coated strings I have used.And I like the sound better."
1022,795,1.0,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them.  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
730,795,4.0,Best strings ever
788,795,4.0,Strung these up on a Seagull guitar to replace some strings that were several years old and the gauge and action of the guitar killed my fingers so it didn't get played much. These strings feel great and sound fantastic. Very bright defined highs and great rumbling lows.
640,795,4.0,"Nothing sounds as bright as these strings. I've tried many, and these are the best by far. I know, cause I play'em geetar real good-like."
1190,795,3.0,this strings are just for starters because they feel really light but sound too weird so if u want to buy a really good for pro please but martin
664,187,2.0,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as ""black"" as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more ""string squeak"" when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that ""vintage tone"" but they do sound decent.However, for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings, Super Light, 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me, but I am a Da-Dairy-O man, for now."
92,187,4.0,"What can I say that has not been said about the other DRs that I have used. They rock, roll, andbend with the greatest of ease; once broken in, of course. If you want a mellower, bluesier stringwith decent sustain try DR Pure Blues.I decided to use 9's on my Fender Tele hollow-body because the company puts 9s on their guitars.I didn't want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so I stuckwith the 9s. Hey, the Rev uses 7's; size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone.The other reason for the Pure Nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from P-90pick ups. Pure Nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit. One more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets; which is a good thing. Steel will wear down your frets a lot faster.I will say that my very first set of DR Pure Blues went bad after a few weeks. The windings brokeon the D-string at two places where the string fretted. The reason I kept going back to DR Bluesis that I have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars (4 solid bodies & another hollow-body) since then. Giving DR a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in 2010 was a fluke.If you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with DR Pure Blues.Allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone. This is because prior to the mid-40'smost strings were made of nickel. During WWII nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings. Or so the historical theory goes.Gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound. To achieve the ""vintage"" tone I am sure you would alsoneed the right amp AND the right touch to get to that point. I am not necessarily looking for a""vintage"" tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last. Your exact mileagemay differ.I have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers. The only time I get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board. There is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much I wipethe fret board. Definitely not the strings though. I have also never heard any string-squeak from thestrings that would give me pause either. Any string, even on acoustic, will squeak occasionally. Withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high, or the nut is not cut right, or the wrong sizestring is used for the nut.Well there you go; what I have experienced with DR Pure Blues Nickel Wrap Round Core strings. I willalso say that on guitar forums that I frequent more people are giving DR kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings. So if you do get a bum string give them a holler. Now get out thereand play your heart out. Oh and how about working on that ""vintage"" tone while you are at it.Have fun."
243,187,0.0,"I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret."
1304,187,4.0,"I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits, but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set, DR strings never disappoint."
500,582,4.0,"I put these in my Ibanez EW acoustic-electric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing, not to mention they look fantastic. They fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a q-tip to make sure they seated fully. Absolutely tickled with the look and performance. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
118,582,4.0,"I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it, I change strings and toss those white plastic pins.  Makes any guitar look so much classier!  I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too!  Phenominal value,  tons of bang for the buck  They look SOOOO good on there...  Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far."
357,582,4.0,"Adds a little sustain and they look sharp, but not gaudy, put them on my Martin D-35, Epiphone AJ 220SCE and Washburn Travel Series RO10TR ,,,, nice."
1165,582,3.0,These look great on my guitar. I was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didn't. I would recommend these they look great. The ones I got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture.
627,582,4.0,"I use these pins on some of my 3/4 size guitars. Not really sure if I can notice a difference in sound between these, plastic, or ebony pins that I have but they are attractive and certainly appear to be different."
1025,582,4.0,"I put these on my ""campfire acoustic"" Black Yamaha F335 and they look stunning. The tone seems slightly brighter, however, I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings. Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective ""sounds good"".These pins are a little thin (small) so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing. If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins. This may not be necessary, however, even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole. The string should go all the way through the hole, into the body of the guitar. Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches, if possible it should be listing toward the neck. Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly. Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this. Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin. Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin. The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own. Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole. If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you're trying to get your guitar in tune (typically ruining a brand new string in the process). If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body (correctly) or hanging on the pin (incorrectly). Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation.These fit my guitar snugly but not tightly, however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more (sometimes using two fingers' strength to bend that far). Overall I am quite pleased with these."
1352,582,3.0,"Impressed with this set, I installed them today and have been playing for a few hours. My wife thinks my guitar looks better now, and I agree. Im not sure if they are supposed to be flush, and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out. I think my guitars tone has improved a little too, but I also installed new strings. Qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins!"
1360,582,4.0,These pins are amazing. One u never have to worry about breaking them. They look really nice and they do add noticeable sustain. Very cool.
1326,614,3.0,It works really well and it's really thin. It's thinner than i thought. The price it's about right. I needed only 3 of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this.
13,614,4.0,compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board.  the quality is good. I like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again.  very handy for making it all just right.  I will buy these again for sure.
1269,614,4.0,"Hosa, has good cables. I use them between my guitar effects pedals and then a 5 footer from effects to the amp. Had them over two months a they work great."
681,614,4.0,"These are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price. I love the flat, low profile, right angle plugs. My only complaint is I needed some in varying lengths (like 15&#34;) and so I had to order the Planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard."
34,614,4.0,"I've never had a problem with these patch cables. I'm running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out.One thing that is important to note is that I'm not hard on my gear. I'm a home noodler, so I can't say if these patches can take road/stage abuse and lots of setup/tear-down cycles. They seem pretty buff and capable, but I can only report what I've experienced."
759,614,2.0,"all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily. so I switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearsHosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable, 6 Packand they are still going strong."
804,614,4.0,"I use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space. They work well and I haven't had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises. I highly recommend them. Plus, they look nice, unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier, cheaper 1' cords."
454,614,3.0,"These are thin. They allow getting your pedals very close to each other, and let you optimize your pedal board space. I had other cables on my pedal boards. I replaced everything with those."
116,614,4.0,"I love these patch cables.  They can be serviced if need be, but mine have never needed it.  I've ordered about 3 batches of these guys and I would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex.  The length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected, and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes.  However there are many cables of much lesser value, which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown."
1268,614,4.0,"Simple. Solid. Compact. Convenient. Audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables. For the money, you can't beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit."
994,614,3.0,"Once you setup your pedalboard... that's it, you aren't going to move, stretch, or step on these cables...so the fact that they are lighter weight is really not an issue.  They do however allow you to make the most use of the space on yourpedalboard... packing your pedals side by side without staggering like larger heavier cables require."
320,614,3.0,"Just be aware that the ends are so big that some vertical input boxes, like my Danelectro Fish and Chips, can't be used with these cables because the input and output are too close together."
1297,614,4.0,"I've had it for almost 3 years now.. not a single problem! I've changed my setup like crazy, sometimes even the cables had to be twisted in some certain position on a pedalboard. Been bent on the edge of the cable right before the connector, been pulled (normal way) and stomped, never a single cut offs on the connection.Don't worry too much about cables like a sissy bedroom princess guitarists, you're using od/distortion pedals anyway right? If you're a purist, don't ever use a pedals or even electric guitar. Good luck!"
174,614,4.0,"They have good ends, they do feel a little flimsy on the cord side of things. They have good signal though and don't seem to alter the tone. I have them all on my pedalboard now so time will tell if they hold up or not."
703,751,4.0,"Hands down, in my opinion these are by far the best guitar straps you can get. I have a few of planet waves different designs for these, all on my electrics. I have an acoustic-electric Ibanez but the strap wouldn't fit, however the strap wasn't purchased for the acoustic - I was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sake.If you're considering buying this, just do it."
1221,751,1.0,"I bought one of these in the beginning - just to have something - as this is better than having nothing at all - but it's certainly nothing special. The material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain, so I only used it for a very short time.On the other hand, if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of, then you'll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point. I upgraded to a really nice 3&#34; wide black leather Levy's guitar strap - which is five stars all the way.If you're a newbie and don't have a strap, and are on a tight budget and need something, then this Planet waves strap will probably work for you - till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear. Just my 2 cents."
98,751,3.0,"I typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars. they work very well for my needs.  however, I bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i don't care what happens to the gear.  This strap is perfect for those needs. A nice nylon and the lock works wellBUTthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons. It works on the bass i use it on, but not my Gibson SG, so be aware. I would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap."
991,751,3.0,I like this almost as well as the Ernie Ball alternative I've been using for 20+ years with Shaler strap locks.These work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently. You may or may not love the details but they work just fine and to me are extremely comfortable.
1350,751,4.0,"I only recently started playing the guitar, and as a beginner, I wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitar.This one came at a great price and it's sturdy enough for me, so I think this is very decent strap for the price I paid for it.  It's quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily."
903,751,4.0,This strap replaces another one just like it which I use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons.  For stage I like something heavier.  Good quality.  The holes work with my strap buttons okay.  My lower button is an output jack for an after-market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button.  But this strap works okay with it.  It just takes a little more force to get it on which I'm sure will go away over time with use.  Great price for a simple strap at around $5.
458,751,4.0,"I bought this during the Black Friday sale. The price was right, since if I was dissatisfied then I wouldn't be out that much money.Quality product. Well worth the purchase. I would recommend this."
1174,751,3.0,"Material is similar to my messenger bag's strap. Reasonably comfortable, but I don't want it cutting into my neck. Does not go short enough for one of my smaller ukes, a rubber band or spare capo is enough to fix that."
160,751,2.0,I got two of these but wish I had got better ones. Using them on the Black thinline and the Washburn classical.
140,751,4.0,Bought this for one of my cheaper guitars and it does the job.  It adjusts easily and doesn't look bad either
113,751,4.0,"My experience with these straps has been great.  The polyester material is sturdy and comfortable, the leather post binding is sturdy and easy to use.  The straps have PET/ABS buckles and are easily adjusted.  I've not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking.Note: It is possible that this material can become brittle if stored in high heat (a car trunk or in sunlight within a hot car), but that problem isn't a manufacturing defect so much as a material deficit.For the price, the functionality is excellent.  If you are looking for a product for an everyday use guitar, with little investment or maintenance, this is it."
570,751,4.0,I have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware. I think it looks great and I wish I could upload pictures!
586,751,4.0,"very comfortable, lightweight, strong. Good stitching, leather ends and adjustable for short or tall. Affordable and comes in many colors."
1225,751,4.0,"Works perfectly for me, it does got a nice made.Plus nothing could beat its price, so, get it!"
1213,751,1.0,I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap. Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play. If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made.
1379,751,3.0,"i like this very much,because i can't love a polypropylene guitar strap,,,if you have a neck and a guitar,then you are in business!!! (you really can't ask more than that from a strap) it feels fine,and if you have a bedazzler you can write your name on it...me, not so much,i'll just leave it hang!!!"
110,751,3.0,Bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap. Nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar.
1293,751,2.0,Kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but I only use it for walking around the house strumming when I am playing my secondary guitars.  It's fine for the price.
1160,751,3.0,"You know, I love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps.  I own one of these (in differing colors and textures) for eack of my guitars.  I no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while I'm playing.  That prevents a lot of damage."
452,751,4.0,This is a very very nice guitar strap.  Comes with dual locking strap holes on each end.  Very nice for creating a great grip on your guitar so they won't fall off.  I originally bought the cheaper version and sent it back and got this one.  Very good for the price.
399,751,0.0,"Based upon some of the other reviews, I feel I got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. I ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. Second, both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34;. Both mine measured 45&#34; from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-extended. They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on. I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. Very disappointed. Warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here."
1113,751,4.0,"I had been having lots of trouble with my guitars falling from the leather ended straps.  Not any more.  These locking ends are the ticket!  They are quick to release and adjust, and fit very well.  They are bulky when putting the guitar in a case, but I just leave them on.  The strap itself is plain, but it highlights the beauty of my guitar.  It's a must for any rambunctious guitar player."
189,751,3.0,"Pretty basic strap, but durable and works for me.  The only thing I noticed is I think that one of the end pieces was attached with the stitching on the wrong side, but it's just a picky detail."
1309,751,4.0,"This strap seemed a little awkward at first, but after a rigorous six month evaluation it's become my go-to strap.I currently have it locked to a Fender Strat and experience NO problems with the strap ends rubbing against the body of the guitar.  Although the strap ends are light plastic, they've held up well.  The nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear.  The nylon isn't that soft, so if you are that guy who insists on playing shirtless then this may not be the strap for you.It will lock to most standard strap ends, if the body of your guitar allows it.  I wasn't all that happy with this strap connected to a Les Paul."
182,751,2.0,"This strap is not a bad one, but it just did not fit my guitar, so that is the only problem. I have a classical guitar and sadly, this strap does not fit it."
119,751,4.0,"It won't slip. It won't miss. It won't a guitar break. You can count on Planet Waves' quality. I like it's simplicity and reliability. - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'"
1116,751,4.0,"It's a strap.  It's pretty well made.  It holds your guitar on your body so you can play it.  It costs $5 or less delivered...what more could you ask for in a strap???  There may be better ones out there, but at more $$ and this does the same thing."
151,751,3.0,"Spend a few more bucks and get a padded one. This one is comfortable for 10 mins then it's cramp time. Just save yourself the hassle, this one is too cheap to return and while it's ""OK"" it's not great for long-term playing."
1205,751,3.0,"These Planet Waves locking straps work very well on most guitars with standard-size strap pins.  Once locked, they're not going anywhere.  What you need to be careful about is that you have to use some common sense - the locking end, once fastened, can act as a lever to pull the pin out of the guitar if pressure is put on it a certain way.  For this reason, you would want to be careful when using it on acoustic, hollow, or semi-hollow guitars.  And I certainly wouldn't keep this strap on a guitar when it's going to be carried in a gig bag.  Keeping this in mind, these straps are an efficient, inexpensive way to be sure your guitar won't break loose of its strap."
169,751,4.0,"Good design, good price, smart locking mechanism, great for classic, accustic and light electric guitars"
1288,751,4.0,"this is a good product. its not the best strap but, for what i paid for it, its well worth it. ive had it for about a month and so far it seems to be holding up very well. this is a great product for a beginer."
8,751,2.0,I got an ernie ball strap instead of a planet waves strap
1039,751,4.0,This is a good quality strap!  It is wide and has leather ends.  It fits my Les Paul 100 just fine and I am sure it willlast a long time with normal use.Can't go wrong for the price!
64,751,4.0,"This is a Palnet Waves and just as good as the more expensive ones.Material is rougher,but that's a good thing."
1394,751,4.0,"Looks good.  Great quality for such a low price.  Fits the instrument, (and old Mexican acoustic), and feels comfortable.  They arrived before the promised delivery date."
548,751,4.0,Works well for my guitar. It holds where I left it over a year ago. I don't use it all that often though...
1053,751,3.0,"The threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin, but it's still a great strap and holds up solidly. Would certainly buy again."
542,467,4.0,"I bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build. This works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply. I would say it is just a bit bigger than a pedal. It was easy enough to connect all my pedals and run the cables. My board looks great, works well, and I love this power supply"
1388,467,3.0,"Sure it's a bit pricey, but I think having a top-notch power supply for your pedalboard is priceless. Just being able to do away with a power strip or two full of wall warts is amazing in itself. The fact thing this cuts down on floor noise AND conditions your power supply too? Sign me up. Pair this up with a Pedaltrain board, and you've got yourself a sweet setup."
71,467,4.0,"Great universal power supply for your pedals, and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome. I have two of these that I mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly. Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with, and you won't get any noise interference with its isolated outputs."
178,467,4.0,Come with all cables needed.Solid and very much worth the money im very happy with this purchase no regrets at all.
803,467,4.0,This power supply is great for me. I attached it underneath my Pedal train and it works great. The 2 knobs you see on it can &#34;Sag&#34; the power to be less voltage. You can get your pedal to sound as if it has a dying battery in it.
830,331,3.0,"I haven't used this yet, but it seems solid and idiot proof - just like I need. Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick. Very good price."
904,331,4.0,"It fits nice an tight on mic stand, you can get around ten picks in it, so it's a good product."
1137,331,4.0,"singing and playing menas you dont get to bend down and pick up that pick you just dropped. I loved this holder, its small enough to fit in your pocket and when you go on stage just throw it on the mic stand. loved it but i forgot it at a gig, thats the down side of it being so small, easy to lose, but it is awesome"
886,331,3.0,"I'm rating it 4 stars because although it is able to attach to most mic stands, it doesn't fit them all very well. Opening up for headliners, you basically get given most of your stage gear (minus your own instrument gear) so if you're given a mic stand that has a smaller diameter tube, this will not fit as nicely.  I was playing a couple shows and this thing would slowly slip down the pole (that's what she said).  Usually worked fine. I'll still recommend this wedgie."
280,331,4.0,Love the security of having my picks within grasp!  Great product and great value! I would highly recommend this to others.
1332,331,4.0,"Just exactly as stated, this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand. Holds 6 picks. It is exactly what I wanted for a great price. Thanks!Editing this review to say that today I got a few thin picks and the ""thin"" picks do not hold in this. Mediums do great but the thin fall right out. Fine for me because I will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone."
438,331,4.0,"How much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand???  First, it a great price - about the same as a Big Mac (LOL).  Second, it fits great & does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Third, now that I use a pick holder I wonder why I never did so before.I do have a tendency to break, drop or even wear-out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency.  I have some solid / heavier weighted stands that ""stand-up"" to a quick grab of a pick from this holder.  But when using one of my cheaper /lighter tripod-style stands I make sure I'm careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so I don't pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick.Great product - ""couldn't live without it"" (LOL), and it's NOT the manufacturer's fault I have some cheap light-weight stands....  If you're looking for a pick holder I can't think of any reason not to try this one."
413,331,4.0,"I'm not a performing musician, so I actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand.  Holds everything from a .5mm nylon pick to a 3.1mm rubber pick, and I have yet to see one fall out.  Simple solution to a simple problem."
387,331,4.0,Fits all standard mike stands.Stays where it is supposed to.The perfect accessory for the stage or studio.Will buy some more.
565,383,4.0,This mute allows me to practice without annoying my family and does not harm the violin. It seems well made.
612,383,0.0,"I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time."
1014,383,4.0,"cheap, easy to use, cuts sound 70%.  Ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment.  Works exactly as described.  If you want 90% sound reduction however you will need a metal mute.  This one works better than the smaller rubber ones."
885,383,4.0,"Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute is good tool for your violin. If you are afraid to disturb your neighbors, when you are practicing violin - just buy it. It will put the sound down. It really works."
1282,383,3.0,"I works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it.Notice the curve of the Mute and the curve of the top of the bridge.It only is supposed to go on one way, to match the shape of the bridge.Try reversing it and you'll see what I mean.Also, you have to press the mute down almost all the way to the top ofthe bridge, otherwise it won't mute the sound very much.If used correctly, this mute works well."
935,383,4.0,"I am 65 years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months.  As you can imagine, I need to practice a LOT!  My wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing...especially when I practice monotonous scales.I saw the Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor's web site.  I love it!  Easy to put on and take off. The rubber won't hurt your violin, bridge or strings. You can barely hear it in the next room.  You can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge.  My violin's tone doesn't change much at all with this mute.Now I can practice all I want without fear of my wife divorcing me!"
433,383,3.0,Nice to use to muse your violin. A must need to prevent from annoying people while your practicing. Great buy.
1252,383,4.0,Excellent!  Mother's Little Helper!  Highly recommend this item.  It a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument. A Must.
960,383,4.0,"it doesnt completely mute my violin but i suppose nothing really can, it does take the loud peircing noise out though"
9,383,3.0,"I can not evaluate the product until the instrument I purchased is repaired or returned.  Sorry,  I had rather not comment until it is used."
43,383,4.0,"Really perfect as advertised.  Experienced player might have other choices, but for me, it was easy to use and exactly met its purpose."
1121,383,0.0,"I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else. This item does not work and is a total waste of money. I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley& aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it!).I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way."
559,383,3.0,Takes the edge off the violin sound. I keep it on my office violin so I don't disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly.....
493,383,3.0,"I'm not sure how much I can say about a mute. It's easy to put on and take off, and it does its job. It mutes the violin to a reasonable level.  I used an SPL meter at a distance where a sustained open G string gave a reading of about +2db. With the mute, it dropped to -6db. I then tried a Yamaha silent electric violin (unplugged) and from the same distance, it barely registered. I recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about 1db, and the Yamaha read about -6db at that distance and setting.So it won't make your instrument completely silent, and from a purely subjective perspective, it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin, perhaps seeming about 10 to 20% louder had I not measured it.With accessories, tonal quality is typically important. But with a mute, you expect it to deteriorate. Surprisingly, there was still a lot of tone left, especially compared to the unplugged electric, yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced.You can't expect this to give great sound or complete silence, but it won't disturb the neighbors or their dogs, and it won't make the instrument sound dead. This is about 15 times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin, and the latter will probably sound worse. It's not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice."
40,432,3.0,"This pedal is solidly built, and works as advertised.  If you're using it strictly as a volume pedal, it does the job nicely.The only problem with it is when you use it as an expression pedal -- it has no polarity switch for expression output.Plugged into some gear as an expression pedal (my Digitech RP55, for example), the down position is muted and the up position is full volume (the opposite of where it should be), and wah effects are backwards as well.  There's no way to correct this without making your own crossover cable (which requires destroying a perfectly good patch cable)."
925,432,3.0,"I got this pedal recently.  All in all, it's a pretty nice device, expecially for the price.  Seems solid and well-made.  It has a nice big pedal for big feet.  It works smoothly.  I have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal.  My only gripe, is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal 9V battery, or a 12V plug in power supply.  Why the difference?  The really bad part (for me) is that I bought this to install in a newly-purchased Behringer pedal board, which comes with a 9V power supply.  So, in order for me to use this pedal in the board, I will have to run two different power supplies, or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard's power supply.  [Behringer...this was not thought out very well.]  I'm now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter, but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle.  Bottom line:  the pedal itself is great, but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you.One final note about Behringer...they seem to get bad marks now and then.  I really don't understand why.  I have two Behringer amps, two of their stomp boxes, the above-mentioned pedal board, and the volume pedal just discussed.  I really like all of them.  I have never had any problem with any of these items.  They perform well, are well made, and certainly, all came at a reasonable price.  Behringer's full range of products is so extensive, that I see little reason to buy any other brand.  I'm sticking with them."
1107,432,3.0,The pedal itself works perfectly fine. Using it as a foot pedal controller on my Korg Triton LE.IT SQUEAKS. Needs some WD-40 :)
1213,432,3.0,Great foot switch that is easy to use. I figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment. Wish they had put that in some instructions. If it's there I missed it.
453,432,2.0,"The power supply which is not included is a funky size, it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but I wouldn't recommend it only because it is not the proper size.  The guy that was using this was using it with a Fender Telecaster, and a single 12&#34; tube amp.  He found that the volume was cut by ~ 15-20% even with the pedal turned all the way up.  Any time a pedal allows for volume loss , it tends to effect tone & yes, Mr. Sound Engineer, &#34;tone&#34; is a real thing!The pedal is pretty bulky and won't fit well in most pedal boards, but it's not any more wide than the Morley, but it seems to be taller, longer, and heavier.I gave it 3 stars because, &#34;It's Okay&#34;, but it is far from great, and I would not buy this product again.  I understand the price is cheap, and if this is all you can afford, then go for it, but if you have the extra cheese, spread it."
702,432,3.0,"This is a good pedal overall, rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so I took the chance and I'm pleased. As some have said, the low range has quite a steep slope to it, uncomfortable foot angle. But it's a big pedal, and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so I can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth. I wish the TS jacks were top/bottom instead of side by side, seems it would take 1/4 right angle connectors better. One gets in the way of the other. Or even better if it were a TRS jack so you'd only need one input. I might modify it for that."
1387,432,3.0,"In our acoustic guitar band, I often play intros and solos heavily amped, but when the rest of the band members come in, my strumming overpowers the rest.  So I needed a way to throttle back to either nothing or slightly amplified in between intros and solos then apply full power as needed.  This volume control foot pedal works exactly as described.  Also, I had an extra 12 volt Netgear router wall wart that saves battery life during practice (I use the battery during gigs).  Despite some comments I've seen, the battery is extremely easy to change - no problem at all!  The device does reduce some of the signal going to my amp; hence only 4 stars."
1289,432,3.0,Used this foot pedal for a and so far I've had know problems. Replaced the battery only once. Good product for a inexpensive foot pedal.
1176,432,3.0,"I was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here, however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal. I only wanted this so that I could pair it with my RE-20 to control the intensity, and in that aspect, I can confirm that it works/pairs flawlessly. My only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive. For example; I tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a VST synthesizer, and it was recognized and mapped without issue, but rocking the pedal ever-so-slightly would cause erratic movement on the filter. This is the same behavior that I have when connected to the RE-20, in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that's anything but gradual. It's not the end of the world, but I was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise."
827,432,0.0,"I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2. When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal. As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany).It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.Also, you may say ""who cares if it squeaks a little""? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!Good luck if you buy it."
961,531,4.0,Bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot. Great quality for the money and works well. Mic is as described.
830,531,4.0,"I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop. I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58. While I did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - I DID have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too. One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey. These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response. The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2. Can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment. I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks. Great value & highly recommended."
166,531,4.0,this is the best mic for its quality and its price. perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable.i will buy another one of this.
546,531,4.0,I like this mic very much. It sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made. I do not use it in a professional capacity though but it certainly seems well enough made to stand up to plenty of use.
1243,531,3.0,"Excellent mic, rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise.Does not have an on/off switch which is a bit disappointing."
315,531,4.0,love is a perfect microphone for karaoke and mobile DJ live use it to provide live entertainment and I love your reception is perfect and not recommend it
111,531,3.0,"First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made.  But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  You can pay more and get less."
381,531,4.0,"Bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on YouTube. Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface. my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd. So it was something that was necessary. and not waste of money or an unwanted item. Also i don't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends, so now i can listen through my speakers."
19,531,4.0,"Nice mic - good quality, no problems and have used this heavy over the past year.  Sounds identical to my Shure SM58, but MUCH less."
470,531,4.0,I bought this to use in Children's Church.  Works great.  Has a nice sound.  Well made.  It has held up with all the kids using it.  Great value for the price.
1179,531,4.0,"Works great especially for the price. Just put a little more highs and mids when you eq it, and its pretty close to the sm58."
1314,531,3.0,"Good microphone for the money, sounds a little better than my AKG D88S, knocked it down to 4 stars due to the fact it does not have an on/off switch. I am a user of Behringer products though, own 2 of their amps."
1249,531,4.0,"This is a great quality microphone and at a good price. Keep it mind it is XLR, for those that haven't noticed. XLR is a better quality than other connections. It's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone (Looking for a good comparison.), and is MUCH better quality. It's flawless in quality and doesn't give any feedback. I would recomment for anyone, especially having such a great price."
776,531,1.0,"I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week. I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!). And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine.I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me.Here is the BUT ...... : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off.But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first.The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.And all seller seems to have trouble to say ""this product does not have this, does not have that..."" It only says what the product does have.Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch.I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone."
739,531,4.0,"wow wow I can't believe it working wonderful.I'm using it karaoke online in paltalk.I did compairation with somes I have, it's perfect vocal.I connected it with mixer Alesis 8 input.I wish it's built with switch on/offRecomend to buyer. Thanks Amazon"
123,531,4.0,"I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58. I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products. Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!"
911,531,4.0,"I was expecting a so-so mike for the price, boy was I surprised!  This mike is great.  One thing I did notice was that if it wasn't fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing, other than that it works great."
817,531,4.0,"This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work.I would not use this mic for professional singing, just spoken word.I have many microphones, and this compares to the $50. range mics."
141,531,4.0,"I originally was planning on purchasing 2- 3 packs of xm1800s, but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainer.I was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song.I really wanted Sure SM58&#8217;s, but the budget did not allow it.I normally stay away from Behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc., but these microphones were a game changer for me.They have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives, also an excellent output level to the mixer.I was able to EQ them easily for both male and female vocal ranges. I was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors.I was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end.I do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now."
833,531,4.0,"This is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the Shure SM58 but doesn't want to lay out $100. I bought it myself as a kind of experiment. I'm learning blues harp. I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing. For this reason, the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand. While my Astatic JT-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, I can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals.The spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands. The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand. And the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss).The mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies. Here are a couple of more casual notes:1. The mike in the picture looked bluish to me. What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish.2. The product description seems to report a weight of 8.5 ounces. I measured this mike at 10.3 ounces. That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that I've used.3. The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 Hz. Bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike.4. The mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its  only real deficiency. These switches really are very handy.5. In actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss.6. The mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection. I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.I hope this helps."
1250,531,4.0,This is a great microphone.  It fits easily into all the recording equipment I'm using.  It has some heft to it so I know it's not going to fall apart and be some wimpy microphone.  It gives me great sounds.
600,317,4.0,I was messing around with the wiring in a MIM strat and I ended up melting the switch. So I ordered this one to replace it. Worked out perfect.
350,317,4.0,Working great on my Stratocaster. Excellent purchase. Feels good to switch positions solid and quiet. I should've bought this to replace the original switch from the start.
1191,317,4.0,"Perfect OEM.  ONE WORD OF WARNING, if you are not good at soldering and/or you don't have a good iron, don't try this yourself.  The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry.  I recomend readingThe Fender Stratocaster Handbook: How To Buy, Maintain, Set Up, Troubleshoot, and Modify Your Stratif you are unsure."
260,317,2.0,I've wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently. Don't know if their QC has gone downhill or what. I didn't send them back because they're usually around $10 but it's disconcerting when a Fender product unexpectedly fails. It would have 5 stars but for the recent failures.
1157,317,4.0,"First of all, a little Amazon 101 - review the PRODUCT, not the service or the vendor.  Giving out 1-star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party (like Fender) didn't get you the right model is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with the product itself.  All you do is create the impression that this is a poorly-designed product, when exactly the opposite is the case.I have a Fender 5-way in my loaded pickguard as part of a Squier upgrade.  Beware that traditional Strats are 1 3/4"" thick, where as many Bullets and Affinity Strats are slightly less than that.  As such, you might have the bottom of this switch hitting the inside of the guitar.  You might need to either live with this or shave/sand out a portion of the interior if that's the case.But the switch itself works great and, really, is quite inexpensive relative to its importance!"
221,311,4.0,"It would be improper for me to claim that these FIT Stratocasters, because I have a Stratocaster remake and I drilled new holes for a Stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in. What I can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn't seem cheapo (surprised it didn't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag) the size of the screws was right, the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick, and it came with more than enough to install a Stratocaster pickguard. I'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways."
1292,311,4.0,"These screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body. They are good quality screws."
350,311,4.0,I have replaced my old tarnished screws with these. They fit great and plenty of screws. I am going to replace all my old screws with these.
372,311,4.0,"Fender guitars are made for tinkering -- they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws. At any given time I have a Fender guitar taken apart, and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws I inevitably lose. Don't get me wrong -- I am a die-hard Fenderista, but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects, not fine examples of the luthier's art. That's what makes them so much fun to play and modify."
140,311,4.0,"I bought these because I am constantly loosing screws when I change pickguards or do new builds.These are exactly what the doctor ordered.  Original equipment so they're the right screws,  A must have for every guitarist, no matter what brand you own as they work on everything.These are well made and don't strip when screwing in for the first time.  If it's a new project, always drill pilot holes anyway.  I am so glad I bought these, one by one they are being used...almost time to order another set.I store them in a little sandwich bag.  5 stars"
1191,311,4.0,"They have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better, and they give u some spares."
977,311,4.0,"these Fender pickguard screws are excellent, they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment, I replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they're much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent"
340,311,0.0,"Pretty disappointed in the color. As the review title indicates, what I received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for. Perhaps they would blend in better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result. Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. Some are very dull looking. Very disappointing, really."
1219,311,4.0,"OK, so they are just screws....... but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one!!!  And it is fender licensed!"
769,311,4.0,"These are the original, perfect fit on my american deluxe strat, so durable I got them for a while and they are still brilliant and making my guitar looking beautiful :D good stuff!"
180,311,3.0,"You get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your Stratocaster, however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard. Other than the two missing screws, this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your Stratocaster."
651,311,3.0,They work no issues handy to have on hand. Dont know what else to say they are screws they fasten thongs in place
1199,311,4.0,"Old screws rust, and often when presented with a new pick guard there are 11 instead of 8 holes for attachment. This package neatly solved the easthetic and necessary matching finish of the guitar. Also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms."
813,311,4.0,"I guess they are just screws, but they seem to be good quality.  Worth a little extra for the Fender quality I suppose."
155,311,4.0,What can I say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place. they fit in the factory hole without a problem. nothing fancy they just work.
694,311,4.0,"What can I say? Fits perfectly for a pickguard on a Fender style guitar. You could probably find them at a  cheap hardware store, but I was too lazy to go looking."
660,311,3.0,"Normal pickguard screws, nothing special here. You do get a nice amount for the money, though, so this is still a good, if not great, deal. Good to buy for stocking up with, just don't expect anything special because of the Fender name."
321,311,3.0,Pickguard screws. The screws are not very tough and you have to be gentle with them so that the screwdriver doesn't bugger up the heads. They are not high enough quality that they can be put in and taken out more than a couple of times before they become worn.
74,311,4.0,"These screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older Epiphone by Gibson S-900 that I opted to add a pick guard too, the screws fit everything perfectly. The look of the screws was even better than the cheap one you find on most import and low end made guitars the have the fat heads and strip really easy. I will purchase again for my next build."
630,311,4.0,Replacing your pickguard?  Lost a screw?  Authentic replacement screws if you need them.  I ordered these with a new pickguard for my Strat in case I lost or boogered up one of the screws.  Exactly like stock screws.
753,311,4.0,"They are and look the right size and fit the cover well, a must when you want the right screw for the job thanks"
361,311,4.0,"Finishing a build for a customer, without these, would have been a real problem.  Also used these for the tremolo back cover.  Very handy.  And no digging the the parts bin for screws."
1145,311,4.0,"Screws, just the right size. Shipped free as an add on item, at the time. No brains er...what else?"
639,311,0.0,I can't believe these were actually sent to me. The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China. I am sending them back. There is no way I would use these. Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive. I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.
671,311,4.0,Came with more screws than i needed. They were the right size. No issues. Thanks. You shouldnt be disappointed with this item.
600,514,4.0,I used this to replace a Pot in my MIM Telecaster. Works great. I didn't notice any change in tone. It just worked like the old one. But the main this is that it worked. And my Tele sounds as great as it always did.
536,514,3.0,"Comes with a capacitor, so that's a bonus.  These pots are CTS and have a nice tight feel compared to Alpha pots.  Alpha are a little cheaper, have basically the same tolerance, are slightly looser in feel as you turn, and get the job done pretty much the same.  What it really boils down to is whether you prefer a slightly tighter feel, or a slightly looser turning knob."
350,514,4.0,Perfect for my guitars. Sounds great for my telecaster and my Stratocaster guitars. Capacitor are a nice generalized  choice. Excellent choice.
1191,514,1.0,"I was a little disappointed.  Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k).  1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%.  They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused.  Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob).  I will be upgrading the caps."
957,514,4.0,"Hi, I thought these pots would come without the proper caps, it`s not on the description of the product, and they did, so I'm pleased by it, have not installed them yet... they are CTS brand, it`s hard to read what uF are the caps, I think they are 0.022uF the standard for Fender guitars"
260,514,4.0,"I've never had one of these pots fail on me. Never had one go scratchy. I'm sure they will, as most pots will, but I've either been fortunate or these are very well made pots."
956,514,3.0,"Ordered 6, and out of 6, I have exactly zero flat washers. Doesn't match the picture. Caps are marked 223K, so, looking that up, they are 0.022uf. Pot, lockwasher, nut, and cap are what is included."
790,514,4.0,Al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto.. y con una buen duravilidad.. hoy lo instalare.. Saludos desde Venezuela!!
593,514,3.0,"These were purchased for my parts bin.  They fit, they work, they are quiet and they won't make your life miserable.  That's all I want from replacment parts."
460,514,4.0,"Used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older Strat-type guitar, and it sounds great!  The diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original, Chinese pot, so I needed a cheap reamer (purchased through Amazon) to enlarge the pickguard hole.  It's a nice, smooth pot with no scratchiness.  nice big lugs to solder to."
190,514,4.0,"Good upgrade for my Squier Deluxe Strat. Although, note that if your pickguard isn't a Fender made brand, the hole in the pickguard maybe a little small. Not to worry. All I did was took a drill bit the same size as the &#34;screw&#34; (where the knob goes on, and drilled the pickguard, thus it fitting. Over all nice purchase."
669,604,4.0,"I picked this up because I wanted to change up the looks of my 3-tone sunburst American Standard. The holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install but that's what you'd expect since this is a genuine Fender part. The only concern really is whether or not the color will work on your guitar. At first, it took some getting used to as it really darkened up the look of my Strat but I like the way it came out with aged white pick up covers and knobs."
1301,604,1.0,"I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. Nice quality though."
1057,604,4.0,"Genuine fender pick guard.  It's pre-shielded.  Perfect for your next build, or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart."
1308,604,4.0,"It fit my American Vintage 70's Strat.  My guitar had an 11-hole pickguard.  I ordered an 11-hole pickguard and it fit like a glove.The guitar is 3-ply plastic, black/white/black.  This is what most black Fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like.I am happy with the purchase."
1064,604,4.0,"I have a Candy apple red Squier Surf Statocaster.  Came wiht a whited pearl pickgaurd.  Switch it for this Black one.  Looks great, really classes it up in my opinion.  I also got black knobs as well.  fits my axe perfectly"
145,604,4.0,Fit my 07 MIM strat perfectly.  Looks like a whole new guitar now.  If you have a Fender guitar then suck it up and buy only fender parts for it.  The Cheap china copies on ebay dont fit.
83,604,4.0,"I put this pickguard in a MIM White Blonde Stratocaster, and guitar looks so great. I didn't need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar."
140,575,4.0,"I needed a Jack Plate for my custom Stratocaster build and ordered this one.  It was far better than I expected.  It is very heavy duty, great chrome plating.  Not at all what I expected for the money.  A definite quality part worthy of this project that will be with me for life.  Nothing but the best going on this guitar, including this plate."
1191,575,4.0,Was upgrading the chrome on an MIM. Perfect fit.  Used Switchcraft jack.  Includes screws and 1 washer(for the jack).  Looks great.
1199,575,4.0,"Spipped and received on time,It fits, it works, it is heavier guage than most replacements. happy with it - like it."
813,575,4.0,Fender quality is just a step above the competition and worth the extra money over cheaper generic products.  Worked perfectly for my latest guitar project.
361,575,4.0,"Not much to screw up.  Good quality parts, on an essential product.  Brain-dead simple install. And no surprises; works like a champ!"
639,575,3.0,"Wow, I'm shocked. A Fender aftermarket product that didn't come with some sort of defect or problem. Amazing. Whomever does QC for this part should take over the the complete aftermarket parts division and replace the guys that do QC for the other parts I've purchased."
671,575,4.0,Not a lot of moving parts on this piece. LOL Its a simple piece to attach to your strat body.
1135,840,3.0,"This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth."
170,840,4.0,i love waxing my guitars..keep em protected...these stay in every case i own...works well to keep finger prints off...should make a couple of different sizes...but these for the price work fine...enjoy
805,840,4.0,"Item arrived as described and on time - Way larger than expected, but my son loved it!  Says it's easier to use than the smaller cloths we've gotten before."
292,840,4.0,use the cloth often to polish my guitar. The fender logo makes it look legit.  Recommended to one and all.
698,840,4.0,This cloth is perfect for wiping your guitar down after a playing session. A guitar is an investment and you should protect it. A good polish cloth is a must.
766,98,1.0,"Buttons itself are fine, however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). And I even pre-drill it. there is no way I can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now)"
867,98,2.0,"A bit wimpy, but so far they are holding up."
813,98,4.0,This was exactly what I needed and worked out great.  It would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons.  I had to pay another dollar at my local guitar shop for the felt padded washers.
1103,98,4.0,I ordered these strap buttons to upgrade some of my existing buttons.  I have recently purchased these beautiful guitar straps and needed new buttons.  These were filler items for a much larger purachse.  Thanks.
753,98,4.0,"They work nice on the guitar, make sure you use glue on the on the wood screw when installing it .This will help it to stay in the wood and not back out ."
124,98,4.0,"Not an exciting item, I'll admit, but they work as advertised and I do love having strap buttons on my instruments."
671,98,4.0,"What to say about this except that they mounted properly, came with the right screws and I didnt have any issues. LOL"
221,56,4.0,"These knobs arrived in perfect condition, the correct color and fit my Stratocaster remake well. You can't necessarily go wrong with knobs. I like the black look to my guitar now."
1003,56,0.0,"Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.Will try other brands next time."
560,56,4.0,I needed good knobs! I enjoy them! I highly recommend them! They will last for a long time and they are a good product!
1199,56,4.0,"These are perfect, but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed I would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package. I have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don't match, they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced"
155,56,4.0,"bought these for my Squire Strat. I was changing the look with new pickgaurd, nobs and switch tips.  these nobs fit great and look great. I would difenantly recomend them"
598,56,3.0,"Well, unless you absolutely botch production, it's hard to go wrong with some guitar knobs. Typical plastic, durable, and looks good."
361,56,4.0,"I have an abundance of strat parts.  So when a vintage non-strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench, I plunked these on the pots.  The customer liked them so much, he kept them on.  Now what to do with these other knobs?"
1392,143,2.0,"Back plate has a ""greenish"" tint, and is single ply, not 3-ply as advertised.Color wasnt as advertised, its more of an ""off-white"" than a vintage cream. But I guess its close enough considering the price.Shipping took far too long. (Not sure if Music123 or USPS is to blame for that, but Id go with USPS)Besides those minor faults, the items fit well and look good.My 2006 Strat now has the look of a '57, without the huge price tag."
669,143,4.0,"One of the my favorite thigns about Strats is how easy they are to modify/customize. After about 10 years with my American Standard, I was itching to change up the look so I changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers. I didn't need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts I wanted seperately. The back plate is a single-ply, mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories, this will give you a matching back plate. You can never go wrong with real Fender parts."
603,143,4.0,"This is the 2nd set of these Fender parts I've ordered. $15,delivered is about the cheapest price,anywhere. They look great and fit perfectly. Can't go wrong."
541,143,4.0,"The product arrived as in the description, but I made the mistake to buy it for my Fender Squier Bullet (not a ""full"" Strat).There are 2 differences between this pickup covers and my Fender Squier: First, the magnet tips in the Squier are closer together.  I guess the fretboard is narrower than the Strats. Second, the Squier's has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup.My solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent. Not the most beautiful thing but worked.The other parts (knob, backplate and tips) fit perfectly."
1308,143,4.0,I like replacing the pickguard and other plastic parts to give my guitars a different look.  It takes under $40 (accessory kit + pickguard) to give your guitar a make over.Money well spent.
889,143,4.0,"FYI - Parchment is slightly off white. . . unless you're comparing right next to a pure white pickguard, you probably would think they're simply white."
718,143,2.0,I was happy it was made in the USA but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs. Might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn't done by shipping.
361,143,4.0,"Recieved the accessory kit, only to find I was missing the black tip for the five-way switch and tremolo bar tip.  Trem back cover fit nicely and the knobs help me complete a few other project.  Saving the p/u covers for my next project, but it would be nice to get the trem tip and switch tip sent to me.Great customer service.  Received missing parts, immediately.  Finished the project.  I definitely will be using this seller again.  Thanks"
639,143,0.0,"Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost."
707,143,4.0,"I got the aged white. I was changing out pups for a more vintage sound. This kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one. I have a MIM 2012 Strat, every thing went together with out any issues. Best price online and the shipping was super fast. I back plate is the mint green, but looks awesome on the guitar."
83,143,4.0,"I have a Fender Stratocaster MIM with standard white pickguard, which I changed by a black one. Then I decided also change others white pieces, and this Fender Accessory Kit fit perfect in my guitar. I didn't need no adaptation to install it on guitar."
671,143,3.0,"But didnt work on the el cheapo drop in pickguard/pickup setup that I got here on Amazon. Other than that, they look cool in the package. LOLI suppose this gives me a reason to build a whole other guitar just to use these covers. ahahahahahahYeah, thats right...."
144,882,3.0,"Kudos to Fender for making an amp like this available at this price point.  It has 25 watts of power, a 10 inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor.  It will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it's supposed to.The downside is that when I compare this amp to what Fender was selling fifteen years ago, the Champion 110, it falls a little short.  The particle board cabinet is thinner, the speaker is less hefty, and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial.  It's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is, and they also moved production to Indonesia from Mexico.  Maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean.All the same, I can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10"" speaker and real Fender tone and looks.  Fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but I kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp."
131,882,4.0,"i got mine yesterday and love it, it sounds grate ,i didn't know what amp to get, i looked and looked ,read a lot of reviews and even got on YouTube to see what people had to say, and seems this one had a lot of good reviews,, i knew fender has a good name for amps , and for the money this one was the one, i am so glad i got it , it gave life to my electric guitar, i bought mine somewhere else ,but still grate amp ,,i didn't want to spend a lot of money for an amp ,and didn't want to get something small  for 20 or 30 dollars less and would out grow with my music,as i get better playing guitar, but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will. this will save me money in the long-run ,i am very happy with it,i like the five year warranty that came with it, you can't go wrong ,great sound,, and its not to big ,,nice size amp,,and  easy to pick-up,,nice looking amp ,,"
937,882,4.0,"I was buying a pawn shop guitar, when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar. I didn't expect to actually use it but what the heck, I could sell it and make a bit of money back. Got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the Frontman 25 just to see if it worked. I was surprised to find out not only did it work, it sounded very good. I own a Deluxe Reverb all tube amp and the little Frontman 25 had the Fender sound. What really was impressive was the reverb, it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound. I actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well, I normally use a Blues Jr for small gigs but the Frontman did a fine job. On some smaller gigs when all I need is a little reverb I just plug straight into the amp and it worked well, plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it's small and easy on the back. All in all very impressed and have decided to keep it. I would easily pay full retail, it is a nice little amp, might even see if I can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it!"
35,882,4.0,"I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole. I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove. I love the tone and the reverb for $100 is amazing! The dirty channe is what it is, but the clean channel is worth the price of admission.I can imagine using this guy for a small gig, but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping. If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further, this really is a great little amp!**Update**If you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp, check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website![...]"
777,882,4.0,"I actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for $60, but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new, with no complaints. For such a small combo, this amp really packs a punch. It is plenty loud, and is just fine for smaller club gigs. However, you could use it in larger venues also, since you generally mic up your amp anyway, and get most of your sound from monitors.Anyway, the clean channel is what you would expect from any Fender amp, with good tone and crisp reverb. The high gain channel is really fat sounding. I still use distortion pedals, and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease (not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp, since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one), but without a pedal, the high gain channel performs adequately.For the price, this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion. Kind of does away with the need for a half stack, unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors. Plus, it is far lighter and easier to transport, lol."
134,882,4.0,"I am very pleased with my Frontman 25R. I purchased as a practice amp. The sound quality is very clear, and it has all the volume you will ever need. With the gain and drive cranked up to 10, I set the volume at 3. That is all the volume I need for practicing in my home. You could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10. I cranked it up to test it, and the sound quality was still clear at 10. I would recommend it as a good economical all around amp."
1201,882,4.0,"You get a 10"" speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp; try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around $90.00!!!!!!!!!!!!This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I owna butt load of new amps.I have actually upgraded to a Champion 40, but still use this amp as much as the 40.Don't even think about it, this is one of the best (under $100.00) practice amps, unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp, and in that case you should look elsewhere, as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time.As an addendum, I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras I have read from other reviewers. I have a few of these amps, so just for the heck of it,I put in a Celestion G10 Greenback (which costs more than the 25R) and was very disappointed withthe results.This amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now, but can still be had new for under $100.00 if you just do an internet search."
190,882,2.0,"I purchased this for my love of playing guitar. I like blues style and classic rock. This 25 watt amp will get the job done. It is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means. After a few months of playing the bass knob just blew. So I had no bass control. Arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging. You just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want. Took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings.This amp is rated 75 watts, so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt (into 8 ohm). I would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or Jensen. I'd recommend it, but don't buy it if your looking for a really decent tone. It's just a practice amp."
249,51,4.0,"Solid construction and well weighted, this stand is perfect for desktop use with height adjustments from 8.5"" to 13"" and a 6"" base; per the measurements given on the box.  The locking die-cast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure.  The color is darker than pictured on Amazon - black powder coating.  There's no tipping or imbalance to worry about with this mic stand, and it's reasonably priced. (* I picked mine up for under ten in the Amazon Warehouse.  It didn't ship with any directions for set-up, which may or may not be the standard packaging.)Do take note that this stand has a US standard 5/8"" top.  I needed a 5/8"" female to 3/8"" male adapter to get my mic to mount to this stand. There are a few on Amazon, but I found the best deal at another retailer online.  These are the adapters that I'm talking about:Windtech Adapter 5/8"" Female Standard Microphone to 3/8"" Male.  You may not need one if your microphone mount ships with one installed, which can be easily screwed out to then expose the 5/8"" space.Overall, I'm very pleased with the fit, finish and construction of this item, and I'm sure it will work very well for my uses. I recommend it to others looking for a stable, sturdy, adjustable desktop microphone stand."
1347,51,4.0,Great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic.Great Price! Very Happy and shipped from Amazon perfectly with great packing.
691,51,4.0,"When I found that my USB microphone cannot stand on the tripod that came with it, I was so glad that I bought this stand along with the mic based on all the positive reviews. This stand is basically dead weight. That's exactly what I wanted from a desk stand."
932,51,4.0,I bought 5 of these for live recording of my band. They adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding. I recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage. Features: Stable base; good extension; easy hand grip to lock/unlock for adjusting. For me it was a good perchase.
829,51,3.0,at2020 sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic.  would need a heavier base for use with a boom.
791,51,4.0,"If you're looking for a really durable stand, this is a good one for the desk. It just inconvenient that Amazon does list the product detail on the size of the screw head on top. Make sure your mic holder fits..."
888,51,3.0,Great for the desktop and vocals.  I have also used it successfully on the guitar cabinet.  It's an important component in my studio.
418,51,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what I was expecting. The adjustable stand also works great and won't fall on you or anything. I bought this and a mic/boom stand for my Samson SP01 Shockmount (which the Audio-Technica condenser mic is on), however its connecting slot is a 3/8in female while this stand has a 5/8in male (same with the mic/boom stand). So just make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect properly with the stand. If not, just buy a cheap (about 6$) adapter like I did."
417,51,4.0,Perfect for amp recordings and ambient mic. This helps my &#34;Apogee One&#34; to always be in perfect position and far from accidents and drops. Add &#34;Apogee One Mic Mount&#34;.
305,51,3.0,This is a great stand. The ability to adjust it and price point sold me on purchasing this unit. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a desk stand.
38,51,3.0,"This is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify foot-stomping percussion (traditional to French Canadian music).  The base is really heavy, which makes it stay in place well, but it's a pain to carry around.  Also, since buying this I found out that I could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet, which would have been a bit cheaper."
986,51,3.0,"I purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together.  It does, and it does it well.  Very solid build, never felt cheap in any way.  Perfect for its intended use.  I purchased a second one after using the first for one month.  Would buy again should the need arise."
939,51,4.0,This works great for mic'ing guitar amps. The stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp.
448,51,1.0,"My first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. It worked once when I originally set it, then kaput. It's never worked properly since. I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. I would not purchase this product again."
406,51,4.0,"I bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well. For only $12.00 it is a steal, the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy. I have used it with multiple mics such as the Audio Technica 2020 with the Samson SP01 shock-mount, a Rode K2, a Studio Projects C1 and a neumann TLM 103. I have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic. I was not going to write a review for this product but I came across another review that stated ""I purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a AT2020 with a SP01 shockmount. Mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what I try. "" THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. The Samson SP01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand ( as any shock-mount or mic would, since the threading is a standard size). I just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion. Also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount ( where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand) that is slightly smaller than most US mic stands, BUT THIS COMES OUT!! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A COIN AND UNSCREW IT FROM THE SHOCK-MOUNT. After the adapter is out the Samson SP01 will connect to this stand. I highly recommend this product."
540,51,4.0,I loved it very much. It is very sturdy and stable. It holds my shockmount with my Audio Technica AT2020 just perfectly and it does an amazing job.
507,51,3.0,Works for my Behringer XM1800S Mics. It came with a smaller thread adapter on it already. Idk what mics use that but is something to note.
1406,51,4.0,"Not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand. Solid heavy base. Well built. Does the job of holding a mic. No more, no less."
1142,51,3.0,"I bought this stand to mic a kick drum. It's too tall for lining the mic up with my port-- even at it's shortest setting. Still, it's well-constructed and would make a good desk-top mic mount. I like On Stage stuff. Good value, and good function."
1125,164,3.0,These worked fine. The mistake I made was buying them hastily. I needed nylon core strings..not steel. My mistake. I loaded them up anyway....sounded great.
97,164,3.0,"I've used several different kinds of strings over several years playing. I'm no expert, but these strings sound good to me.  Subtle differences with different styles of strings, so its a preference thing.  If you havent tried em, they're worth a shot."
954,164,4.0,"I started experimenting on strings, I say, why wouldn't I try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar? Awesome I like the brightness of sound it produced. I'm hooked to bronze strings. Thanks to Martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings!"
31,164,3.0,"I only needed one string, but it works fine.  These are good strings, but not 5 stars good.  And I have spares for later or to share."
1218,164,4.0,"Martin strings, just wish I could afford a Martin guitar. They last and they stay in tune. Sound very good too."
560,164,4.0,I enjoy this product and I definitely use them on my acoustic! They are good strings! Highly recommended! Enjoy them!
1204,164,2.0,"these are good. I dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range.  they all work well.  length of being brillant is somewhat limits, but it appears to be in most of these level of strings."
1303,164,3.0,These are excellent strings for the price and I will buy them again.  Martin is a name that means quality.
1304,164,4.0,"These strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned, I bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand. The owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup. I like the lighter sounds out of them, and using a capo makes them sound great also. These seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of Ernie Ball strings and I am planning on trying them out on another guitar soon.They seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well. I use them on an electric acoustic and I am happy with the sound when i play through an amp."
917,164,3.0,"Have not used the strings yet, I bought them as back up.  Have used this type of string before with satisfactory results, good tone, last a long time."
479,164,2.0,"For the price of these strings, you can't go wrong. However, compared to Elixers, the sound just isn't as &#34;full.&#34;"
220,164,3.0,"these strings are great for the price, they sound nice and are pretty long lasting but dont last or sound as nice as higher end strings but who cares when the strings are affordable. these strings are great for people are starting because its cheaper and its not a big deal when you break a lot of strings."
1421,164,3.0,The Martin M140 strings are good strings.  They play well and last reasonably well.  I change strings about every 2 to 4 months and play about an hour a day.  These strings lasted abotu 2 and a half months before they started to sound flat.  They did stay in tune well the whole time I had them on my guitar.  I had them on my Yamaha FG700S.
756,663,4.0,It was a great item. very nice strings. It looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar. Works great
717,663,3.0,"Great guitar strings, and affordable. I have used these for quite a while, and I have always liked them. Recently, I moved to Boston though, and here they seem to rust really quickly. They never used too. Its not that humid here, so I don't know if I got some bunk strings, or if the quality has gone down in the last year, or if really its the Boston weather. Historically, I have sworn by these though!!"
1326,663,3.0,"Good Strings, I buy this Strings from a few years and i love them, I like them with my Gibson LP, but also with my other guitar with the Floyd!, They are durable, and a really good sound for my Funky Rock Type of music i like!"
1401,663,4.0,I like Ernie Ball strings. They are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands I tried. I change strings every two weeks. I tried the rest and returned to the best.
156,663,4.0,"lovely strings  for rhythm guitarist, special i'm using it for reggae skanks rhythm and it sounds warm and scream... thanks"
1292,663,4.0,I purchased a 12 for the price of 10 pack of these from Musician's Friend. I've used Elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again. This 12 pack was about the same price as 2-3 packs of Elixirs. So far I am very happy with these strings. They sound and feel great.
565,663,4.0,"I've been using these strings for many years. They hold their tune for a long time and have a nice, rich on the low end, sparkly on  the high end tone. Quality has always been very consistent. I play classic rock, 90's alternative, modern country, blues, and 80's metal on Les Pauls, Strats, Teles, Rickenbackers, and Gretsch's. Live and in the studio, these strings work for everything."
1218,663,4.0,I always used another company's strings and avoided Ernie Ball strings. Now I don't know why. After using these I am very happy with the quality and tone I get from each set.
1021,663,4.0,This are some great strings. I have bought them my last 3 times and I will continue to buy them. I like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar. The tone is much bettter too.
140,663,4.0,"As cheap as these strings were, I am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved.I picked up an old, cheap electric guitar that needed some work.  It had been dropped on it's head.After repairing and playing it, it still sounded like crap so I had these strings, they were cheap and I put them on.  Only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort.Okay, the guitar (and I am too embarrassed to give the brand) isn't my Gibson Les Paul or my Fender American Strat, but damn, it sounds good now.  If I didn't have so many guitars, I might keep this one but I will probably sell it to make room for another.These were well worth the few dollars I spent on them.  Honestly, I won't restring my Fender with them, I'll use the Fender 250 bullets.  But these are great for about any electric.  With guitars, crappy strings kill it.  Great strings can make a bad guitar okay, not great.I will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars."
120,663,4.0,"Used the 9-42's for years but thought I would give these a try. Fuller sound with the 10-46's butI cannot bend them like the 9's. I have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety: 10's for rhythm and finger style, 9's for lead. Get the packs of single 9's and 10's too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set."
1204,663,4.0,"I have been using these strings for a while now.  they are consistent, sound good, have a good life, and are very well priced through Amazon.  They are crisp and vibrant when new and this lasts for quite a while.  I will continue to buy them by the dozen for my electric guitars."
148,663,4.0,"These are the standard in guitar strings - they are well made, play nicely and are the size that most guitars come with from the factory.Do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with? Are they hand-wound? Are they made with exotic materials? No to all the above. These are a high quality no-frills set that is acceptable to everyone from beginners to the most accomplished professional.These days they make everything from coated strings of various colors, to pure nickel to pure stainless steel in almost every mix and match gauge imaginable. If you aren't a beginning guitarist you probably aren't reading this review, because you've already played a set of these. You are off playing different brands and tech just to fine tune things, maybe trying out the latest coating or maybe just deciding that pure nickels have that vintage vibe you're going for.But if you just need to know if Ernie Ball strings are any good they are. The bigger question for beginners is do I keep the gauge that came on my instrument, (these for Gisbsons, Super Slinkys - pink package - for Fenders as a rule of thumb) or do I try something new.In summary, for me these are the safe pick, the strings that I know will work when I just need a good set of strings at a great price. You really can't go wrong with a set of these."
1172,663,4.0,"Oh man am i glad I found this deal, no more $8.00 for strings anymore, there the exact same as you would get from the store, delivered through USPS, dont have to go anywhere, how cool is that, 5 out of 5 Stars, but of course, its ERNIE BALL."
706,663,3.0,"These strings are good, especially for the price. I have found better strings through D'Addario however, and the feel of them is  superior to these in my opinion."
482,663,4.0,I started out wilth Balls when I first picked up the guitar in 1968 when I was 17. They were worth my part time minimum wage money and gave me what I wanted. A very reliable product that took me through the transition from an amateur to a professional lead guitarist. I highly recommend them. Keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag!
219,663,4.0,I have never been let down by Ernie Ball strings. They produce a bright clear sound and for every other string in their price range they are the best way to go. I only use them and I have been playing for a decade.They stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings.Whenever I buy a new guitar and change out the factory strings I am always shocked at how much better my instrument sounds.
366,663,3.0,"This is a pack of guitar strings.  It sounds good on my guitar and it's not that expensive.  I like it(4 star rating according to amazon).  I would rate it 5 stars(amazon rating for 5 stars is if you 'love' the product),if it made me sound like Clapton unfortunately, none of the gear that I bought can do this!  Also, I kind of find it hard to 'love' a pack of guitar strings."
539,663,0.0,"these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,"
1185,663,4.0,"Ernie Balls are nice strings, cheap, durable and produce a rich sound. I'm so proud of my Balls."
660,663,4.0,"I've been using Slinky's for so long now, I honestly don't see me using any other brand ever again. They are tough, well made, and simply work and sound great....do what everyone else does and try them out and see for yourself what a difference a great string makes to your playing!"
151,663,4.0,"These just sound great. Huge upgrade from the stock factory strings on our beginner Ibanez electric guitar. Good stuff, will certainly come back for more when the time comes. Cheap for what you get, and a nice sonic upgrade with a great feel."
529,663,4.0,"These are my favorite strings for electric guitar. I've been using them since I started playing about eighteen years ago. I've tried other strings, like Gibson and D'Addario, but I like the sound and feel of Ernie Balls the best -- they feel nice, full, thick, hefty. I play blues, jazz, and bluesy rock. I use these on a Gibson Les Paul Vintage Mahogany and a Yamaha neck-thru-body electric, and they are good for the music I play and for providing a full-bodied sound. There are a whole host of ""big name"" guitarists who use these strings, and for good reason. I buy them in 10 packs to save money -- can't seem to find that option here on Amazon."
178,663,4.0,the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic!
624,663,4.0,Slinky is used by tons of professionals because they work well and endure rough playing.These strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings.change yours now.
188,663,4.0,"i must re order soon because i broke one string yesterday, these are the best strings i've ever had i love them and may bands use them too"
1063,663,4.0,"Ernie Ball is the standard for guitar strings. I tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the GHS boomers and D'Addario. I have to say, I only had a pack of Slinky Strings during my last setup and I'm glad that's what I used because they play great and sound amazing."
915,663,4.0,I really like the mediums.  They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough.
190,663,4.0,"Great strings. Bends are easy. Stay in tune well. Shipping was fast and I'd definitely recommend these. John Mayer, and other of my favorite musicians use these strings, there great."
361,663,3.0,"I could never get the sound I wanted using other manufacturers strings.  I tried Ernie Ball Slinkys just for shiggles.  I was quite surprised at the quality of the tone I get from my guitars now.  There is a rich, toney presence to these springs.  The cheapest and most effective upgrade you can make on your axe is Ernie Ball strings.  Hands down the best."
114,663,4.0,"Been using this brand of strings since 1971,I've always been pleased. I like the super slinks as well. Love um"
894,663,4.0,"Standard 10-46 nickel wound set- great for most general purpose playing- like rock, blues, country, what ever. Some more advanced players might prefer boutique strings like DR, but these are good for most folks!"
1071,663,4.0,"I typically play D'Addario .010's, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these. Well I gotta say, I'm not stricken with disbelief at these, but they are very nice. Overall I would say that they feel about the same as my D'Addario strings, but if the price is right I wouldn't mind a substitution every now and again. They DO bend very nicely, obviously your guitar's scale length and your ability to bend strings may vary."
836,663,4.0,This was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings.  He found just what he needed and at a great price.
1192,663,4.0,Very good strings
172,663,4.0,These strings are Great! They Last for a real long time. They even include free picks  which is so cool. I Defiantly recommend them for everybody else!!!
1424,663,4.0,"beautiful tone and durable string, nice tension,  very good for bends, sweep picking and rakes. Did I mentioned great value?"
149,663,4.0,"My favorite strings for about 3 years now, i like the feel and the sound of this set. I use this strings with an Ibanez RG Custom with Dimarzios. Love it."
752,663,4.0,The fact of the price for this and the 18 cent shipping is pretty damn good Because I have 2 Silverstone SS-11's and a stratocaster and I took parts of of one ss-11 to fix the other then I bought these strings for it Fixed it up And now that guitar sounds better and less (Buzzy) than the strat Also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase I lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow Anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and REALLY cheap shipping I will buy more later to fix my other guitar when I get the bridge nuts replaced
1399,663,3.0,"Im sure these strings are fine, I like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my Jackson Rose. These however or the high E the Jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it... Because with a Jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings I was left with worthless strings my mistake, Just not for one of my electrics my mistake but I do love  the other strings they offer. So im out four bucks oh well."
97,16,4.0,"Bought these for my friend, he asked for these exact strings.  His guitar always sounds awesome, and I always ask his advice for musical products.  I even sound OK when I play his guitar, so I say try em out."
1236,16,4.0,"These are awesome strings! I put a set on my Strat and Tele. They offer a clean sound, feel good and can hold their own on a tremoo dive and a mad bend. I will be using this model and brand as long as they make them!Get them!"
267,16,4.0,"For the money, you cannot beat these strings. I change strings every other time I play a show (about once a month) and these always last, and sound good. Perfect for Ibanez guitars with special tuning."
909,16,4.0,"Whether you're a beginner, or have been playing for a long time, you can never go wrong with Ernie Ball strings."
561,16,4.0,Fine strings that I have been using for a VERY long time of my electric guitars. You can get some really nice sound out of these super slinky strings.
331,16,4.0,"These strings are great for all sorts of playing styles. I bought a set of 9's and 10's and I also have some D'Addario 11's. The 9's are super slinky just like the name says. They're great for quick movement around the fret board. My only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding. I play a lot of rock, and sometimes these just don't pack a punch like the 10's or 11's do. All in all though, these are great strings, and I will definitely continue to buy Ernie Ball, I'll probably opt for 10's or 11's though."
814,16,4.0,Good cheap strings for guitar. Hard to beat the price. I am not an expert on guitar strings. So I hope that helps.
184,16,4.0,I have an Epiphone es-339 and recently put these strings on it.Oh man do they sound nice. It's like I got a whole new guitar once I threw these on.Still sound good after a few weeks and they are very nice and bendy.Slinkkkkkkyyyy... :D
8,16,4.0,Very clean very bright strings i use these on my strat and it feels good and sounds amazing. if you want to use these strings for distortion you're an idiot these are something i could imagine david gilmore using
1286,16,4.0,"A great deal on what I consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there. Do the big names in the music biz use Ernie Ball strings? Yes, and for good reason. While it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety, I have found that for my USA Stratocaster, that the ease of play with the &#34;9&#34; strings is the clincher -- and they provide an amazingly full sound, with no stress on the fingers at all."
617,16,4.0,"I do like these strings. Had a few packs of these from Christmas. Opened up one recently and the .009 string or 1st string ""Was Not"" in there. Next time I'm gonna have to open up the package to make sure they're all in there, should measure them too. Didn't open them to keep them sealed until I was ready to use them, no more."
1197,16,3.0,"Good strings ..great for general guitar work, but I do prefer the EB rock n' roll strings for blues and rock playing."
876,16,4.0,My guitar playing wife loves her super slinky strings. They sound wonderful and cost very little. What's not to love?
235,16,4.0,these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings.i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best
1039,16,2.0,"Decent strings but the little E string broke while I was stringing the guitar.Other than that, they appear OK.Nothing to rave about."
816,16,3.0,Nice strings. Great sound.But rust easy.I had issues with the packaging. I used only 1 string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets.You have to use all of the strings once opened.The cheapo Musician's friend strings don't have these issues - they are individually wrapped in plastic jackets and I don't have to use all of them at one go.
1119,16,4.0,"I've been using this brand of strings for years. The super slinkys sound great. The 9 gauge is very easy to bend and on a good guitar will also sustain well. They last a long time if you wipe down after use. Better yet, get the Big Bends string cleaning wipes to increase the life of your strings."
752,16,4.0,Since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because I'm a beginner and don't have much Calais yet. Also I like the first day of new strings look Shiny! I would recommend this to any beginner.
144,493,4.0,"I have a 5 watt combo amp.  I was looking for a smoother sound, and got it in this tube.  It lacks the brutal attack of the Sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the NOS RCA gray plate I tried for over a year, but I'm really liking this sound for what it is.  I think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical, with nice natural compression, and that's what I'm getting out of this JJ."
1065,493,4.0,"Without going to extremes and spending two-hundred bucks on an NOS tube from 1957, I recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hit.JJ's tubes are well-trusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliability.BTW - 12AXT and ECC83 are the same tube.I can't remember the last time I had a JJ tube go microphonic beyond control.I have played full time for over 27 years. I use these.Hope this helps."
466,493,4.0,"Popped one of these into my Hartke LH500 Bass Head it it sounds great....the stock tube was sounding a bit harsh and this one sounds a bit cleared and more defined....nice tube,"
611,493,4.0,"I bought these when I had to re-tube my Marshall JCM800 2203KK head. This is the only tube head I have played or had so I really cant tell you how they compare to other brands but these things rock. They are very good for metal/hard rock and have lasted a year now, while gigging and practicing weekly. I was recommended to JJ by a friend who only uses them and I will likely be doing the same. I paired them with the JJ KT88s and these things just rock."
598,493,4.0,"I own a Fender '65 Reverb Reissue, and I had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very, very difficult to find. However, I bought this JJ Electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until I had enough money to afford a higher-end tube, and this blew me away. I was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound.This was well worth the small amount of money that I paid for it. In fact, I think I will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it's almost dead before I purchase another tube."
1416,493,4.0,"I opted to use the EH for its different tonal characteristics, but sometimes I still switch this one in. It's a good quality, great sounding tube. The JJ seems to be slightly more even in tone, and a little bit better sustain in the low mids, if that's what you prefer."
653,493,4.0,"Throw this bad boy in anything and it will make a world of difference, particularly if the tube being replaced was a cheap tube."
94,835,4.0,"Most 12AX7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should. Psychoacoustics being what it is, I can't honestly tell you, for sure, Electro-Harmonix tubes are measurably better than the no-name Chinese tubes I replace. But I THINK the Electro-Harmonix tubes sound better, therefore they do. At $12 per shot, who cares? I suppose I could contrive a double-blind experiment to settle the existential question empirically, but I'd rather spend my time playing. Rest assured Electro-Harmonix is GOOD stuff and the price is right. Just do it.  ;-)"
466,835,4.0,"Needed a pre amp tube for my Hartke LH500 and ordered one of these....while waiting ended up buying and using a 12AX7 Groove Tube so this one still sits in my gear bag, waiting to be powered up. If that time comes Im sure this will be a great tube."
214,835,3.0,I retubed my Carvin X-60 combo with a duet of Mullards and 3 of these EH preamp tubes. Wow - they all come to life and make the amp sizzle. The price was right from AMZ.
1416,835,4.0,"I like the tone of this one better than the stock one in my Champ and in my Kustom Kontender. Also, I like it more than the JJ, but the difference is subtle. The JJ version seems to be a bit brighter and slightly more noise (in a good way, but not what I want for me)."
1315,835,4.0,"Like the previous reviewer, I bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp, and it just did wonders to warm the sound. Only problem is, now I am eyeing my amp, all it's tubes, and thinking... if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre-amp, imagine what some of these will do in my fender! Sigh! Always something!Anyway, this is great! I am sure I will get more!"
916,294,3.0,Spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier! these can't support heavy stuff and will knock over SO easily. They sure are portable though. not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny!
843,294,4.0,"I bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction. One of the features I like is that it just doesn't take up too much room, and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store.Over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand."
749,294,3.0,"The music stand is perfect for the keyboard I am playing.  It is strong, height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly."
1212,294,4.0,Light weight... great for travel... it is perfect for what it is. It is adjustable for standing and sitting. Holds sheet music as it is intended to do. Came with a GREAT little travel bag. Folds up and sets up comfortably and easily.
1327,294,2.0,"I would say this stand is for the occasional user who doesn't put more weight than a few sheets of paper on it.The top part is not secured. It just slides on the tip of the tripod. Pick it up and carry it around, it'll come apart and scratch your Stradivarius.The foot is horrible: It sort of hooks in place with a little clamp. That means, you get ONE position. And that one doesn't look like it will live very long.Comes in a pouch, which helps to put it away.Spend more if you can."
1192,294,4.0,"It works great,it keeps my music in order.I am able to see my music.This has been a very useful tool."
582,294,4.0,"This little music stand folds up small enough (after some disassembly) to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide. Once assembled, it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books. The height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you're standing, seated on a stool or in a chair. The angle of the tray is not adjustable. The legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it, so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location. But for a portable stand, it's hard to find fault with this one, especially given the low cost."
961,837,4.0,Daughter uses this stand and was well worth the money. Exactly as described and very affortable. Would recommend this to anybody.
242,837,4.0,"I purchased the On Stage brand microphone stand to use with a theremin, although I may use it at some point for the purpose for which it was designed.  This is a substantial, stable, very solidly built stand.  The base is heavy enough the I can't image that the stand would fall over in normal use.  Should the need arise, it is also easy to disassemble and assemble.  Highly recommended."
516,837,4.0,"This stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging. If you need a boom, simply add anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackand you're good to go.In addition to being indestructible, this stand takes up far less stage (or studio) real estate than a tripod type stand like theOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand. And despite the relatively small size of the base, it is far more stable than the tripod stands. Admittedly, this stand is a great deal heavier, so if weight is an issue you may not like this type.Even with a boom fully extended I have found this stand to be stable. For outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright, which is not always the case with the tripod types. Moreover, there are no legs to break (I have lost one tripod stand to that problem.)If you transport your gear often, and especially if you play outside (or inside on cramped stages) this stand is the best choice in my opinion."
1144,837,3.0,"Not much I can say about a standard mic stand.  Unless it was a cheap piece of crap.  This one is not.  Nice heavy base plate.  Here is my only complaint:  I went to remove the UPC sticker on the shaft and now I have a mess.  I'll try some WD-40 to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud, can't anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache? And as an end user, a UPC sticker serves nobody. Why is it even there?  Put it on the box it comes in but get it off of the merchandise I'm buying!"
1126,821,4.0,"The Rat has been used by everyone from David Gilmour to Dave Grohl to give you a grasp of its range.  It does everything from light crunch, to Marshall-style thick rhythms, to all out face-melting distortion.Rich harmonics, near infinite sustain, and a mid-range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal.This pedal has not left my board since the day I bought it.  The fact that it's built like a tank ensures it's going to be around a long time after my playing days are over."
1026,821,4.0,"This is what all distortion pedals are judged by.  Adds thick creamy distortion, enhances harmonics, and maintains great attack and definition.  Sounds awesome.  True bypass."
377,821,4.0,"I have one one these from the 80's back home, and when I was looking for a new peddle, I found this was still the best around. I remember searching for the right peddle back in the 80's and going through dozens of them before settling on the Rat. And it's exactly the same... Simple, sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain. I run it through all manner of amps - including Marshalls, Vox, and even Crate, both tube and transistor, and with a few quick easy adjustments I get exactly what I'm looking for no matter the box.I'm an old school player - meaning I want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors. This is just an enhancement to my sound, and not the basis of it... though I expect anyone will get what they want from this baby."
1188,821,4.0,"After playing digital equipment for years I recently got into analog (pun intended) starting with an overdrive pedal.I had always heard a lot about the RAT and I wanted to try it out.I played a Boss DS1 at a store and thought it was a decent distortion but found it too trebly and thin.The Rat with all the knobs on 12 oclock sounds like a great rock amp. Like a perfect marshall but with more organic-ness. It really has its own tone I must add. Fat, thick, smooth and saturated. It responds to picking very well and organically.As you move the distortion knob higher, the sounds gets more and more animal. Very thick and ""furry"". The tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound. With lower settngs the tone becomes more trebly and smooth and with higher settings it gets closer to fuzz. Very nice.A nice pedal to have to be sure."
777,821,2.0,"As far as tried and true distortion pedals go, this is really just average. The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion. Compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard. However, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is. Does it have distortion? Yes. Is it valuable as such? Not in my opinion. It isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that. Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot. Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply. Not so with this pedal. You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux IMO, especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chain.Anyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for. If you prefer to play a more grungy or 70's era metal, then this will work for you. For more crisp sound, you should look elsewhere. IMO"
685,821,2.0,"Tried it, didn't like it, returned it. Just not my cup of tone, that's all. I have more use for an overdrive."
1326,453,2.0,"I like the product, i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost, i thought that it could hold a few more picks. I think i putted about 7 picks in it, but hey, it works and i would buy it again.I forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar (thats what i did, it looks good and durable).Also, It's Cheap!!!!!"
766,453,4.0,"old good design. For the price I've bought 4 of them and just put it on all guitars, so wouldn't have to search for pick again"
741,453,4.0,"This holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy. It has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something (such at the side of back of your instrument) so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand. I don't know exactly how many it holds, and the thickness of the picks makes a difference, but I've crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues."
170,453,3.0,bought roughly 5 of these...i like them and my playing buddy likes them...has a sticky bottom if you want to peal off the paper and stick on table etc.i keep one in each case..enjoy
1276,453,4.0,Very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.Only thing I can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of it.It does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.I was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.It seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor I ordered the product from.Dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.They have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.This product AS ADVERTISED DID NOT come with any picks.If you order this and need picks MAKE SURE YOU ORDER PICKS SEPARATELY.
15,453,3.0,"I am buying several more to mount on assorted amplifiers for practice room and studio.  On stage, I prefer microphone boom holders."
443,453,4.0,"Well, this is a very simple accessory, but also a very convenient one. You can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag."
715,453,4.0,My son finds that this holder comes in handy when storing his picks. He says it's easy to use and finds no difficulty removing his picks from the holder. Highly recommend!
628,453,3.0,"casual, part time guitar player here. I use it on the back of the headstock to always have picks with the guitar when I pick it up. The one I received was all black, not brown on the sides as in the photo. No matter. It is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo. I dont know if that is to accommodate a larger size of pick, or what. It is big enough that 'normal' electric guitar picks can almost turn sideways in it. It also likes to give you more than one pick at a time. Both of which I would say make it not  a contender for fast pick replacement, like in the middle of a song. But it is good for keeping them all in one place, either on the guitar or a desk, toolbox, etc.Nice little item for $2"
1388,453,4.0,"I used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month. I bought three of these Dunlop Pick Holders, one for each of the three gauges I find myself constantly using, and they've more than paid for themselves in the short time I've had them."
347,453,4.0,"I bought this for my brother for a Christmas gift when we got him a guitar. He never used it, but not because of anything to do with the actual product"
140,453,2.0,"I ordered the one in the photo, with brown sides and got a standard black one.  I have the black one on my Fender Stratocaster and wanted the brown one for my acoustic.  Unfortunately they sent the wrong one but I'll use it anyway.  It's also not the same size as the one in the photo, much wider.I wish I had the right one as the one I got doesn't match the guitar.  I know if I put up a fuss they would send the right one, but it would cost more to send this back than I paid for it.I will say that these are a must have if you're tired of searching for picks.  Finish playing, slide your pick into this and it's there when you play again."
369,453,3.0,Have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar. So it is just used as a pick holder so my picks have some places to go. Can hold up to 11 picks of .50 thickness. I use Tortex Guitar Pick of that thickness.
1334,453,3.0,It a simple holder that it's really good to make sure that you will not be out of picks when you need then!
1095,453,4.0,I can't write a great review for this. There's nothing to write about. This is a pick holder. It holds my picks. End of story. Price was right.
586,453,4.0,"I like this so much, I bought 4 and going back for more. Spring loaded pick holder holds about 20 to 25 picks. There is a peel and stick on the back to attach it to a guitar strap or behind the headstock.  I Keep one in each guitar case. I am ordering more for stocking stuffers for my musician friends. Fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick."
690,453,3.0,"its a one dollar pice of plastic that holds your picks, it has a spring in it that pushes them up like a dispenser in a way. has sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your guitar or case so you always have picks."
595,453,4.0,"Well-conceived, spring loaded slot holes multiple picks.  It is small and can be affixed (self-adhering) to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play.  Inexpensive solution and quite handy."
1113,453,4.0,"This is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere.  One note: this does NOT come with any picks.  One customer said it did, but mine did not.  It has a sticky pad on the back, and sticks well to a wood guitar.  I even moved it once, and it still sticks fine.  It is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out."
1020,453,4.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pick holder!  This is the second pick holder like this, that I have purchased (for different family members)."
1239,453,4.0,Has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place. Easy to reach and nice to have on hand.
5,453,4.0,"Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder, this is very handled, always forget were my pick got off too, now I know my Picks is in the holder."
1263,453,4.0,"I bought one of these for a friend of mine, and he said it was the best thing he'd ever used to keep his picks out where he can readily get to them. I bought two more today."
1031,453,3.0,I liked the fact i can insert more than 5 picks and they really stand tight and don't fall down. But the original glue was not string enought and the holder has fallen on the ground.
225,453,4.0,Great product.  I have ordered 6 or 7 or these.
39,453,2.0,"It's a great pick holder, but I'm not fond of the sticky background.  Something 'clip-on' would have been more useful."
8,453,4.0,Holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar
1061,453,4.0,All three of my kids have a guitar. They were always losing their picks. This pick holder is the neatest thing I have seen in a while! All of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar. I highly recommend this pick holder to anyone who needs help keeping up with their guitar picks!
121,453,3.0,"A little bigger than my other pick holder, so the pics aren't as fluid sliding in and out. Great price though."
967,453,3.0,I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold.  This one sticks well to the guitar.  Locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar.  Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle. So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it.  I might try it somewhere on the strap.
839,453,4.0,"I placed mine on the back side of my amp, in a safe from bump spot. I keep a few picks in it for easy access and I always know where to find them. The double stick tape that came on it has worked well. It's a cost effective way to always have a few picks handy and not loose in a pocket, getting lost. Try one."
68,453,4.0,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks.  She loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics.  I stuck this on her amp so she would not mis-place it.
266,453,2.0,I've never had these before until recently. I ordered a set and it worked so well that I BOUGHT a couple more. The couple more that came in had a wider slot on them. I thought that was weird but didn't think to much about it until I started moving some PICS AROUND. Turns out the wider opened ones might work but not as well. This Picks fall out way easier than the smaller slotted ones.
1394,453,4.0,NO MORE misplaced or lost picks!  This handy little device will fit perfectly in any out-of-the-way spot on your instrument.
163,453,4.0,I have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele. I can't imagine life without this pick holder -- before I was always losing picks and then I had to strum with my fingers which I don't like doing. Get one of these if you play with a pick!
221,885,4.0,"This is the best cleaning product I've ever used. Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards, but I also use it on the headstock if it's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele. What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant, beautiful and lively tone. Really brings out the beauty of true wood. Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new. Application method is also very useful. I don't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards; I put it on my Stratocaster's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful. The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker. I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell (nowhere near overpowering), and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood. Great stuff. Go ahead and buy it."
15,885,4.0,"By far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass.  Applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets, wipes right up.  A must to keep wood looking fresh."
1388,885,3.0,"I'd say if you own a guitar with a rosewood fretboard, this should be a mandatory purchase for your prized possession. Just one bottle of this should last years and years. I also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents. I used this the other night to &#34;feed&#34; the rosewood on my Telecaster, and this difference was night and day."
1105,885,2.0,"I was hoping the Lemon oil would be what I needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but, it's not very good at that. I suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry. Once clean, the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood - even where years of playing have taken their toll. It's a good finish but, not the place to start. The product is not meant to be used on maple. Don't know why but, not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark, exotic woods. So far, so good."
1277,885,4.0,Makes the fretboard feel like new; but best to clean with alcohol wipes first. I think most woods will appreciate being treated with this oil; especially in dry environments.
1042,885,4.0,Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color! Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle. A great investment that'll last quite a long time.
875,885,3.0,Its really secure far as not spilling out of the bottle. The only bad thing is you have to squeeze really hard to get the oil out.
462,885,4.0,I've had an old beginner Ukulele sitting in a closet for years.  I have much nicer ones now and decided that rather than lend them out for playing I'd fix up this beginner uke as a loaner.  I took off the strings and realized how dull and dry looking the fret board had become.  I used this product and it really soaked it up fast.  Now it looks beautiful again.  Very satisfied with how it worked.
1183,885,3.0,"It's oil....what more do you want?Turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion. IMMEDIATELY wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away. Let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.It's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary. Don't saturate the fretboard and walk away, wood absorbs oil, too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling, losing shape and flatness. Not a good situation.Lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby. It's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean....like your frets...hint hint.Just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper."
1423,885,4.0,"I love this stuff. I've tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best. And in case you are wondering, it comes with a cloth cap attached to the bottle under the twist off cap so all you have to do is turn the bottle upside down and clean away. You may need an additional cloth in the beginning to wipe off the excess liquid because the bottle is full when you first get it (of course). I highly recommend this product."
346,885,4.0,"This will make your fretboard smile!  It takes a dry, faded, fretboard and makes it look like new.  A few dabs goes a long way so this 4 ounce bottle should last you a long time.  If your fretboard is really dry & faded, apply heavily and allow it soak in.  Continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry.  I was amazed at how this made a dull & faded 40 year old Fender fretboard came back to life."
1318,885,4.0,"I love this stuff for all my fretboards, except for unusually dirty ones.  If it is super grundgy, clean it with something stronger, than follow-up with this stuff.  Leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel.  I usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time."
438,885,4.0,Works great - keeps all my fretboards looking great.  Even though I change strings frequently on my twelve (12) acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever.  I play hard for several hours almost every day and I'm always amazed at the &#34;crud&#34; that accumulates on the fretboards. (Guess I'll have to stop eating Cheetos while I'm playing - just kidding...) This oil breaks down the &#34;crud&#34; and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition.  No issues / no problems only positive things to say about the oil...
1052,885,3.0,I have quite a few guitars and I like to keep them clean and polished. This stuff is great for my fretboard and I use it every time I change the strings.
250,885,3.0,"Lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job. As the label warns: do NOT to use on Maple-wood frets (mostly Fender strats) due to the softer & lighter quality. It is only for the harder, darker woods like mahogany (which I have) or ebony (high quality - i.e. expensive - used best for fretless). The solution is perfect, but the applicator (attached to the neck of the bottle) could be better. I would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100% cotton cloth.This solution has been made specifically for use on guitars, though I think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores. It's only 4-oz, but what little is used each time, this bottle should last the guitar owner his/her life."
582,885,3.0,"This is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars. This only gets done once a year on the average guitar, so if you're like me, this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes. Other than that, it is what it is and does what it says. The applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow.The label says NOT to use this product on maple fingerboards. Doesn't say why, but my guess is it will discolor them, so be forewarned."
888,799,3.0,"But the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio.  There's a slight hiss too.  But I enjoyed listening to it while playing.  And when you attach the headphones it works great.  Amazine that it works off a 9v battery.  Yes, you have to lug around a guitar cord, but what do you expect.  I went all out and got a Roland Cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects.  But that costs 2x or more as much.  I am in the process of returning it.  Look at the picture of it next to a Coke can.  That's what it looks like.  Some people complained that the handle doesn't work.  Who cares.  The tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too.  But that's sort of what you're getting."
977,799,3.0,"for the price you can't really beat this little amp, the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up, the little speaker gets kinda muddy, but for a bright clean tone it works well, the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain.the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody, but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes... but for the money it's a great buy"
1115,799,2.0,"not bad, if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie...make sure thingie outputs at least500 mA if you can ...tried mic, bass, and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing...all workand the distortion control... mostlly notnecessary for me, but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too...it is a cutie and works for fun,and u might get loudness around 90 dBA onsome frequencies...  not bad at all...even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing...a good thing. for the price it is worth..."
858,799,4.0,This is a cool little amp. Sure it's really nothing to write home about but I like being able to take My Strat and just sit somewhere and jam without having to have a Generator to supply the power to conventional Amps. I wouldn't perform with it but great for personal use........
908,799,4.0,"I 'm obviously not a &#34;Techie&#34;.  I couldn't understand how my delightful, and so neat, little toy wouldn't work... until I found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane - A-ha!To be fair I must explain that the battery was already installed in the tiny little amp when it arrived, so I didn't look too closely at it.  But of course when I couldn't get it to work for me, I soon discovered the problem.This product is the neatest, sweetest little delight for the eyes...and will astound you with it's capacity to roar out your music when turned up fully and respond immediately to your slightest touch on it's sweet little knobs to sound out your music from there and down to a whisper,  whenever you require it to.The sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell...no static at all...Truly an amazing little gadget... attractive, so portable and does the job of one twice, or more,  of it's size."
35,270,4.0,"I play bass in a lot of different environments, and I never know what to expect before I show up. If I am playing a venue where I can use my head and 4x12 combo I know I'll have great tone. If I am going direct into the board I am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer. This unit gives me ;the ability to still go direct, but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth. I suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more. if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try. I love it."
1140,270,4.0,"DI bass is the worst. Just really, really awful. Every ordinary DI box I've tried yields this thin, cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light. So when I started playing live weekly, I just hauled my bass amp around to each gig, because it was out of the question that I would rely on a weird sounding DI box to carry the day.I live in Phoenix. I made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in 115 degree weather before I decided there had to be another way.When I first got this pedal, I would run it parallel with the amp, terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound. After a few performances, I let go and left the amp at home. The Bass Attack pedal did not disappoint. Ever since, I just bring a bass and this pedal. Running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound. I don't miss the amp at all.I did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived, just tweaking knobs until it was perfect. You'll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass, and some of the settings I tried were less than ideal for my instrument. But once I got it locked in, I've never touched the knobs again. I just plug in and everything sounds magical."
503,270,4.0,"I rated it at 5 stars because 5 stars means &#34;I Love it&#34; in Amazon's selection of things .  I do love it.  In fact I think it is better than my Sans Amp Bass DI which costs more.  Don't get me wrong, the Sans Amp is still great.  I just find this easier to dial in, it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp.  The only down side is that it doesn't come with an AC power adapter.  That isn't a problem for me since I have many power options on my pedal boards.  This takes the standard negative polarity center like Boss pedals.If you have been playing bass for a while, you know that no matter how good your bass rig is, you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your amp...that being said............I am in my 50s and I play mostly guitar hero music like Robin Trower, SRV, Hendrix, Yes, Rush, and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc............. the fun old rock n roll stuff.Like the Sans Amp, putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better. You can easily get the live Chris Squier or Geddy Lee sound. The older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple.  The tone that I love to dial in is that old 3 piece rock band sound from years past. Think of Mel from Grand Funk Railroad or old James Gang in the Joe Walsh Days, Johnny winter, and the Cream........ that over driven cranked Ampeg or Fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a 3 piece power band.I am running this into an Ampeg Bass combo and I have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous.  Playing bass is a side gig for me since I am mainly a lead guitarist........  I let my bassist try it (he also uses a Sans Amp Bass DI at our gigs) and he immediately went online and purchased one.He is another cool use for this pedal.  If you are a guitarist, put it in front of your guitar amp.  The punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible.  Try it."
59,270,4.0,"This thing sounds great! I run two outputs from this into my DAW (Reaper), so that I can have a direct DI for reamping and the regular tone from the Hartke's preamp for an overall bass tone. The general sound of it is warm with plenty of low end, and the ""Shape"" control is pretty cool for adding a little bit of distortion/break-up for layering. It's easy to reamp with, so layering the unshaped Hartke tone + another track of shaped ""gritty"" tone can get you some seriously solid sounding bass tones in a mix - especially for higher gain metal playing.Awesome unit for the price, very happy with it."
892,270,4.0,"I'm using this as a DI box for recording. It does some compression, overdrive, EQ'ing, notch EQ'ing, and excite-ing all in one pedal. So compared to the original bass signal, you get this clear, deep, punchy sound that fits right into a mix.The Bass Attack sounds a lot like a SansAmp Bass Driver but at 1/3 the price. One difference is that it has an additional ""Shape"" knob, which is a lot like the ISF knob on Blackstar products, and is a notch filter. The other difference is that the SansAmp uses tougher chassis and components, so would last longer for the gigging musician. But don't take me wrong, the Bass Attack uses a solid metal chassis and doesn't feel cheap at all.The Harmonics knob adds some overdrive, and gets kind of farty when turned up 100% but sounds pretty good at 75-90%. It doesn't do that high gain super gritty/fizzy distortion though, for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output, or duplicate the track in your DAW and add a distortion plugin.This pedal is very versatile. I found that the Shape knob is indispensable; it takes the place of a mid control. For example, by notching (reducing) the boomy 60-130 Hz region and turning up the level, you get plenty more mids. The treble and bright control seem very similar to each other, one seems to amplify the 4k region, the other the 5k but that's just an estimate. By keeping both of those around 10 o'clock and the Shape control beneath 115 Hz, I can get a solid, deep, yet mid-full sound for a metal mix. Thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids, ought to try settings along those lines.Another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48V phantom power. As in, no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer. In conclusion, for recording, you can duplicate the SansAmp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the Bass Attack, and tweak it further via the Shape control. And yes, the various button pushes get you four different sounds total, but I prefer having both buttons on. Then in my DAW I only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great. This pedal is a steal for no frills bass DI recording."
706,22,4.0,These were great. I can't brag on them enough. I AM however an electric gitty player primarily. I just use an acoustic when on trips and for couch songwriting.
946,22,4.0,I use these strings on my practice guitar because the smaller strings are easier on my fingers. I can play all day without my fingers hurting and they still sound good.
391,22,3.0,"I normally buy D'Addario Strings here. I buy the .011 or .012 strings.  This is my first time playing Ernie Ball since I first began learning.  When I first started on guitar I put .009 electric Ernie Ball on my acoustic so I could handle the pain and keep learning.  Then I went to D'Addario strings.  I wanted to try these since the under $5 price is good.They sound nice.  They don't sound as crisp as the D'Addario strings. They sound more mellow and not as BOLD.  They are 80/20 and I prefer those to the other strings out there.  I can't say I love them or I hate them.  I will probably stick with D'Addario since I don't find any difference in them.  I bought some other Ernie Ball strings on Amazon that I will try soon. For the price I would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them.  I don't think they sound bad and if they do, it did not cost much to test them.  enjoy"
1421,22,3.0,"I have used Ernie Ball strings on my Les Paul for quite a while, Slinkys mostly.  I recently bought a Yamaha FG700S and quickly found that the high E string had a very ""tinny"" tone.  I searched the net to see if this was comon with this model, alas I found that it is.So I decided to try some different strings to see if it would help.  I ordered a set of Earthwood Lights and installed them last night.Wow, what a difference.  First the tone is much softer on the E string, second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3.  The strings that came on the guitar were Yamaha light strings but they were very stiff, especially the B string.  After a hour of playing with the Earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable, both tonally and physically.  Not sure how they will last, time will tell.Good strings I would recommend them."
954,110,4.0,"To all heavy music guitarist, I highly recommend this one! Try a set of this and you will feel like a rock star!"
758,110,4.0,"I got a pair of these strings in early august, i still have them, but being as doubtful as i am, i just bought an extra pair from this seller ( who shipped amazingly fast, it got here in about 3 days!)any ways, the strings stay bright for a long time, don't/have not lost there color yet/rusted (after a little more than four months)and they are everything a guitar player looks for in strings. i do a lot of string bends and these have just held up to it. I have a B.C Rich SOB Avenge, so i can't tell you what its like with a tremolo, but i just like them. I have tried out GHS, First act, Dunlop, and D'addario's and these are the only ones that have last for so long with out showing any signs of significant wear."
258,110,4.0,Great strings. They last longer than some of the others and easy to re-string the guitarother brands do not seem to stand up to Ernie Balls
1052,110,3.0,I almost always use Ernie Ball strings on my electric guitars. I've been using them for 30 years and never have been let down by the quality and sound.
457,110,4.0,"At one point I had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat, but then I smartened up, worked my calluses to the point where I could probably play 13-62's tuned to E with no trouble, and realized that these strings worked great for my strat, because of the strong tone that these provide, and ease of bending on the upper frets. These strings also are good for Les Pauls, where the scale length is shorter than the Fender guitars, making bending like velvet."
1399,110,4.0,"For the price they are awesome strings.... I like the sound(I like a little heavier sound), and I'm hoping the high E will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge &#34;its always the first to go&#34;. You cant beat the price on amazon I paid 9.50 at my music store but I needed strings ASAP, I will order back ups at this price."
72,280,3.0,"These perform well on single coils, specifically Telecasters.  Right now I switch back and forth between Power and Beefy, with Fenders being my next choice followed by D'Addario."
1287,280,4.0,"I've used all sorts of strings over the years, and generally aim for GHS strings. However, these Power Slinky strings are great. I've not broken one yet, and the 11-48 is a good gauge. Heavy, powerful, and they sound nice and soulful when played. I may become a lifelong Ernie Ball user after using these strings."
981,280,4.0,"I replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it. . . once.normally, after tuning new strings for the first time, I break them in by rigorously bending them, using the whammy bar and tugging on them then I re-tune them. I rinse and repeat until the tuning stays. not with these strings. tuned them once, no breaking in.it sounds amazing on clean; on its own without any effects, and the natural sustain is great. they also sound good with any settings I use.i bought two sets."
715,280,4.0,I bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son. He says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality. I purchase these strings a lot for my son...you can't beat the price for these quality guitar strings. An added plus...they're made in the USA.
560,280,4.0,I definitely enjoy these and I highly recommend them! They are used by other artists that approve of them! Slash from Guns n' Roses uses them.
342,280,4.0,i been using these for over thirty years and they have always served me well.I like 11s because for me it has a nice balance between strong steady sounding power chords while the top end is slinky enough to play leads hence the Power Slinky name.
1183,280,4.0,"They were a little too much for the Squier Bullet I put them on, even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck.While I had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness. More metal moving over a guitar pickup = hotter sound, more gain, and on a Stratocaster more glass and bell like tones.I've used Ernie Ball's Slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades. They never break, they stay in tune after stretching, and they sound great. Lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound.Fun fact: Get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery. There is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound RINGing out of your amplifier. :) A little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent. :)"
384,280,4.0,"worked for me. Got no complaints over these. Very smooth and lasted me a while. Love Ernie Ball strings, they are the only ones I get"
45,884,4.0,These sound good on my electrics. The best sound I got was on my LP. Good sustain and strings are staying in tune well.
156,884,3.0,"its good but not fitting my requirement, but its extremely recommend it for beginners because it is very easy to play and bend.. but for me as a reggae rhythm guitar its not good and not warm enough and i have one point on the G string specially if you want to lead and solo whenever you start bending you will notice how annoying its because its hard to keep in tune while bending if you used to medium G size"
332,884,4.0,"This is my first time using a hybrid mix and ti does take some getting used to but I enjoy the heavier bass sounds it provides while maintain easy to bend higher strings. Installed with no problems, plays pretty well so far. It stays in tune pretty well, it's still the first day and the pitch is holding well."
41,884,4.0,"After using D'Addario strings I've try to Ernie Ball strings. I have ten years ago with Ernie Ball strings and let me tell you that it's the best strings. In comparison with Regular Slinky, this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk, clasical rock and indie sound. I have an Stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres."
1204,884,4.0,these strings are different and really quite nice.  the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend.  the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings.  I really like them.  only possible difficulty is that high E etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string.  I have a bunch of these on hand for my  strat and my Epiphone as well the standard Earnie Balls
135,884,2.0,Alright strings. Nothing too spectacular about them.  I'm a fan of beefier lows and thinner highs but at the end of the day they're still slinks.
615,884,4.0,"I bought these to beef up the bottom end of a Telecaster that came from the factory with a set of Fender 9's that topped out at .042 on the low E, which is just too small for good twangy bass.  I've been using them for a few months now and haven't broken one even though I can bend the high E to touch the D string.  I use D'Addarios on my other guitars but tried these Ernie Balls just for the hybrid mix and there isn't a whole lot of difference.  D'Addario sells a similar set called EXL125 so maybe I'll try those next but for now these are good."
384,884,4.0,"the only strings I get are Ernie Ball strings. Really reliable, great sound, got no complaints here really. Ernie Ball knows how to do strings"
691,457,4.0,"If you are looking to walk around while you play your guitar, then you might want to look into something longer. As a spare cable to play at home though, it's pretty good."
888,457,3.0,"There's another brand out there that is almost identical in construction and quality and costs less.  Don't buy the high rated chrome capped one's, I had problems with those.  This one is good just that I regret paying so much for it."
599,457,4.0,It's a guitar cable.  It works.  It appears to be well made and durable.  There is no noise or hum. It works and I like.
1118,457,3.0,"I finally bought into the Monster Cable hype; albeit with a 6' practice cable. I CAN honestly tell a difference. That difference being silence; no abnormal hissing or popping that I got from my other, cheaper cables. This isn't the top-of-the-line Monster, but still a step up from what I'd been using. I'll definitely upgrade my longer cables to Monster, and may even see how the expensive one sounds (a short one 1st, of course!)."
977,457,4.0,"I gave it a 5 star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks, but this 6ft cord is taller than i am which means it's about 6' 2&#34; tall... it's a great product for the money exspecially if it's just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp, it's short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working"
735,457,4.0,"Monster Standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price. It's flexible (unlike some of their more expensive cable), quiet, solid, and durable. It's much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables. For the money, it's really hard to beat. I won't waste money on the more expensive cables again."
220,457,3.0,these are great cables but i gave it a four because i after playing the cheap rotosound cables i learned they are just as good and are only 3 bucks. still a great cable and these sound slightly better than rotosound but thats if you are super observant because their isnt much of a difference.
318,457,4.0,"I'm a keyboard player, and in the past I had been spending $40-$60 for Monster's ""delegated"" keyboard cables.  But suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use, causing me to question the ""Monster mystique.""  I began to compare the Monster keyboard cables with cheap, ""off-brand"" guitar cables and couldn't hear any difference.  No question it's a well-made, trustworthy (but not indestructible or infallible) cable, but I'm no longer committed to it at any price.  However, at Amazon's current ""value"" price for this particular Monster cable, it's a no-brainer.  Moreover, I no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn't say ""piano"" or ""keyboard"" on it.  (One of my Monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument--but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club.)As for length, 6 feet is ideal if you're playing through your own amp (my preference).  If you're plugging into a board or P.A. system, you'll want anywhere from 12 feet to 25 feet."
1159,457,4.0,"It's made by monster cable. Need I say more? Of course it's a great cable, and being able to change the rubber band on the ends is nice to identify which cable is which."
177,457,4.0,Great cable for patching in and rocking out. It is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well. 100% Recommend to anyone looking for a good quality (without an over the top price) cable!!
961,411,4.0,My daughter has been using these strings for many years now and they work great. Excellent price and product is as described and price was right.
484,411,4.0,It was recomended that I get new strings when I bought my violin and these worked great. They are steel coiled so they were fine with my electric violin but did take some time to stretch a bit to hold a tuning which was a bit discouraging at first. They've been great since.
372,411,4.0,"This string set offers typical D'Addario quality and value. I use D'Addario strings on all my guitars, mandos and my ancient old fiddle."
1014,411,2.0,I prefer Shar's Overture premieres which are the same price.  These ones are a little too &#34;bright&#34; in sound and not deep or resonant enough.  Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior - but for which you would be paying $50 a set.
885,411,4.0,"D'Addario Prelude Violin String Set, 4/4 Scale, Medium Tension is good deal for beginners. It's good enough, not expensive. Try it till you ready to by more expensive string."
960,411,4.0,awesome cheap repalcement string i would recommend them to anyone who doesnt want to spend 50 bucks on high quality strings
227,193,2.0,"I play guitar.  I bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago.  They're very interesting.  These are soft rubber with a little bit of give, so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies, similar to using your thumb, but not exactly.  I still pull one of these out every once in awhile.  In certain applications, getting a particular sound for a song, say, these could be exactly what you're looking for.  Overall these are well made, and the ones I bought will probably last me forever, but these would never work for me as a main pick.  I'm glad I tried them though, as I have nothing else remotely like them."
449,193,3.0,My fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought. So I guess she loves it as that is the only pick I've now seen her use. [She has been playing for over 35yrs]
1367,193,4.0,"I love that these eliminate pick noise, but don't expect to use these on your electric guitar--they're simply too fat at 3.11mm.  They work well on bass and acoustic, however.  Don't go with the 'Soft' version--they have too much give and tend to stick to your strings and leave you without a pick."
1101,193,3.0,Saves your thumb on the strum;grips nicely in your fingers but not on the strings;A Totem of Rock and Roll in your grip.
450,193,4.0,"This is the 5th bass pick that I have tried, and finally this works great.  It does not slide out your hand and has a soft tip with a nice sound."
824,193,2.0,"I am a converted guitar player and I like playing with a pick.  I like that sharp thwack sound.  But the tone can be a little harsh, so I got these.  They are much quieter than a hard pick but the tone is not the same as bare fingers.  For me, they were a waste of money."
1143,193,3.0,"**Update 9/7/12**Ok I've been using these for a few weeks now, and I have to say I keep going back to them. They make the notes sound like bells. It's holding up better than I expected (I am a relatively soft player) and I'm adjusting to the 'stickiness' mentioned below. I am liking these more and more as time goes by. Glad I tried these!**Original Review**Recently I got the itch to try different 'unique' picks... these, the dunlop primetones, felt picks, metal picks, etc. I get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks.These are interesting. They perform quietly and give a more mellow tone. They do however stick to the strings and it becomes difficult to use them, will need some getting used to. I wish I had ordered the hard version rather than the medium, as these are a bit softer than I was hoping.Probably won't be a daily driver, but interesting none the less."
581,193,4.0,"The best part of this pick is that it is easier on my strings, it still gives the pick tone, but seems to do less damage."
955,103,4.0,"I usually play my Jazz Bass fingerstyle, but there are songs where I prefer a pick, especially when I need speed and accuracy. Until I found the hard Wedgie rubber pick, I used a heavy Fender pick, but didn't like the sharp pick sound very much.I bought a set of soft, medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and I'm really happy with the results. I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke, I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgie's really nice for my Jazz Bass. I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the Wedgie's are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments. I prefer the 3.1mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes, but that's entirely subjective.I'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me."
32,103,2.0,not my style but they work ok. thought i would give them a try. shipping was quick and i know a lot of players that like them just not for me
1232,103,4.0,"Playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings, I've preferred just to strum using my fingers because ""traditional"" plastic picks are just too harsh and loud.  Even felt picks are too harsh (not to mention the dust/shedding they do).The Wedgie is EXACTLY what I've been looking for. Harder than my thumb, softer than plastic or felt, the 3.1mm Hard Rubber Wedgie is the Goldilocks pick; right in the butter zone.I tried the ""Soft"" and ""Medium"" Wedgies, but both were just too soft.  The Soft Wedgie over-grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone.  The Medium is better, but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft.But the Hard Wedgie is the clear winner.  I get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings.The only negatives I've found are:1. They can leave skid marks on your pick guard.  No big deal, as it wipes right off.2. They break down faster than I'd like.  Of course, that could just be my expectations.Still, if you're looking a softer-than-plastic pick, this is the one to get. No pick noise, just strings. I couldn't be happier."
1256,103,0.0,"I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead."
980,103,1.0,"I purchased these picks, because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band. We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise. I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise. They don't make that annoying plastic to metal sound, but they are very flexible. I need to have alot of pick speed. These slow me down way to much. The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to."
774,103,1.0,"I should have read the reviews carefully - it's definitely something different, but not sturdy at all, rubber bits come off as you strum, and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers. Ouch! I'm much happier with my Friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked!And who cares about hard pick sounds anyway? If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming, why don't you use&#8230; your fingers?"
227,639,2.0,"I've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised.  I don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there to a small degree.  To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic.  Well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack.  It doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine. I wouldn't want it to be my everyday acoustic tone, though.THey fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some ""sparkle"".  But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable.  The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to.The bottom line:  I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't really see them becoming my go-to picks.  I like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations.  I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers.  Worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright.  You know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up."
955,639,4.0,"I usually just use my fingers to strum my tenor uke, but there are songs where a pick is more appropriate. I used to have an old felt pick made back in the 1940s, but it disintegrated over time and the newer felt picks I've found just don't feel the same.I bought a set of soft, medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and I'm really happy with the results. I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke, I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgie's really nice for my Jazz Bass. I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the Wedgie's are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments.I'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me."
1058,639,4.0,"It's a great pick for a soft sound, I wouldn't use it for aggressive  work, but for slow ballads  it's great."
189,639,3.0,"Bought these because I thought they'd be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when I want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce.  They give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string, and they don't wear down the strings and I actually use them on occasion for my 3/4 steel string acoustic guitar when I want a nice mellow tone.  The only negative is that because of being rubber, they &#34;stick&#34; to the strings, so they aren't great for quick strumming, which I wish they were."
1023,639,4.0,"First time for a  soft wedgie......pick that is (I did have an older brother : ) ). I used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great. Very good price and looks like they will last awhile.I highly recommend they for you to try, if you don't like they you can give a fellow musian a &#34;soft wedgie&#34; which they just may like."
660,639,4.0,"I like these picks for use with my ukulele, it makes strumming a lot easier on these old hands of mine. It sounds exactly like the sound you make while strumming with your fingers, and they seem to be sturdy enough to last awhile. A worthwhile buy for tired fingers :-)"
1229,639,3.0,"I purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgie's as an add-on to a larger order. As such, I found them to be a reasonable value. However, I'm not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic. I think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or ""uke"". They are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort.I love the very soft warm sound they provide. I use them mostly late at night when I can't sleep and want to play, but the rest of the family is still sleeping. Not quite as effective on the E, A, and D steel strings but certainly playable. Not so great for strumming, but fun to pick individual chords. Thanks.SPO"
1362,639,0.0,"These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go."
778,843,4.0,"My partner won't put a pickup in his guitar and I get tires of luggin' an amp around (along with the rest of the sys) so this does the trick. Clip on the boom stand, stick a SM 57 on it and an SM 58 to sing in and your set. Holds tight."
132,843,3.0,"The one I got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw. I feel like if I tighten it too much, I could dent my mic stand tube. But I haven't dented anything yet, so perhaps I'm just too skeptical. In any event, it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction. But everything works. It's getting the job done and I haven't seen a better option. All in all, a pretty good device."
516,843,4.0,"I use this to mount to hi-hat or cymbal stands, as well as on mic stands. See my customer-supplied photos at the top of the page for examples.One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi-hat stands. I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck, Blackto connect to the bar, then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone. The bar-gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model.This also works well for mounting on microphone stands. I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones, or a DM80 for baritones. Again, it works perfectly for my situations.I always keep a few of these, plus various size goosenecks, just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands. It's one more tool to make set up less stressful."
810,843,4.0,"I use to mount a portable digital recorder onto the side of a mic stand. Very stable clamp mechanism, works very well. Price is good. Nice to have in your gadget bag."
641,843,4.0,"I have a crowded rig already and the las thing I wanted was another mic stand.  I already have a straight stand with a Shure SH55 mounted on it as a talkback to call tunes to my band members.  I wanted to eliminate my wireless sax mic, as I was using it infrequently, and decided to mount a Heil Fin on this extension arm on the same stand as the talkback.  Nice and stable - no issues - works perfectly."
848,843,1.0,I tried it for iPad. It kinda wobbles up and down. It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad.  I only recommend it for something light weight.  There's better ones out there. See my review on the music stand. That comes with a solid extension arm...
798,843,0.0,"OK, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. I bought it without hesitation. HOWEVER(!), once hooked up, I was very surprised how flimsy it is. I have a 13"" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. Obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. Using it at home, I've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. Since then, I've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though I haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, AND only costs a few bucks more (On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom). For anyone considering this product, I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom. You will be far far happier.Cheers!"
658,661,4.0,These things grab the mic and won't let go. They are worth the extra cost. Buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping.
355,661,4.0,"Sturdy mic clip on a budget. Mic fits snugly into the clip, allowing the rage to commence. Will purchase more as needed."
4,661,4.0,"I was upset when I bought the mic stand and didn't know the clip didn't come with it.So I had to order a clip later.Nevertheless, It has good design to dampen the shocks.It is also rubber in construction so it won't crack like the other low quality clips.It is a bit big for the cabled mics (so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag), but for wireless mics, it is good.I would recommend it."
425,661,3.0,"It is a nice clip, works for my mics.I don't like the soft opening. It makes you not easy to put back the mics."
932,643,4.0,It is exactly as represented. It does a fine job. I have used it in recording live band practice sessions. I would if necessary purchase this item again.
302,643,2.0,This is another adapter that I rarely use and now that I have a digital mixer I am not sure if I will ever get much use out of them with my rig. Traveling about to use some other rig though you never know what you might run into so I plan on keeping these little artifacts for a while longer.
1349,643,3.0,I didn't need anything high dollar so this was just what I needed.  Does have a cheaper feel than the other (much more expensive units I've used).
1052,643,3.0,These plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for. If I buy more in the future I will be checking here first.
1049,643,4.0,Took a while to find what I needed but this is what I needed!  Free shipping.  Exactly what I needed at a great price!
55,643,4.0,"I notice mixed reviews here.  I suppose when an item sells for $2 instead of $20 there may be a potential for quality control issues.  But hey, buy 3 of them and if even one turns out to be bad, you're still way ahead on the deal.  Seems to me as good as any connector I've ever bought."
469,644,4.0,these have worked great when I've needed to have 1/4 input vs the xlr......especially when I bust out the old Tascam 4 track cassette...some times I like recording drums analog versus digital or other instruments
672,644,4.0,"This works just as stated.  Now I can plug my mic in either way,  and it gives me more versitility"
904,644,3.0,"Works well and it's clean no noise, i'm starting to find out even if the price is low it does'nt mean it's not good."
1074,644,4.0,"Whats not to  love, inexpensive, and does it's job....After reading some of the rather poor reviews, I checked it out for  signs of poor quality or workmanship... Only thing I found was that  the pin rockrd a bit... there were three screws in the body that I used a screwdiriver to tighten up.. .I suspect that complaints of falling apart could have been from missing or loose screws... Not much of a chore. I did back out the screws a bit and added a drop of clear nail polish on the threads for some insurance that it would not loosen up...Anyway, that is the view from where I sit...Just got it and used it, I will add to the post if things turn bad.."
1314,644,4.0,"Works great, no issues. Bought this to adapt the mike plug to 1/4"" jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to ""karaoke"" with."
314,644,3.0,"Useful for connecting mics to a guitar amp or directly into a computer's mic jack. The 1/4"" side tends to become a bit loose after a while, not sure if it affects performance though."
302,644,2.0,As the digital realm and the audio realm become one things like these will become increasingly rare. You will always find a place that does not keep up with the times though.That alone is a good enough reason to keep stuff like this around for now.
943,644,4.0,"The Shure XLR Female to Male 1/4"" Adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit.I've got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to.Now this one as pictured is the mono version, which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced 1/4"" jack. If you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable, this adapter will not work for you. You'll need the TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) balanced version of this adapter."
833,644,3.0,"I purchased this to interface the XLR plug on a Sennheiser E825-S mike with the input on guitar amplifiers. it seemed to work very well in this role. It was well-constructed, with all the connecting points working precisely and securely.Somewhat after the fact, I started worrying about whether I should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities. I'm hardly a professional technician in this area, but I did do enough research to figure out a good working answer: Lo-Z (low impedance) microphones (say, 1,000 ohms or less) generally do not have to be matched to solid-state amplifiers, which are likely to have Hi-Z (high impedance) inputs in the range of 10,000 ohms. These amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 10:1 impedance ratio (load to source). I calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 0.83 decibels, which is incidental.This corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works just fine without impedance matching. I can't say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if I have a chance to find out.UPDATE: since I wrote my initial review, I have discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws. If you purchase this item, I suggest you have a micro-screwdriver set handy so you can tighten everything up before you discover to your chagrin that a loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector to fall apart."
1049,644,4.0,"Anyone who works with PA and sound equipment needs these adapters.  For this price, you can't beat the item.  I've had no problems with the ones I've bought."
571,644,4.0,"These little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered, allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks; I simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead. And, they produce no audible hum into the circuit. They are unbalanced jacks, though (note the single black band at the end of the plug,) so if you need balanced jacks for your system (those with two black bands,) make sure you take that into account before ordering. By the way, I have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording. Just saying..."
1298,612,4.0,This is a perfect compliment to my current set up. I needed a desktop stand for voice overs when my usual recording set up wouldn't do the trick. This stand is sturdy and worked perfectly. A great buy as the price was perfect as well.
355,612,4.0,"This is a really solid table mic stand, and you're not going to find a better price (I looked). The base is solid and heavy, and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube. I liked the first one enough that I ordered a second. I should note, though, that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips, which I can imagine being disappointing even though it didn't affect me."
139,612,3.0,"This item really speaks for itself. It is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop. The base is nice and weighted, but not too heavy to be unwieldy. It's a solid piece that serves its purpose and offers convenience for anyone looking to place a microphone on their desk.I would recommend you grab a shock-mount with this if you don't already have one, as it transfers vibrations though the stand! But that is honestly to be expected."
1059,612,3.0,"This stand works fine if you don't need a shock mount.  The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations.  I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount.  The low height (4 1/2"") - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop.  If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic, you're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black.BTW, my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread."
563,612,4.0,"If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone, this one works well. It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over, and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk. Having the microphone always plugged in, accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voice-over work."
1142,612,2.0,"This mic stand is solid and a good value, but it's a one trick pony. The picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect (the stand comes with 5/8&#34; threads and does not come with an adapter). Not a huge deal if you're using a standard mic clip.The height is about 4.5&#34; inches total and I'm using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port. If you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop, I'd highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from On Stage. I have one of those too, but it was too tall (even at it's shortest setting) to mic my drum port, but the adjustable height is very handy."
27,197,3.0,"This pedal is outstanding for the price.  The feel is great and it doesn't move at all when you put it down on the floor.  The only thing I disliked was that it doesn't support ""half dampening"" like most of the higher end pedals around this price range.I got this for Christmas of 2007 and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio.Great product"
888,197,4.0,Works great.  I have the same effect on my 49 Alesis midi keyboard as I do with my more expensive Yamaha keyboard which has a sustain pedal.  Chrome is great quality and it has good weight so it's not tinny.
508,197,4.0,ino...u wana buy one of those 9.99 cheap pedals from ebay n the likes right?...NOPE!...cause when yeh doits gonna flak out after about the 10th push you do on it!!! Listen to the Voice of Experience grrr....hahahthese pedals are frikn TANKS heavy duty all the way and have a polarity switch [and yeh there's alota keyboards out thereu gota have that perc...It's worth it...just suck it up n get the thing and if you still need a momentary dsp switch then buy the lil 9.99 jobbut only use it in life or death situations..hahah [they have a really cheap plastic switch thats destined to die no matter what..at least the previous 2 i bought did...*ouch...* so is that like 20 hail mary's for that confession????.......
1294,197,4.0,Just got mine - fast shipping from amazon thank you :)It has a great weight to it very similar to a real piano.  I was a little lost when i plugged it into my Yamaha S90ES - similar to the newer versionYamaha S90XS 88-key Balanced Weighted Hammer Action synth(I SHOULD OF READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BOX)  - the polarity needed to be changed on the pedal found on the back!woops - i was in constant sustain there for a minute - scared me that my pedal was broken.anyways it instantly makes my awesome electronic keyboard sound so much like a real deal pricey piano!awesome!
461,197,4.0,"fist off, guitar center had this for 29 bucks!!! I KNOW RIGHT. It was in front of the tag for this (30 bucks) and the sp-1 for 14.99 so I got it, but it was in the wrong spot, I went, got the price tag, and after minimal drama, they gave it to me for the price they had it INCORRECTLY listed.that said, the pedal is great. The problem people have with the pedal, as I can see it, if they say it or not, is that some sounds DON'T HAVE THE SAME SUSTAIN AS A PIANO OR SYNTH SOUND. It has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to ""pump the pedal"" to keep sustain and not ""wash out"" the tone. this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth (I have a casio wtk-4200 I believe), it is as good as you need. As said, any over-sustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again, which is the true art of it. 30 bucks? robbers."
584,197,4.0,"Wonderful, piano feel, piano action. Will partly sustain if pressed late or let go and reapplied briefly, i didn't even think my keyboard was up to that sort of responsivness (cheapo Yamaha). This is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three. I am a future M Audio customer from here on."
1246,197,4.0,This pedal is very nice. It looks much more expensive than the actual price and works great. You can just plug it into your keyboard and play. It works very well.
423,197,2.0,"I had to send my first one back. The second one is working fine so far. I've noticed it works better with some DAWs than others, also. If you are having problems with it, it could be you DAW software. It works great with Reaper."
252,197,4.0,I bought this for my M-Audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my Casio Lighted Keyboard.Just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection.This is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano.
1100,197,4.0,"I bought this sustain pedal for my iRig Keys Midi Controller, I had an On Stage pedal (square), but that was crap. This M-Audio is awesome, it doesn't move from where I put it on the floor, it sustains the note how it supossed to, and it feels very well. So far it's still working, and it has a switch button to use with any keyboard. I would buy it again!!"
478,197,4.0,"well made, works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic."
641,197,4.0,"a well built pedal of good quality, with enough weight to keep the body stable, and a good &#34;middle of the travel&#34; execution point for sustain.  With the correct keyboard, the pedal will also allow for half pedaling.**very important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers, especially older models; this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment (for most newer keyboards this doesn't matter, as polarity can be edited globally, or, alternatively, polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in)  Some other pedals, particularly those from name manufacturers, will only work with some keyboards.  That said, I feel this M-audio compares favorably to it's most visible competition, Yamaha's FC4 offering.  The Yamaha pedal is a bit heavier, which I do like and subjectively implies better quality, but, in reality, the Yamaha did not last under the same circumstances, breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road.  Last,  the Yamaha FC4 does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch, making this M-audio pedal a great all around option.In my case, this pedal has been on the live stage, unpacked and packed, tossed around a fair bit, for 2 1/2 years with no problems."
1018,197,4.0,Works great - very good feel - we have it on carpet and it works well on the carpetMy wife loves it - if I needed two I would buy another
457,197,4.0,"There isn't much to say other than if you are a keyboardist, and are in need of a durable, high quality sustain pedal, BUY THIS PEDAL!"
811,197,4.0,You don't really need an expensive sustain pedal unless you're a concert pianist playing on a $10k keyboard- nuff said.
1082,197,4.0,This pedal has a solid feel under my foot and gives me the 'push-back' I expect when playing live gigs.  Always welcomed is the fact is stays in place where I put it on both wood or carpeted surfaces.
1027,197,4.0,I bought 2 of these as controllers for my Alesis drum machine. One starts/stops the drum pattern and the other triggers the fill and change pattern from A to B. These things stay put and work every time.
1142,197,4.0,"Beautiful pedal, nice chrome foot piece, weighted so as to have a substantial feel, quiet, and rubber bottom so as not to slip around.  An all-around solid purchase for the low price I found on Amazon.  Love it."
1257,87,1.0,"I thought I could take the smell. I couldn't.Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.The case is nice too, but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools. (sulfur?)I tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell, get one."
1261,87,2.0,"This is a great guitar once you change the strings, as suggested. Great portability for the price.HOWEVER - having read reviews across multiple sites, I too am a victim of the HORRIBLE glue smell that so many others have complained about. I really liked the guitar, so I purhcased it from two separate retailers, but had to return both due to the horrific smell. I even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a ""smell-free"" case... And they sent a case. But it stunk too. It's a shame, I had to return them, because they were nice little guitars."
480,87,3.0,"Don't expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won't be disappointed. That said, I find it useful for composing on the road. Heck, it even sounds better than my big guitars, in an odd way, for certain songs. Nice sturdy and portable case. Not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags, but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask. Action is adequate for practice--with a little tweaking it's actually good. Quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors."
157,87,4.0,"I wanted a guitar I could travel with, something small enough that I actually would carry around after the novelty wore off. This is a great size. I love the large neck size, while it is smaller than a full size guitar, you wont feel it much while playing. The sound for something this size is really good, do not expect to get a full acoustic sound. This guitar is just for you to practice scales, practice a tune.. you wont be performing with this guitar. I did alot of research bought a cheap travel guitar (which I hated, threw it out) and decided I wanted a better one, compared this to the Martin Backpacker and this has the better sound, the better bag, and all around GREAT travel guitar. The travel case is great, its about the size of a violin case so you know the size.."
1217,87,4.0,"We got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar. As expected, it doesn't have the sound quality of a full-size instrument, but it sounds good for what it is. It seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it. The blue color is pretty, and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar (case, strap, etc). Other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap. We did notice a scent, but it didn't bother anyone. A more odor-sensitive person might feel differently."
109,87,4.0,"I was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of Afganistan. I was going to get the Martin Backpacker, which I have actually seen and held in a store, but other reviews sold me on this Washburn. The case was a particular positive point for me, and so was the 25% lower price. I am more than please with what I have received. The case is great for a traveling soldier, rugged and protective, with useful pockets. The Guitar itself is very well made, nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument. It does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body, common to the type, as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold, since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body, and you can't exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic. The thing is, this guitar is just plain fun, it is always handy, durable, and plays pretty well. Best buy I have made on a product I couldn't try out first. A testament to the quality of the reviews on Amazon, which have rarely led me astray."
1153,87,4.0,"Picked up some Blue Steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone. Also was the last to pick it up for $118.50 shipped to my door. If you like a parlor guitar, this might be for you. The case is kick ass too, easily a $50 value.Update: After putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner, along with putting on new strings, this guitar rocks. Putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone. This is my go-to guitar. Sounds good and has great intonation. The only fore-seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning. I have a washburn D-30 and love this just as much for 1/3 the cost."
916,44,4.0,"This thing is awesome! really nice looking, and heavy duty. Costs a few bucks, but is very high quality, seems like it will last for ever."
999,44,4.0,"After reading the reviews, I expected the leather to be a tougher than it is. It's soft without being limp. There's no break-in time required. I bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great. I like to keep a pre-adjusted strap in each guitar case, and I'm planning to buy another one of these for my Martin."
907,44,4.0,This guitar strap is wide and well made of good quality leather.Just what I needed.I am very happy with it and thank you. Rich B.
879,44,4.0,"I like simple guitar straps without too much glitz and yet wide enough for the shoulder and attractive, yet simple."
77,44,4.0,"Love the looks,it does what I need,holds guitar,looks great,priced right,anyone thinking of one should get it!great service when ordered!"
1034,44,3.0,"I liked the strap, used it for many years and it held up great. The texture almost looks fake though."
980,44,4.0,"Very nice leather strap, I will like it better when it is worn in, and softer, but excellent for holding the weight of a five string bass.I very much recommend it, along with some Dunlop straploks."
282,44,2.0,"I bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar. I would have given this item 5 stars but even fully extended it is about 3&#34;-4&#34; too short. As for the quality of the strap, I love the look and feel of the leather. It has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer.My 2 cents in summary- I think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric, this strap would work much better. If you have a larger sized guitar, find a longer strap."
146,44,2.0,"Reviews described strap as &#34;soft&#34; and &#34;weathered&#34; which sounded good to me.  Actual description is a blasted &#34;design&#34; which is what you get.  Strap is quite stiff, but I'd say it's worth the price.  I would have preferred something different."
1311,44,4.0,"This is a very good nicely wide guitar strap.  Its weathered look is exactly what I was looking for.  Its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades.  That is what I wanted but that is also why I got it weathered - to speed up about 5 years of personality.  I'm not sure how you would wear it out really.  Its buttery soft and doesn't have a strange fabric suede backing so it won't muck up your clothes, pill or crumble.The only minus is that its a standard 53 inches though the description says its ""long"".  Pretty standard vs all other straps.I paired this with my reissue Fender Telecaster Thinline in natural.  It looks wonderful.  I can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it.-------------Update: Since I got the strap as a Christmas gift I've worn it to class and jam sessions.  I started getting nice compliments about the guitar.  Thought the guitar IS beautiful I've had it for a while.  I think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar!  Beauty and Function."
48,402,4.0,"I've been recording professionally for 27 years; Music, radio commercials and television mostly. So I'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase.I've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years I can't remember them all but I can I say I've never had a bad A-T. 4033's, 4050's and 4080's I use every week and have for years, the 4033 going back to the mid 90's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the A-T family. You have no idea the % of recordings that you're hearing this brand on, it's used by almost every studio on every continent, I work in the US, Italy to Scotland and can attest to this. But first let me tell you, very simply, where the negative reviewers went wrong.This is a XLR connection phantom powered mic, which is pro and best. So it requires a phantom powered XLR input, which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces. Which you should really purchase along with this, if you haven't already, because for around $100 you'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring, you'll find one by searching audio interfaces. I have a RolandRoland TRI CAPTURE Audio Interfaceand a Focusrite I use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don't need Avid HD's to get started. Audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter. Getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been SOP since the dawn of digital. I see that small USB mixers are available which would be another option. Don't try an adapter on it, it won't work, as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor, but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want. It doesn't come with the cord, what a surprise! Quality cords will cost about half the price of this, but a $15 version will probably do for most.It doesn't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like. Work with it, you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do. You'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeShure Popper Stopper Pop Filteris the usual, but I can also recommend using 2 large $1.49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen. This isn't about being cheap, there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don't work at strange angles and you'll probably always need one or the other.This does not come with a stand, so pick up a boom stand if you don't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over, 18 wheelers also tip over.RecommendedUse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they've put a faux plastic one. If it's possible, you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks, eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the wayMicrophone Flange Male. For desktop users, here's what I'd do. Using large Command strips and Velcro I'd fasten this to the deskAdjustable Desk Microphone Standand attach thisTelescoping Mini-BoomHere's another optionMXL Mics MXL-BCD-STANDUnderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting, if you need something figure it out, your clean, quiet recording is proof that it works.I can't justify comparing this to my $500 to $4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it. $82 wouldn't have bought a case for most of my condensers. It sure beats most non electret, electrostatic DC bias or dynamic style mics. The 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue. Also individual mics have a sound, of the eight 4033's I have, I prefer 3 of them and use them the most. So when reviewers say it's bright, I say compared to what? I can tell you what it sounds like.....KA-CHING! a great sound in audio recording. Uh huh, I know of one professional recording it's on and the client was clueless that I used an $82 mic. Think about it, would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago? Have you heard good 70's recordings? Anyone purchasing equipment because it ""sounds"" better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it. Lot's of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don't ignore them but ask yourself this, do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities? Any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $400 and won't be half of what you'll achieve by improving your recording technique.This type of mic is excellent for overhead, acoustics, amps or brass and of course vocals, really most recording needs, having a less uni and more omni, cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it's better suited to recording. Just understand you can't get too loud near it or you'll overdrive it since it's designed for up to screaming vocals, so back off with loud amps and brass, which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it'll pick up your AC ducts and your neighbor's TV. That, is a good thing, what's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment, so don't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise. You can't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind, just quiet, anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical, rather than electronic, signal to noise ratio. A 10db pad will reduce output but doesn't affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won't help, that's not even its purpose, I suggest reading this on acoustics and foam, music.tutsplus dot com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-acoustic-treatment--audio-1274 (just replace the [dot]). Turn off your heat/air, be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 AM, when the world's a quieter place and that will really help, you'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are. You can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls, or buy used office partitions but you need quiet, I've known acoustic players who've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing. If this is what your budget allows for it's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost. I keep saying ""this type of mic"" and the reason why is because A-T sells 14 models like this style up to $3000. This model is the lowest priced but you're buying a reputable brand. If your future plans include using only one mic, without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware, you can look here.Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB MicrophoneOr hereAudio Technica AT2020USB+ Cardioid Condenser Microphone w/Pop FilterThis is not my advice, you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface. This model is not USB.Now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds, I won't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio, descriptions are worthless, only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters. This is important, all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn't, the recording cannot sound better than the source, so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone. Accurate or inaccurate, not good or bad, there's a difference. It's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound. Apply these same thoughts to your home stereo, saying instead, playback cannot sound better than the recording and that's why accuracy is important in your monitors.So search out any info you don't understand and don't expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling, training and having worked in a professional setting. If you're lucky like I was, after 1 year of tech school I worked on site repair (studios often need PT) and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3, then after 3 years of work (TV) with another year of school I became a studio owner. Real recording involves a facility, equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital. So study electronics, acoustics, the auditory cortex, everything audio, train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day, it never stops. When making any purchases I recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn't mean you're educated in its use. So yes, I also don't recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother, unless.....But everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording, quit all that sleeping, eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record! Just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk, I have. So keep up the research because no man knows it all and I'm just here to help you out. If you need a good, small, inexpensive stereo amp check this one out. Topping TP22 Digital Mini Amplifier"
165,402,4.0,"This mike is a great way to start recording at home. I use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball. I know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price. However, I find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home."
829,402,4.0,great price for good mike.  I did not want to spend a lot to start.  I got a good mike at a great price ($50)
1130,402,3.0,Microphone is quite good for such price. The sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones. Recommend for small budget studios.
941,402,4.0,Whatever good things you've heard about the at2020 is probably true! Well.. unless if you've heard it will sprout wings and save you if you falling from the sky... but it sounds great when your recording songs! Haha! I record with fl studio and it's even great so far! I recommend you get this!!
1266,402,4.0,Love it...nice mic to record acoustical instruments... 13 more words?.... word word word word word word word word word word...
1209,402,4.0,This was exactly what I needed for the price range I could afford in a crunch.  My old mic just wasn't cutting it going into my computers USB audio interface.There are nice changes in sound texture from different angles.  It is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals.  It is recording my guitar beautifully.I've even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar.  I've set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole (slightly back) and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little.  I found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean.I'm very happy with this unit (price considered but I'd have to pay a LOT more to improved on it).  I'll probably get another one.  I kind of wish I'd have bought that combo kit.
1208,402,4.0,"I use this at home for rough tracks and have also used it at work for voice over. Its worked great. Very happy with it. Its not a $2000 quality mic but it its a good mic for the money. Some of the tone can be a little tricky sometimes, but for the price its expected to not have it sound like butter."
406,402,2.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but, I have a completely different view. The AT2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh. Second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser. It is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts, but there are a bunch of better mics near this price. Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 (stay away from the studio projects C1) both exceptional microphones for the price. Although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing, the MXL 2003a. A lot of people have claimed the studio projects C1 sounds like the Neumann u87 it doesn't, the MXL 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under $500. With that being said the AT2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great, to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone.Although to be fair I have a lot of experience in pro audio and production, so I maybe a bit overly critical. One thing is for sure though; there are definitely better mics in or near this price range."
659,402,4.0,"Works exceedingly well for any use. Whether dubbing audio, recording instruments, or just yelling at the top of your lungs. No issues and pretty sure I will never have any."
717,829,4.0,"Great strings. I use these on a Deering Goodtime II and they work well. Deering recommends (as I imagine most entry level banjo manufacturers) sticking with only the light gauge, not light pluses or mediums. So stock up. Good strings, and not overly prone to corrosion."
63,829,4.0,"I bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo. Strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel. One person may love them the next may not. They are very playable strings, but on my aluminum rim saga banjo the sound was a little to bright. I took them off and put them on a another wood resonater banjo, they sounded much better on that one. One reason I buy these strings is they are made in the U.S.A Why buy strings when they don't tell you where there made.I put on a set of Daddrio medium set and liked the sound better but they are a little harder to play.All strings must be kept clean if you want them to last. wipe each string when done and they will last longer."
210,829,4.0,"Well, I ordered 2 sets of these, and 2 sets of medium strings when I got my first banjo, as I didn't know what gauge strings I would prefer. So far I like the light strings better for clawhammer, which is mostly what I play. Easy on the fingers and sound good, to my ears at least...Not much else to say about strings :P. Would recommend them."
1410,829,4.0,"I love these strings because the sounds are so pure and not twangy, and they are pretty easy to use.  Each string is labeled so you know which goes where.  I'm a beginner and can change my own strings, so I'm proud of myself."
801,829,2.0,"As far as banjo strings go, these are a good bang for the buck, or were when I got them. D'Addario makes a pretty consistant product, I've used them on everything over the years, although I prefer certain brands for other things. Strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with. These are also amazingly enough still made in the USA as well.If you buy a cheap instrument here, do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they'll be strung with trash if it's a lower end instrument from China. Even if you're starting out you should tell the difference right away."
469,291,4.0,it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price.....works great with moonflowers and lasers I have gotten...the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights....I really wanted to use it Halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn't want it out on the porch.....next year!
1227,291,2.0,This fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up.  The fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy.  It's ok but not the best fog machine out there.
997,291,4.0,"Great device and good price...My Wife made me try this for a Gig we had... It worked great! I love the foggy effect on stage, with a touch of lighting it really comes to life.The fog juice this thing comes with has a funky scent though. Perhaps it might be wise to get some scent thingie to toss in the tank with the juice. I don't know if the other brands of fog juice smells weird also but I have another can of juice I bought to use later. I will report on that...I gave it 5 stars although the fog juice is funky because it's not the fog juice that matters, it's how the machine works... It does what it should do."
27,291,3.0,"Dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too long.I got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds.  This beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job.It does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what it's supposed to.  Also note that the cap on the machine doesn't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much.Keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later.  It's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground.Overall build quality is very nice.  Metal case, compact, nice bracket, lighted remote telling you when it's ready.The threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy..."
670,291,2.0,"Recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party, upon installation and testing, the unit blew a fuse..Going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing, if not, I'll be returning mine.. will update...UPDATE.. Radio Shack carries the correct fuses for this unit, upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected..Leaks a bit while using , so dont stand under it...But most on these things leak anyway.."
507,291,2.0,"Great for video/photo work or even theater. It won't handle well at a large space. If you are a light fog, this is the job for almost any situation.What I'll be using it forDj work to show laser beams and light beamsVideo work - use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site (that's what you are seeing in movies)Photo work - not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an ISO."
560,85,4.0,I enjoy using it and its helpful when you wanna use it to hold up your sheet music to a viewable point and your books too! I recommend it!
1204,85,4.0,"i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room.  this does the trick just fine.  it is light, sort of cheap, etc., but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg.  I wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home, practicing, it is just fine."
299,85,4.0,"It is a basic music stand, but it is sturdy enough to hold sheet music or books, does not wable and there is no play between the folding elements. You can expect to pay three times as much for a similar product at a local music store, great value"
311,85,4.0,"this is a great music stand.Very sturdy.Very well built.Just wish it came with a bag,then it could be put in the guitar case,but ill find one thanks"
390,85,4.0,I was surprised at the good quality for such a little price. It does exactly what I needed it for.
20,85,3.0,"From the other reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but this is a nice stand for the money. I use it and my granddaughter uses it as well. It is sturdy, easy to fold away and easy to setup. The leg spread can be adjusted for space if necessary. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good valued stand."
464,589,4.0,Works just fine. Except the bottom part (that is supposed to support the guitar) swivels. Not sure what that's about. But I'm not very picky and know nothing about guitar stands so maybe it's supposed to.
1326,589,1.0,"The material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. The only things i don't like are 2.1)Each of the corners has a cap. The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)The part at the bottom that looks like a U (used to hold the guitar) it spins... It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one."
191,589,4.0,"This is a very useful item, easy to build and setup, easy to use. I don't have any problem with this stand at all.And all of those people who have problems with the arms that move when you touch them, that is part of the design. It should not be a problem to you, or your guitar.Thanks, Austin Garcia"
546,589,4.0,"In life you mostly get what you pay for. This stand really isn't an exception. Getting what you pay for though doesn't mean that it won't do what you need it to do. This stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it. The great thing is, it doesn't need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do. It's a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played. Even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case.For $10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar. Putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play. You now have no excuse for your expensive (or cheap) guitar to get beat up from laying around."
725,589,4.0,It does what its supposed to. I really like that the bottom is adjustable and gets the guitar higher or lower off the floor as needed.  A great price and a good item.
234,589,4.0,"It's really hard to beat this product for the price.  I found it sturdy, well built, and a great fit for my guitar.  I really appreciate the low, wide stance, which is great insurance against accident prone guitar players such as myself!"
53,589,4.0,"Better than I expect,,, I going to order 2 more... very stable,, easy to assemble  and a nice price .."
130,589,3.0,"Not perfect but a solid stand. Prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do. And the bottom part that holds the guitar isn't fixed so it's good and bad. Good because it'll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles. Bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do, sometimes it just swings around annoyingly."
63,589,4.0,And works well for it. My only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal. I don't know how long it will last. I might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole. But the price is right and the stand is solid enough. All areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last.
511,589,4.0,"We picked up the ""XCG4 Guitar Stand"" for my daughter's acoustic guitar and it is exactly what was needed! Here are my observations:Pros -+ Stable; once setup and tightened down, this is very sturdy+ Adjustable; the height and base can be configured to accommodate the guitar+ Security Strap; has a rubber strap that hold the neck securlyCons -- Slight chemical smell that dissipates after a few daysThis is a good value for a very functional and good looking guitar stand.Highly Recommended!CFH"
594,589,4.0,Bought stand as a gift for my son's acoustic guitar.  He loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand.  Can't go wrong for the price.
1029,589,4.0,yes this is a great guitar stand nice cushion has a lock strap I'm very happy don't mind standing my les Paul custom pro guitar in this baby
212,589,3.0,"I bought one of these for each of my electric guitars (3) and really like them. They work great, were easy to assemble, and not expensive. I do think the name is a bit inapproriate because I would never use one on stage, I don't think they are sturdy enough. These are great if you don't have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them. I realize you won't normally have pets or children on stage, but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over. I recommend the On Stage XCG4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe. I use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely. Great deal for the very low price."
562,589,4.0,This is great if you have to put your guitar down but don't want to put it in its case.
347,589,4.0,It came and it wasn't broken or bad and it held my brother's guitar for a few years until he sold it
918,589,4.0,"Simple, no frills, stand.  Only problem I've had lately is that the velveteen padding on top seems to get loose and keeps coming off.  A lil' glue will fix it, just haven't had time!"
261,589,3.0,Still a great product it's just a little flimsy. The way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem! It doesn't attach! It just slides in and then you kinda just hope it doesn't bend or break. The only problem is if you are clumsy like me you might push your guitar down into it a little to hard and damage it.
805,589,4.0,"I purchased this for my son's acoustic guitar.  I was tired of finding it not in its case and lying on the floor, or against his dresser.  Since he got this stand, his guitar has been put away on it every time.  The security strap is a nice feature, to make sure the guitar doesn't get knocked off the stand.  Great value for the money!"
349,589,2.0,"Not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand, not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive. No assembly instructions were included in the packaging. I've never owned something like this before, so that was annoying. Luckily, some nice pictures were posted on the web page and I was able to figure it out from there. Once I got it put together, and placed my beloved guitar in the thing, I got happier. It looks nice and holds the guitar safely (padding protects the guitar finish). I'd recommend this stand to others, but be aware of shipping, tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions. Not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together, still..."
635,589,4.0,"This is basically the same as the other stand I rated, just from a different manufacturer.  Same basic materials, you can't go wrong with either.  See my other review for the World Tour GS-1 Folding Tripod Guitar Stand.  Honestly, I can't tell them apart since I threw out the boxes."
326,589,4.0,"Easy to take apart, to put together, to store, and pretty stable when in use. Not the cheapest but worth the money."
907,589,4.0,Strong and won't tip.price is very affordable.I own several and have had no trouble with them.Buy it and you will see.
1056,589,4.0,"No much to these things, but they are cheap and they work great in the studio.  They shipped quickly and didn't break the bank."
492,589,4.0,For the price you cannot go wrong with this.  Holds my Les Paul and feels secure.  I've never had any issues with this.  Don't bother spending 3-4x as much for something that does the job as well as this.EDIT - Bought another one this Christmas for another guitar and this one feels as good and as simple as the first one.
1407,589,3.0,"I have several stands, and this is the second one of these I bought. It works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar."
198,589,3.0,"The On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand is a decent quality simple guitar stand like almost all the others, so here is how I rated it. There are really high quality stand of the same design, but i will not use those stands as a comparison.  Seriously, the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt.  If you somehow made one that retails for over $30 and are able to sell it, I applaud your marketing team.Continuing on, this is how I rated the On Stage XCG4:If it were over $13, it would have gotten 3 stars.Between $7 and $13, earns it 4 stars.if it were under $7, it would have gotten 5 stars.I hope this helps,~JP.S.  The currency is in US dollars.  Please adjust accordingly."
584,589,4.0,"I paid 10 dollars for this. It must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it's not cheap at all. Folds up for transport, works great on hardwood floors, padded where it needs to be, and has a strap so it doesn't fall forward either. Angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet, look for something where the legs 'enter' the carpet more straight down."
899,589,3.0,I am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items. Once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product. It holds your guitar up.
1293,589,2.0,"Got what I paid for.  Worth the money, definitely.  Sturdy and stable and I need more words so I can ...done"
1160,589,3.0,I have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable.  My acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand.
452,589,4.0,This is my first guitar stand and I have to say I am pretty happy with it.  It's made of good quality metal and you can tell it's much higher quality than the price tells it to be.  The neck strap and the base are excellent.  Made of great padding to pad the bottom and can put any guitar base on there.  Look at the other reviews and you won't be disappointed.  It didn't smell like the other reviews said either.
466,589,2.0,"You get what you pay for. This is a no-nonsense cheap guitar stand. Its adjustable, padded, and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you, a stage groupie, or your clumsy drummer trip on it, the whole mess falls over. This is perfect for your Fender Starcaster or screaming pink Hello Kitty guitar. This is not a good choice for your prized 1968 Jimi Hendrix Strat or 1964 Eric Clapton Gibson ES335. You might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those."
1057,589,4.0,I picked up another one of these for a new guitar and I'm very impressed.  They've upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one I purchased a few years ago.  Excellent stand!
189,589,4.0,What a great price and product!  Bought two of these so I can keep my guitars handy and I love them.  Really love having the rubber strap to secure the neck in the event of a mishap.  The wide frame legs make the stand extremely sturdy and love that it can come apart easy if I want to pack it up.
1020,589,4.0,"This stand is great!  It is solid, but light weight enought to move as needed.  The footprint is small & meets are needs well."
958,589,4.0,"This is a great stand, it looks the same as any other, but it works great for about 10 dollars"
196,589,3.0,"This is more of a like it or hate kind of item. If it doesn't work, you hate it. If it works, there's nothing impressive about a stand, so I just like it."
992,589,4.0,"For a ten spot, ya can't do better. Matte flat black finish is nice.Great durable foam contact points for cradling baby.Double dog dare ya to do better.You just cannot. Excellent deal !!"
1425,589,3.0,"I've picked up a few of these for my various guitars.  I've found it to be steady and stable and it hasn't left a mark on either my large archtop or my Les Paul.  The little locking strap that goes across the neck cradle is a big plus too.  I've seen plenty of lesser stands for more money, so this one is  my first choice these days."
785,589,3.0,"Works good, nothing special. I have to say I disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell. My big nose can't confirm that. Maybe they corrected the problem if one exited."
368,589,4.0,cant b beat for the cost. it does jusy exactly whats expected. and at  10 bucks its woth every penny
807,589,4.0,"This is fine for my music room at home where it isn't likely to get bumped too hard.  I wish the bottom didn't swivel, because I don't see a need for it to do that.  But it keeps my guitar handy and does the job I wanted it to do at a low price.  I like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out.  However, I wouldn't recommend this for the stage where there are crowded conditions and it is more likely to suffer a heavy bump.  For that, you would want a larger tripod at the bottom to make it less likely to topple."
1233,589,4.0,"While it is just a stand, it seems to be sturdy and durable. Nothing special about it, but also no negatives that I can find either, than the fact that it doesn't give my foot massages. XD"
833,589,4.0,"I bought this two years ago for use with a Takamine. It hasn't seen heavy use. It wasn't supposed to. It sits in a corner of the living room, holds the guitar securely, and doesn't cause problems. Although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious, and my 91 yo neighbor was convinced for a year that I was drunk and  wailing away on the guitar at 3 am. At least, that's what she told the police.This stand is very similar to the slightly better selling Musician's Gear stand. They might actually be the same stand under different names. The pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping. If I were to buy a stand again, I would still get this one because it's available under Prime. The other one isn't. That gives this stand more value.The stand is very easy to set up. The lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar. This took a little getting used to, but it does work very well. The padding on the stand does protect my guitar well. Extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems.Given the very low price, this is an excellent choice for a living room stand. If you're on the road or performing, you might need something a bit different, but I can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself."
307,589,4.0,I have been buying these stands for years and will continue to do so.  I've taken them to the studio with me and of course used around the house.  They do what they're built for and are as described.
20,589,4.0,I really like this stand. It has a nice wide leg base and well padded neck and body holders. It is a nice solid tubuler style guitar stand and either my electric or acoustic guiter fits well in it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking a stand for their guitars.
638,589,4.0,I have a number of guitars and keep them all on stand in my music room.  This stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well.
248,589,3.0,If you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home. This is it. Have not gigged with it as yet. So no comments as to its toughness. Great value though.
908,589,0.0,"This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...Broken! OK...I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase!"
1280,589,4.0,Great for the price.  Not for guitars with nitro finish.  But I cut up a t-shirt into several long strips and wrapped them around the padding and then tied it nice and tight.  The result was a pretty cool looking stand that will protect my nitro guitars.
713,589,4.0,"It's sturdy, and very portable. The two things I was looking for.Can't really compare to the others, but for me worth the price. I didn't have one at all and this workgs great.delivered in a timely manner.thanks!"
846,589,4.0,believe it or not I've been putting off buying one... I'm so glad i got it now I love looking at my guitar in this thing and now I even want to pick the guitar up more than ever!... Id have to say im happy with the quality can't see anything to complain about really.
483,589,4.0,I have just receive mine just now.. It was awesome...I never thought that it would be so solid... It is made with steel and covered with rubber on the very edge.. Can't beat the price... I would recommend this to anybody who are looking for a guitar stand!!.. A+++
765,589,4.0,"For 10 bucks this is great, very sturdy and reliable. Works wit all my guitars, and for the price it is a steal."
1108,589,4.0,"most guitar shapes and sizes fit on this guitar stand,it is easy to assemble and theres really not much to it but the fact that its a guitar stand,nothing special about it."
542,209,4.0,I use these on my Hofner and Gibson ES-135. They sound amazing and feel fantastic. These will be the only strings to go on my Jazz guitars from now on.
86,209,1.0,"Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top.  A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end.  Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long.  I will replace with 12s however.  For me the 11s felt a little loose.  The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box.  I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model.  I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s."
33,209,4.0,"I bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since.  Awesome feel, sound and price. Just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that I do.  I know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my Strat. One thing I notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others I have tried. Thats nice."
1169,209,4.0,"These strings have a tonal quality that will change your life, if you'eve ever wondered how the greats such as Wes Montgomery, George Benson, and Larry Coryell have been able to get their awesome, mellow tones.  I'd recommend this even to metal players as a change of pace, as they may get something out of it that they've never considered before.  Obviously, this takes someone who is willing to give a change to their accustomed style of playing a try.  Trust me - I've been playing professionally for decades, and I can say that there's no way I'd turn my back on these as a jazz enthusiast.  Also, if you're interested in saving the skin on your fingers, this product will help, as I haven't even come close to the normal amount of skin shedding experienced previously on roundwounds."
1101,209,3.0,"I had put these on, and my wife picked my guitar to play, and she was confused.They do take some time getting used to.  They don't rip up your hand as much, and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift, there is less friction.  This is good, but it takes some getting used to.  I used that finger-tip friction to let me know where I was on the fretboard.  With these, I found myself over-shifting both high and low.I like them, and they sound nice, but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes."
142,209,4.0,"Flatwound? Ribbon wound?  It's all the same, no squeak, slick, jazzer mellow in tone.  It's a sound that many would like to acheive.  But why not round wounds?  Round wounds give a bit of grip, round wounds also have more surface area and are louder.  Okay, but I have a pickup, want the mellower tone, sans finger noise.  It's important for my playing to not have finger noise.I have the Les Paul for harder edged music, but the archtop jazzbox pleads for a mellower tone, hence the flats.I have a couple of friends who are really great Jazz guitar stylists, they both use D'Addario Chromes - over nickel, so I thought I would try them out.  Nice, buttery smooth and I couldn't really recognized the difference over nickel flats, except the price, and the wear seemed a bit better.Wear and tear is not really a factor for me, as I change out strings every 3 to 6 weeks depending on how much I'm playing.Not ready to take the plunge?  It is a different feel, if not, try half rounds.  They're a hybrid of both, less finger noise, a bit more surface area, hence output.  Output is not a problem if you are amplified.Check them out.  I use the medium gauge, with a 13 high E, the G is wound also.  Finger style or with a heavy Dunlap tortex pick, the attack noise is also reduced with the flats.  I like them alot."
606,209,4.0,"I'm a bassist, and am familiar with the flat/round/half-round debate on BASSES (I prefer flats). Anyway, my son wanted these for his Epiphone Casino because he heard John Lennon used (a different brand of) flat-wounds. They sound AMAZING! They make that Casino ring like a carillon, yet will get &#34;down & dirty&#34; when called for. A VERY &#34;different&#34; sound range than round wounds. In fact, it's about time to order another set or three...."
1096,209,4.0,I like a mellow sound with a smooth feel. These strings are what I needed and they perform.D'Addario ECG23 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar
397,209,4.0,"No lie, these are the perfect strings for an electric arch-top.Smooth but not dull sounding. Will defiantly be buying more."
546,561,4.0,Does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it. The handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles. Over all a nice product.
73,561,4.0,"This brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing. This is not a deep cleaning, dust or dirt removal brush; it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by Last (LAST PC Power Cleaner 3/4 Oz.).The brush is super simple to use, with the album on your turntable, hold it at roughly a ninety degree angle for about two revolutions, and then sweep it off the LP. No fuss, no muss, no fooling around. Never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers. When there is visible dust on the fibers, give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers. After each use, rotate the handle around to cover the fibers. If you press the brush too hard against the album, or do the deep dive sharp angle trick, fibers will be broken off the brush. Just press lightly against the rotating LP, sweep the brush off the LP, and all will be wonderful with this brush.This brush is sold under many different brand names, ClearAudio, AudioQuest, and Thorens.The brush comes with no instructions for use, an odd omission. Maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use, instructions would be redundant.Audiophile or not, this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings."
213,561,4.0,"This is a great addition to any stereo system today, assuming you still use your turntable.  Two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play, free of any annoying pops or clicks.  It won't save a dirty record, you'll have to buy a cleaning solution for that, but this brush will easily take care of dust, hair, and other particles that get attracted to your LPs during regular use.  As another reviewer suggested, I do the first pass with the brush going with the record, as if I was spreading out paint or something like that, and that gets most of the surface particulate free.  The second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record, and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record.  After that, your record will sound brand new again!There are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options, but none that are this easy and this cheap."
318,561,1.0,"The version I picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops.  If you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device.  Speaking more pragmatically, I've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc."
277,561,2.0,"Seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record, but frankly, the old Discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job.  Better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap (and a new paint brush), then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth.  Just try not to get the labels wet."
1092,561,4.0,This is everything you need in a record brush.  The bristles are the perfect quality and softness to get all the dust that sits between the lines of the record. Highly recommended!
954,384,4.0,"I was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot, or the floor. The strap wouldn't hold my guitar any longer. I wanted something cheap, something that don't require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it, I was worried about damaging my guitar. So I decided to get this strap lock, it rocks and it works perfectly."
271,384,2.0,"The strap locks do work... But they are kind of a pain. They are fairly large, and when I installed the second one, the pieces kept coming apart. They go back together easily, but I had to install one piece at a time.The strap lock required some effort to install on a thick leather strap, I really had to squeeze it into place.It feels safe and secure."
734,384,3.0,does not work for all guitars.  one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway I have tried. though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should
325,384,3.0,"every single guitarist that's plays live or even just practices standing up at home has that worry &#34;is my guitar gonna cut lose for my strap and fall down to the floor?&#34; well, there little fellows are a solution, they work just fine, and i think they are reliable. wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger. but i mean, good price, no need to change the guitar's built in strap buttons... 100% recommended... also, i read a review 'bout it not fitting some guy's lp... well obviously, that depends on the strap... but it use these strap locks on my lp standard 1959 vos, and they fit just fine (use it with a gibson asfb-blk strap)."
278,384,2.0,It's an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off.
403,384,4.0,"I'm using this with an Ovation Balladeer. A guitar with a rounded back that demands you use it with a guitar strap at all times. My guitar strap is over 50 years old, circa 1967, so the leather is a bit worn and it had a tendency to slide off the strap holders on the guitar at the most inopportune times.With these strap loks, the strap never comes off. I leave it on when  I put the guitar in the case, and they are there and waiting when I get it back out. I've had it on for 2 and a half months now, with no problems. The hardest part was putting them on, which really wasn't hard at all, just took a moment to understand the mechanics of the mechanism and voila' Bob's your uncle!!Recommend these for anyone who needs to keep their guitar strapped and ready for action. They are plastic and will wear out someday, I'll buy another pair then."
706,384,4.0,"I've read where people are using bottle caps instead of these. My guitar is more valuable to me than that I suppose, because I'm not trusting that my expensive gitty won't hit the floor. I mean you pay for a quality instrument right? Why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe? I'm sorry but that's just idiocy in action. This isn't 1960, get an upgrade already. I play standing up 95% of the time, so these are a necessity. I have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily, but all except one snapped right back together. When I first started playing, I had a brand new (to me) guitar hit the floor and the neck break because I didn't use them. That's something that should only happen once in your life, if at all. The only complaint I have is whatever happened to the round ones? They were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well."
579,384,4.0,"Low cost strap lock that works on most Guitars buttons. It comes two in a package. I used one on four of my Guitars, but had to install a smaller button on one Guitar. This design works best for me. Love it!"
414,384,1.0,"I purchased these as well as the Jim Dunlop 7000 locks.  I recommend the 7000 model.  They both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy.  The 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space.  You will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units.  This is true for either one of the models.  I have a regular nylon 2&#34; Levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007SI) work well, but I prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000)."
402,384,0.0,"They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. I threw mine away."
1248,384,0.0,"I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic.  The guy at Dunlop told me ""oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic"".  That is NOT the case.  I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth.  But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product.  It's called, TRAIN your people!!!"
1386,384,0.0,"Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps."
625,253,4.0,Great for the price. It is a very accesible option and does what it has to do. Must have for solos
842,253,4.0,"Doesn't color the sound, depending on how you're using it you can push the channel or get an extra channel.  I've turned a two channel amp into four with this puppy!!"
426,253,4.0,This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This is very sensitive boost pedal that will deliver as it should. I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
790,253,4.0,Excelente pedal!!! Es un boost sin saturacion excelente para las partes donde queremos que la guitarra destaque!! Indispensable!!! :D Saludos desde Venezuelaaa!!!
394,253,4.0,This thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top!I had a LPB1 that sucked tone and sounded like crap but I really need a line boost and didn't want to spend a lot for one.This little baby at about 3 o'clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs.
388,112,3.0,"I replaced the nasty, crooked, chipping plastic pins for these, and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be.  I'm not convinced that they change the sound of my D-28 very much for better or worse.  I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really couldn't tell much of a difference, still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones, so I consider them an upgrade."
212,112,3.0,I bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my Fender acoustic. These are easy to install using the instructions (or without). These are also sturdy and look very good.
224,112,4.0,"I installed these pins in my Silvertone SD10.  They fit great and are a lot better than the cheap plastic ones that were in it.  If you have a lower end guitar, I highly recommend these pins.  The saddle will make a bigger difference in sound than the pins, but every little bit helps.  For the cost, you can't beat it."
269,112,4.0,Sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs.  Next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a Tusq.  This should improve my sustain and tone even more.  If you're looking for a budget increase of tone ... this is a way to go.
1065,112,3.0,"I ordered these for a Gibson Songwriter Deluxe EC Custom Vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro-touch longer than the stock pins from Gibson.The pins measure: 28mm -or- 1 1/4"" inches in length.I was going to return them but figured I would try them out in my Gibson Blues King L-00 parlor sized guitar.It was about the same result, a little too thin, smaller heads and slightly longer but I went ahead and tried them.GLAD I DID.I didn't think that after using the Tusq bridge that came stock from Gibson it would make any detectable difference but I was wrong. I CAN tell a slight difference. I did not remove the strings, just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it, which were fresh from yesterday.A small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable.They also provide a graph in the packaging info, but I think that it was a test using BOTH the TUSQ pins AND replacement saddle. If you haven't changed your saddle...do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one.I must admit, I did order these with about 75% of ""dressing up"" the guitar in mind, and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected. I got both.White with Paua Dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy I was seeking, although there is no care taken as to ""match the dots"" for consistency, -they will vary in appearance.The TUSQ Pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way...right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar. The heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the Gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher, and I do wish that the TUSQ pins were the same size.I will see how well they do on the Blues King and most likely will order new pins for the Songwriter Deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two. I don't expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion!If in doubt, consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the ""tone"" you have in mind, be it darker, brighter, softer, louder, etc. Strings make a big difference and I find using D'Addario phosphor bronze strings very bright & ringy, last long, are affordable, and seem noticeably louder than GHS or Ernie Ball. (steel strings only - does not apply to nylon or gut strings.)Once again, if you have a plastic saddle and/or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference...then again, they might make all the difference in the world! You just have to try them and see.They are inexpensive and pretty...well worth the risk!"
252,112,4.0,"These are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were. This is exactly what I wanted since my 1973 acoustic guitar has been restrung so many times that the bridge pin holes were getting loose enough that the original plastic pins were very low and difficult to grab and pull out. These new pins fit those holes perfectly and make stringing my guitar a pleasure, again! And there is also a noticeable improvement in the sound, over that produced by the plastic pins."
1065,539,4.0,I ordered three of these ...so far!Very affordable and good quality. Made in Canada.Keeps wireless unit very snug and tight.Easy in and out with Velcro retaining strap. (all leather.)I use the little plastic flat ring on the bottom to loop my strap through which keeps it tight against the guitar strap.The width of the slots are 1 inch and 1/16&#34; or approximately 27 mm wide. The leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit.These are much better than I suspected and have a few expensive Levy's classic padded straps. They fit each other like a glove and are very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdy.If you click on the item and go to the product page I have uploaded some photos of actual use and close-ups.
314,539,2.0,"I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap. Way too small, maybe like a third of the width. I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit. However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely. So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something.UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly. But you need to attach it with something."
980,539,4.0,"I really like it!!!!!  You have to have a Levy's strap to use this but since they are the most durable and comfortable I already own two of them. I never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor. I check the battery level when I am not playing, the strap goes over the leds, but that is a minor issue. Most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries. I always use new ones so I know I have way more juice then I need for my practice or whatever.This is very ruggedly made I think it will last for ever."
51,539,4.0,"What's most impressive isn't the top-drawer leather and craftsmanship -- that goes without saying from Levy's.  it's the clever design, the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap, adjusts to almost any position, and adjusts to (almost) any small wireless transmitter.  transmitter, not receiver!"
1,160,3.0,"This came in the mail today in a rather large box. The blue LED light is fine, you can put about 5 medium picks in the Pick holder. More than enough to keep me and a friend in picks for a few songs. It is not bad but I don't think I would purchase another one."
1182,160,4.0,This unique gift put a big smile on the male teen musician in our home and that made me smile.
258,160,4.0,Great use to hold a guitar pick and to use to find your keys to open the door with.My son likes it and uses it often
948,160,4.0,"I had intended to carry this, with my keys, attached to my chain wallet. But the wallet hasn't arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater. But I suspected it would be before I ordered it so I don't count that against it. Holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight...almost annoyingly hard to get one out. Will be sure to update if wear & tear has any effect on the grip on the picks. But so far, so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends."
124,160,4.0,"I clip this pick holder to my music stand and it's always handy, and very easy to use.  I use thin picks and was able to fit four of them into this holder."
976,701,4.0,the sleek design is just great as the product does not hinder your hands and fingers while fretting a chord.  holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless.  what i really like is that the padded material is very forgiving and holds the strings without any fret buzz and never damages my guitars.  it is also just great to &#34;hang&#34; on the headstock went not in use.
738,701,2.0,"Most of the time I am able to use the G7 capo with one hand when moving it, adjusting it, and clamping it in place. However, sometimes I have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don't buzz. That may seem like not such a big deal, but I prefer to have an easier one to work with. I have small hands, and an old carpal injury, so I prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo. This one is better than the any of the clasping kinds (Keysers, etc) in that respect. After a couple of playing sessions, I figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time. Now that I've learned how best to use it, I'll keep it. When I first got it I was upset that I had to use 2 hands and forcible squeezing to put in place, but now I've learned how to work it better so that I can do most of it with one hand without too much strain.A capo should: be easy to remove and put on, stay in tune, not hurt the hands (no 2 handed squeezing), not interfere with playing when inserted, and it shouldn't break too soon (have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all).On the plus side, this unit seems pretty well made, so it should last a long time. I think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically.I've tried so many capos now, and the only ones I liked were the Planet Waves screw tops, they are easy to use, easy to move from fret to fret, light on the hands, stay in tune and out of the way, but they break in damp California weather (I've had 4 of them break on me, within a couple months. They snap and go airborn, which is dangerous). Next I'll try the Dunlop Victor capos, they are screw tops similar in style to the Planet Waves (Dunlop also makes the Planet Waves capos), but they are made with more durable bronze, so they should last longer, and I hope those will be the best for me. I also ordered an aluminum version of the Planet Waves in hopes it won't break like their thermoplastic ones do.If you have small hands like me, and don't want to strain the hands while playing, like me, then that rules out the Kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos. The Shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust, and the springtop ones are suspect as well. That's why I like the screwtops that don't get in the way and are easy to adjust. Ok, I hope the Dunlop Victor will do the job for me now, I'll try it next."
1015,701,4.0,I have owned my G7th Capo over a year now & as far as I'm concerned it beats all the others I've owned in the past hands down!! So easy to use & can clamp right on my guitar nut for ease of moving when needed.
644,701,1.0,"I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.Bottom line: If you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. For everyone else, look elsewhere."
1184,701,4.0,I bought this because after I rebuilt a guitar that was very special to me it wouldn't stay in tune. I took it to a number of guys thinking I did something wrong in the build and was just overlooking it. I use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this...I thought they were crazy. I'm not paying that much for a capo and I doubt that is the problem. Well....I broke down and I'm glad I did. This thing is amazing. It solved the problem because I can set the tension and the design make it sit just right on my strat. Spend the money...it's worth it. Only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly.
679,701,4.0,"This capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no-fuss with positive micro-action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place. Holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose. Removal is simple also, just press the release tab and it's ready to remove, no muss no fuss, it really does work that well. Highly recommend."
871,701,4.0,"I've tried Kyser capos and they're good. They work. This capo, however, just works simply, smoothly, and it's a great pleasure to operate. Like a Seagull vs a Taylor 8 series, they both work, but one has more beauty in its being. Made in China, designed in Europe, slippery, a bit heavy, but still very, very nice. It's more money than I'd have liked to have paid, but I'm glad I did. Did it improve my life? Not at all. It also didn't improve my guitar playing - but somehow it's just so much nicer to have than any other capo I've used."
1196,701,4.0,"The G7th Performance Capo is by far the nicest capo I have had in 35 years of playing. The main obstacle in using in using a capo is it throwing your guitar all out of tune every single time. Well, the G7th Performance capo is definitely the Worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune. It is easy to use. And holds all strings down completely and easily. The G7th Performance Capo is something that you will definitely not want to lose."
1080,701,4.0,I'm a beginner and I try to learn to play guitar. I was looking for many different capo's but this one was my choice base on other folks review. Is easy to apply small and sexy ;-)
1315,701,4.0,"A friend of mine who is a guitar repair genus (and budding luthier) recommended this capo when I mentioned intonation problems with my guitar...I had always had some issues with it, but it was liveable. The real problem began when I switched to different strings- silk and steels. I  LOVED the tone I was now getting, but the intonation problems were suddenly much worse.What I had not considered, until my friend mentioned it, is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth I was looking for, they are also easier to ""bend out of tune"". (Duh, I should have thought about this, it makes perfect sense in retrospect!) The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings, and  greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.So he mentioned this capo, and I immediately chortled. ($50 bucks? That's how much he payed. Yikes!)Then he grabbed his G7 from the car and let me try it. The strings stayed in tune! That's $350 on repair I can pocket for other things, at least for the time being. I was so impressed!I ordered one the next day.I am sure I will miss not being able to stick it on the usual perch when I am playing live, but it is really easy to use in general, and I won't look back. The intonation issues are greatly reduced, and I am thrilled.Worth every penny."
511,727,3.0,"We bought the Pyle-Pro Lavalier Wireless Microphone System for use with thePyle Pwma230. We needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice. For the price, this worked a lot better than I expected but it did take some adjustment to the ""Trim Screw"" on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed. We also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn't hanging in front of the speaker (this might not be an issue for you, depending on where you plug yours in).There are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that I'm sure would provide better sound and range, but this one works just fine for our uses.Overall, a good value for the low cost of this unit."
1104,727,1.0,"Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. I do however question whether the word ""Pro"" should apply to this system. Although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. To its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.After playing with the device for a couple more minutes, I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. Even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. YIKES!!! Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above. I'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes. I'll probably be returning this unit asap."
959,727,3.0,"Bought this as a back-up to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room. Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much (I don't think you can change the gain on the AT system). My only nitpick is that I'll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1/8&#34;. For the price, it's amazing. I just hope it works in the field as well."
222,727,0.0,"Arrive, in trashed packing, but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard... certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it."
990,727,4.0,"My wife & myself are a Celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed. We considered a wireless to use with a battery powered Crate Taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet & at these events no power is available. When I saw this at the price offered  and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered I thought it was worth a try. In the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn't hear the stories in the songs. We use this to give our voices a small, unobvious boost. It kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood. The result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show, laughing at the comedy, crying at the tragedy.  Our tips & cd sales have gone WAY up. Is it high fidelity? Quite simply, no. But in our case it works beautifully. Recommended, just remember the price point and you won't be disappointed."
619,804,4.0,"I LOVE this mic as an indoor studio mic.  I would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omni-directional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise.  But when the conditions are quiet like in a studio, this mic ROCKS. Clean, warm sound that picks up natural bass really well.  Good for vocals (singing), or instruments like a guitar or piano. Also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that too!Comes with a dB limiter (-16dB)switch, right on the mic.  Works really nicely at limiting background noise.I would highly recommend this especially at the price.  Comes with a decent hard case and SWEET shock mount.  Very happy overall."
1030,804,4.0,"i love it! im using this mic to record my vocals for my home made demos, it works just awesome. quality and price, im just satisfied!"
888,804,3.0,"Best sounding vocal mike for the bucks.  I tried many MXL mikes (under 200) and this was the only one that came close.  Unfortunately, the top end isn't as defined as a AT2035 or NT1-A.  So I ended up forking out 2x as much and going with the latter."
864,804,4.0,Love this little guy! I was previously using a Blue USB Snowball. This just sounds so much fuller and more real.
959,804,4.0,"For years I've owned a nice AT4033. Recently I've wanted to be able to ""double-mic"" vocals for vocal doubling ambiance, chorus effect, etc., but didn't have the cash for another AT4033 or similar. After searching the net extensively, I kept seeing the MXL770 rated very highly and decided to take the plunge and figured I'll just return it if it's not any good. Wow! I can't hear any discernible difference when simultaneously recording the AT4033 on the left channel and the MXL770 on the right channel. They both sound great and I think the MXL even looks better and feels just as solid as the AT. A definite keeper.It's great that advancements in design and engineering are producing high quality products for the masses at rock bottom prices ($69). Who says you can't afford the ""good"" stuff these days. Keep it up technology gurus!"
1164,804,4.0,This Mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our Studio's here at [...] Tune in and check it out I think you will agree. Sounds great and at the Right Price
355,223,4.0,"This shelf is exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price. I used this on my wall-mount 4U rack to hold my modem and router near my switch. As an added bonus, it has vent holes on the bottom, which not only allow for heat dissipation, but also make really convenient ziptie tie-down locations. I'll definitely be buying more of these."
280,223,4.0,Best price and overall value compared to the name brands.  This product has exceeded expectation and we are intending on buying many many more!
828,223,4.0,Did a ton of research out there b4 I bought this. I can't BELIEVE that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal! What a racket it is. If I could make one I would. This one was cheap and does the job. Dunzos.
415,223,4.0,"A great deal here on Amazon, these cost a lot more a few years ago, it appears Chief bought Raxxess and is now doing the manufacturing. The shelf I received has slots all over it (instead of a bunch of screw holes), this makes it really easy to mount things. I'm ordering more of these, they are thick metal and strong enough to hold heavy gadgets.Good luck and good music to all."
674,223,4.0,"It's a bent piece of metal with conveniently spaced slots and some sort of black coating...powder coat? paint? who knows? it's black.It's heavy enough that it doesn't flex unnecessarily. It has some heft to it, so if you're trying to keep your rack super light be aware of that. The coating is strong. The pre-stamped slots go sideways so that if your gear does come loose, it slips sideways and not forwards, protecting the knobs.I recently had to drill additional holes in one for a homemade piece of gear with totally random mounting hole locations, and it took a while to get through.I like it enough that I bought another one."
882,223,4.0,Very good tray to put small items. I put my KVM switch on it and other server components. I recommend it
726,223,4.0,I like.  Fits well.
1276,161,4.0,These tuning machines are great.They are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intended.I needed the tuners replaced on an Applause (Ovation copy) guitar (the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tune)and a Washburn guitar. They fit on my Washburn and my Applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drill.The tuner hole size is .391 or 25/64 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer (yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like Stewart MacDonald). You may be required to pre-drill for the screws that go through the back of the tuner.It is only one hole and very small.The vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed for.The run around at the post office of getting it re-sent was ridiculous.The vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive.
1094,161,4.0,These things are heavy duty and thick.  The stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things.  Quality devices.
1376,161,4.0,"Put a set of these on my Rogue Grand Concert, now the guitar stays in tune beautifully! Worth every penny!"
301,161,4.0,I placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer. Stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock Ping tuners. This is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed. To those who say it doesnt stay in tune should have their guitar's bridge checked as flaws in the bridge can cause problems in tuning.
517,161,4.0,"I bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my Hondo II ""The Paul"", which I bought in 1980. The stock ones were loose, lots of backlash in the worm gears, and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new.They went in easily, if you follow this hint( if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged, disregard this hint)- The holes for the old machine heads on the Hondo II were 0.305"" in diameter, and these new Grovers need a 0.390"" diameter hole. So I had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes. It's almost impossible to use a drill, even in a drill press, without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock. I read online suggestions about using a round wood file, and reamer, etc.. So what I did was first use a threading tap( for metal screw threads) which at the bottom had a 0.290"" diameter, and at the top had a 0.375"" diameter. This is a standard 3/8""-24 threading tap. I chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill, set to low speed, and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0.375"" in diameter. Then I used a tapered reamer, from both sides, to enlarge the holes to the required diameter. Quick, clean, easy. If you have a different size enlargement to make, use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0.390"" diameter.Another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time, like when changing strings. You don't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod. At least I don't want to!Now the guitar stays in tune, and is easier and more accurate to tune.A very worthwhile upgrade! Zero backlash in the worm gears on the Grovers, beautifully chromed and smooth as silk."
277,161,4.0,Best tuners you can buy.  Can't say much else.  Bought these to replace some gold ones on a Les Paul clone.
671,161,4.0,"I just installed these on my Chibson LP from overseas. I had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger.. I took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards, not forwards, by hand slowly, until it was perfect. I also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case I slipped. Took me about 1.5 hours.The ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance. Really close, but they were terrible in operation. I have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar. Haven't played them yet, but all the reviews were good, so here goes.....Update:  Played for a couple hours. First thing I notice is that they are geared lower than the old Chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars.. You tune it a full turn, and the tune moves up slightly. Which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment.This fixed the Chibson tuning issue. I'll order another set for my other Chibson.Also, I have two Epiphones. I believe these are nicer than the Epi's.So I bought based solely on the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am pretty impressed. good replacement for ""iffy"" tuners. They worked for me..."
1222,678,3.0,"This works better than the QK10B model by the same company.  Slim and easy to install though longer than the QK10B.  Since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts, you might have to rotate a mic boom, etc., to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts.  My use was for an IPad clamp attached to a mic stand.  It worked well and I put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag.  This unit wiggles a little but not as much as the QK10B so the little bit of movement is acceptable.  This looks to be well built and should be reliable. The long haul will be the test."
740,678,4.0,"This is just what the doctor ordered. I bought three and am purchasing 3 more. All of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders. If I switch one mic to another stand, it could not be easier, just a press of a little button. With different shock mounts on different mics, I don't have to worry about re-threading the mounts each time I change mic stands. The time it saves is also invaluable. No problem with quality control on the 3 I now have, and I have no complaint with the build. Great for the studio, where I use mine, would think It would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand, use a clip for that.Addendum:I love these so much, I have bought one for each mic in my locker, and each stand. That's a total of 12. None of them have failed after almost a years worth of use, the best invention for a mic since the shock mount. These will save you time, guaranteed!"
330,678,4.0,I swear by these quick release clips. I can't imagine working without them. I save so much time each time I use a quick release clip instead of unscrewing and re-screwing the original clips. These are a great way to to mix and match multiple clips with multiple stands. The first items I purchased when I started my last job as an Audio Engineer was these. I've got no complaints. They work great every time.
1168,678,4.0,If you are a mobile DJ that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these.  It saves me 5 minutes per event (setup and break down) just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event.
719,129,4.0,"It's a very solidly made stand. Simple to assemble. Perfect for my home studio, holding my 88 key midi controller keyboard. I'm very happy with the purchase and the price was right."
888,129,4.0,I'm using it for my Alesis Q49 MIDI keyboard.  Folds up easy so I can tuck it away.  It may not work with a keyboard smaller than 49 keys.  As you lower it the support spreads out wide.  Good quality.  Adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard.
296,129,4.0,"Great stand, holds my mid sized keyboard up very well.  Not sure how it works for some behemoths but for the basic setup its fine."
1078,129,4.0,This keyboard is pretty dope. I bought this a while back when I bought my Samson 49 key midi keyboard. It's been a little over 2 years and I've used it ever since. I recommend this to anyone buying a keyboard in the future or currently. You can't go wrong with this stand.
663,739,3.0,This guitar strap is very  comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric Yamaha guitar.Very durable and affordable.My only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would.Colors are abit too flashy.
346,739,4.0,"This is a sharp looking strap that looks much nice in person than in the photos here on Amazon.  The strap feels sturdy, and the material is just slippery enough to make moving about easy.  Definitely glad I bought this!"
948,739,4.0,Quality strap that fits tight & secure on my signature Dime and matches the Dean From Hell lightening graphics perfectly.
20,739,3.0,This strap looks better in person than on the computer. It has a nice soft feel and doesn't scratch the neck like the belt straps do and the color goes well with a varity of instrument looks and colors.
752,739,4.0,I bought this with super saver shipping 5-8 days and it came in 3 so I was very happy about that. Also the lightning itself looks awesome and the black in the background is darker in person than in the (low quality) picture. One more thing is that the strap locks on very well by it self (I have a big problem with that because the strap that came with my guitar sucked) But hell this one is amazing. I bought this one for my black fender and I think I'm going to buy a white tribal for my white Ibanez Grg120bdx. Great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price.
419,420,4.0,Awesome quality strings! Love em! Just re-strung my 12 string. It was a hassle but I got it done nicely.
1110,420,4.0,D'Addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price.  Their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and I have yet to find a better buy.
430,420,4.0,Good value
983,420,4.0,I always love to D'Addario strings on my 6 string guitars so I decided to order these for my new 12 string Ovation 245.  They sound great.  Of course guitar strings can be a personal preference.  Over the years I have been experimenting with various makes and  I always seem to return to these.  This does not mean I will not try others.  I surely will continue to experiment.  I am one to change the strings on my guitars on a very regular basis.  I spend my Summer in Canada and Winters in Florida and I can assure you that the climate is much drier in Canada than Florida.  Strings on my guitars left behind in Florida for the Summer will deteriorate quickly even if they are in a humidity controlled environment.  I  find the D'Addario strings will stay in better condition than others.
730,420,4.0,Good strings
68,420,4.0,These strings sound great and so far have held tune well after a couple of days of stretching.  I have them on my Luna 12 string and the sound is rich.  I would purchase them again.
586,19,4.0,"I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics.  No more winding string wraps around the tuning post. Fastest string change ever. Insert string, wind about a half turn, and the string is locked in the tuner. No more slipping out of tune. Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do."
1417,19,4.0,These really are direct replacements for the PRS SE line. Only the machine heads are somewhat smaller. A great product.
1071,19,4.0,"Super nice locking tuners. Used these as a direct drop in replacement for my Paul Reed Smith SE245 and really helped with tuning and stability. The smaller tuner buttons looked a little strange at first, but once installed looks great and works great."
174,19,4.0,"They call these mini tuners, but to me they are just right. Some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho. I installed them on a PRS SE Santana in just a few minutes. They were direct drop ins. To use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks. Then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock, insert the string and then turn the tuning peg. You'll feel it &#34;lock in&#34; then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune. They are really good tuners and I think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer."
86,371,3.0,"I'm happy with this.  Used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr. old 60W Roland Cube Amp (a bass player used the amp and I think it was too much for the speaker -- next time I'll use the PA for the bass player).  Much better sound, perfect fit, etc. Keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey-type sound.  I believe it has those.  Using this for jazz applications and having the Roland around as a second amp."
1097,371,4.0,I built a custom cabinet and installed this baby.  Boy does it crank.  I've tried a couple different heads and they all sound great.  I play mostly clean and this speaker makes the tube tones shine.
257,371,4.0,This speaker has a very clear full range sound. I have it in a '63 Brown Deluxe and am very good with it. .In a way it reminds me a bit of a JBL with the smooth depth and clarity. If I want a little Ray Charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack. Cool speaker and nice addition.
775,371,4.0,"The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker I've ever heard.  Period.This does not mean that it's dull sounding or muffled at least, not if you hearing is still good.  I hesitated quite a bit before I decided to buy it and install it in my Fender Mustang II but my worries were for naught. Incredibly, it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds.  Yet, for overdrive sounds, there is very little fuzziness - just a big full and FAT sound that's articulate without being buzzy.  If you play metal you'll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy, classic rock and jazzy sounds, this is a speaker to seriously consider.  I turned my Mustang II into an open back combo and the Cannabis Rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed.  I had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps, it never got shrill or piercing, just buttery smooth and clear. It's also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db@1W/1M.I don't know how Eminence did it but I love it!"
1341,371,3.0,"To me, the stock 12"" speaker that came with my Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue sounded too brittle. Even if I messed with the presence and EQ knobs it just always accentuated the highs too much for me. I had read reviews on this speaker and decided to pull the trigger and get one. I haven't regretted the purchase.I was hoping the improvement would be the same as when I put a 10"" Ragin Cagin in my Fender Super Champ XD. Wasn't the case. It DID, however, fix the problem I purchased the speaker for. My Blues Deluxe now sounds warmer to me and doesn't have that accentuated high-end that it did before. All in all it was a good upgrade and I'd do it again.~Slick"
276,666,4.0,"I had no problems at all getting a brand new poly pro strap on these. Even if it was too snug, it wouldn't have been hard to work a strap on to these. I don't know why people are saying bad things about this product, If your dealing with guitars there much harder things to do with guitars than getting a snug leather strap onto the locks. Don't listen to the whiners. These are what they need to be."
382,666,4.0,"You can find ""cheaper"" ones, but sometimes the Schallers are same price if not cheaper.  These are the best design of lock in my opinion and will hold up to years of abuse and use.  I've had several sets for 13+ years and use them without hesitation."
997,666,4.0,"I'm never playing another guitar without these locks!After my Custom Telecaster fell. The neck went out of wack, I had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again! That's every musician's nightmare!I immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps. Schaller kept coming up. I looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use.One issue you may run into is the nut running loose. That's not a problem with the scaller locks, it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts (it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is). A drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily."
34,666,4.0,"These are a must-have item. Heretofore, I've been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism. While it's an innovative system that doesn't require any installation, the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things.I installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body -- I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit -- not a big deal at all. These Schallers are exactly what I wanted. 5 stars, and a no-brainer."
207,666,4.0,I have been using these for about 2 years now; I am very happy with these strap locks.  Great product.
212,755,4.0,"I have Schaller Security Strap Locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase Schallers for that one soon. These give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity, the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place. My Larrivee RS-4 came with these and converted me to Schaller."
1321,755,4.0,"Their are two issues with these strap-locks that I have come across.The first issue is with thick straps. I purchased a nice leather Levi's strap (which I love), but their didn't seem to be enough threads on the lock to fit the strap on. I managed to get it to work by thinning the leather of the strap with a vise. Overall it wasn't a huge issue, just a bit annoying.The second issue is actually a very concerning to me. Both of my guitars have begun to randomly unclip themselves from the straps and fallen to the ground. Not good. I think it has something to do with the metal on the locks getting either bent or worn down, whatever it is I don't like having my guitars fall to the floor.I have these on two of my guitars, both of which are very heavy. It's the first thing I do when I purchase an instrument. They're pretty easy to put on the strap and guitar, and they do securely hold the instrument in place, mostly. I've had them on one of my guitars for over ten years, and on the other for over five.I probably won't change to a different set of locks, for fear of stripping the holes on my guitars, but my next guitar will be getting some Dunlop straplocks (http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-Design-Straplok-System-Nickel/dp/B0002CZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1357264576&sr;=8-1&keywords;=straplock)which seem a lot better and more sturdy."
804,755,4.0,"Schaller strap locks keep your guitar in place. They have been around a long time and hold up well with time. I also have used dunlops, which are nice as well, but these seem to be the better product IMHO."
440,755,0.0,"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."
1001,755,4.0,"I've been using the Schaller Strap Locks on my guitars since the 1980's.  They give me a sense of security, knowing that my guitar strap is totally secured to my guitar.  I consider it cheap insurance."
1308,755,4.0,"About ten years ago, I installed strap locks on my first guitar (Fender Stratocaster). They worked well and were easy to install. I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. I had to drill additional holes no two guitars (Gibson SGs).  Ouch.This made me take a second look at Schaller. The components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than Dunlop. It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice.  I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning. I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results."
367,755,4.0,This is my second set of these. I bought the 1st set in the 1980's and I'm still using them on the guitar that they matched. (black hardware). I was impressed with the quality of the 1st set and the 2nd set is just as good. Money well spent.
858,755,4.0,"I have found that everything Schaller make's is Grade A-#1 in My book. Made in Germany ( NOT China ) these locks are fast and secure. I like the way they slide on & off which if Your like Me having to change Guitar's during a show or just at home, the change is smooth and safe. No dropping guitar's around here !!! I have them on all My guitar's."
1353,755,4.0,This is as simple and as reliable as it gets. YOu don't need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt!
602,755,4.0,"Schaller is sort of a household name among guitarists, because they've been making the same product for so long now.  You probably already know what this thing is and what it does.  All my electric guitars are equipped with these."
240,755,4.0,Certainly worth every penny you pay for them... and they do vary in price for sure from dealer to dealer.  But if you have a $2000 plus guitar the last thing you want to do is drop it because of bad strap knobs/pins.  These are great for sure.
363,755,4.0,"These locks are the only ones I use now, they are on all of my guitars and I put them on all I build. I have not had a guitar drop since I started using them, and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached. I have tried the Fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my Schaller equipped straps will not fit them. I will stick with the Schaller in all 3 colors."
48,220,2.0,"I will let you know that I've been using boom stands for 35 years and that I write this so you can make an informed decision. I'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.I see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good. I particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom. It's a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give. The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and I'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it. I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses. The boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand. On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series.9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom StandJust like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at Amazon today I'd probably buy the 9700MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Standor this one,DR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boomor maybe try this oneHosa MSB-521BK Mic Stand with BoomI haven't tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I'd be inclined to give it a try. I think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice. I'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is. Ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately. All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money. $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination. As for the cheap cord clips, just forget them and buy these, they'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent (no leftover duct tape glue).Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping TiesBut understand my position, I've got stands purchased 20 years ago that I can still use and don't feel the lowest price is always the best value, but you're intelligent so you know an $80 stand used for 20 years is $4/year, I use stands almost everyday and I don't think this would last me a year and maybe only months. But if1. You don't care about a telescoping boom and2. You don't plan to adjust it much and3. You use a average weight mic or4. You're alright with replacing the boom when neededThis stand could be fine for you now if you can't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some. I did give it 3 stars but 2 are for the product and 1 is for the price. So I hope all of this helps you with your decision.*I've now purchased and reviewed theOn Stage 9701Band recommend checking it out*"
1372,220,4.0,This stand surprised my. It is lightweight but is still sturdy. I wouldn't venture to use it on the road all the time. But as a backup stand I wouldn't hesitate. I like it much better than my musicians gear stand though if this had a double extendable boon it would be perfect.
1073,220,4.0,"This is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use - it would probably fall apart fairly quick ""on the road"" or if it were adjusted constantly.That being said, it's a great little stand for low duty/home use. I'm using it with a Blue enCORE 100 microphone, which isn't really heavy, but still weighs close to a pound. This stand holds it very sturdily, and with the boom feature, it can be set up in just about any position I would ever need.If you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget, this is a decent stand.And for less than $25 bucks, it's a bargain."
773,220,4.0,Strong metal construed.Legs open to set up easy. Easy to set mic slides in or out up or down.Peaces stay tight.
1243,220,4.0,"Be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy. Other than that,,,,,,,,,an excellent value"
1422,220,4.0,"I was not expecting the Onstage Tripod boom microphone stand to be this good.* The bottom tripod stand is very sturdy and keeps the microphone stand balanced.* The main microphone stand pole is very thick and robust. It is built like a baton.* The arm is adjustable and long. I usually hang my headsets and other cables on this adjustable arm. It can hold quite a bit of weight. I haven't tried it yet, but it holds two of headsets and myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Micwith ease. The adjustable arm also spins 360 degrees.* Smooth movement. When I need to move my attached microphone around, it is a smooth, leveled motion.I love this microphone stand. It stands tall and can telescope up to about 5 feet tall. Very high quality microphone stand. Buy with confidence!"
1006,220,3.0,"This is a pretty good stand for the price, I ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as I prefer the telescoping booms. I have the Dr. Pro telescoping and a samson telscoping, the samson is my favorite (think the model is BT4). For the price this is a good value."
888,220,4.0,Works great and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence.  Great price too.
267,220,4.0,"I bought two of these for my band, and they are fantastic. Granted they are not the Hercules stands that I use, but they work for my two other singers. Great quality, and I would definitely buy them again."
864,220,3.0,I've been buying cheap stands and I'm never really getting what I want. I finally bought this. Nice and solid.
418,220,4.0,"Almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials. Can double as a mic or boom stand. The boom attachment is very easily adjustable but also very sturdy when you lock it down. Wasn't disappointed. The connecting parts of the mic stand/boom are 5/8 inch male size so make sure whatever you're buying this product with can connect to that (my shock mount had 3/8in female connector). If not, just invest (about 6$) into an adapter like I did."
693,220,4.0,"I like mic stands with folding legs (like this) as opposed to weighted bases, since they're easier to travel with.  Quality-wise, this stand feels solid, but not amazing &#8211; it's a mixture of plastic and metal construction.  For the price I paid (around $25), it's a nice piece of kit and everything holds as it should.  It also folds down pretty well.  Note that it does not include any kind of microphone clip or mount, so you'll need to provide your own.  The cable clips are a nice touch."
471,220,4.0,"I really like this stand, I even bought a second one after giving it a try. Is solid, you maybe need to tight too strong to avoind the weight of the mic to bring the arm down, buy, I can do that.Recommended."
325,220,2.0,"i mean, sure they get the job done, but there're 2 things i'm not too convinced about.. first stability, you have to be very very careful as how you distribute the microphone's weight, and be pretty careful not to rotate it even a litlle bit, otherwise, you'll find yourself with a shure sm-58 with a dent, like myself. and second... i haven't had actually any bad experience with this, but don't seem to be that strongly built. for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules."
1216,220,4.0,"Very good stand especially for the price. It is not incredibly stable, but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy."
305,220,3.0,This is a nice microphone stand. I have used it on several projects involving sound with no problems. I would purchase this again. It's sturdy and gets the job done.
1327,220,2.0,"Screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use. The black covering of the metal is starting to show wear. To be expected, but I'm sure you'll appreciate hearing that this is not one of those miracle deals where you get something amazing for the money. It is what it is, and not much more."
872,220,4.0,"Does exactly what you want it to do. It even comes with these little clips for running the cable down the stand. It's easy to set up and easy to take down. If you're looking for a mic stand, buy this one- you really can't go wrong."
158,220,4.0,"i use this one a lot, its light weight and sturdy. it would be nice to have a counter weight for the long reaches, but can work around that detail. its well made"
280,220,4.0,Recommend this to anyone!We have a mobile church which means we need sturdy and inexpensive.  I believe we found our ultimate match with this mic stand.
828,220,4.0,The only flaw is the rubber gaskets in the joints These deteriorate over 3 or 4 years. I go through these quite a bot but for $20-$30 you can't go wrong. Tubes are tough and sturdy
1313,220,4.0,Quite resistant and reliableGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thank you very much
1365,220,3.0,"This seems like a good deal for the price. I have concerns about durability for anyone who has to frequently adjust the boom, or takes it on the road, because that boom-adjustment joint is a bit flimsy. I bought it for home studio use by just me, so I am totally satisfied."
91,220,2.0,"This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is. I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price. I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future. It works fine, just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past."
255,220,4.0,"This stands up and holds the microphone in place.The stand is study, easily adjustable, and withstands the rigours of use."
4,220,1.0,"No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included.  The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item.  There's no instruction (which is fine). But in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I can't because it doesn't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping.  The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip.  But without it, I felt cheated."
1146,220,4.0,"I needed a cheap mic stand that didn't break the bank.  This little guy fit the bill.  I don't know if it could stand up next to the Hercules stands that I have used for years in terms of long-term durability, but for a simple, home-use stand, it is perfect.  It is sturdy, the knobs feel tight and is balanced.  Great entry-level stand!"
525,220,3.0,"Its a little unstable at times, but the fasteners and adjustment areas on this stand do keep the stand in place and such that it can be good for a sound studio or classroom setting, not sure if I would recommend it for professional use, but that's why you spend more for better quality right?"
748,220,3.0,"does really good with a fairly heavy microphone, adjustments stay in place without constantly tightening, works exactly as it should"
516,220,3.0,"This stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands, jammers and home studio owners because I run across them everywhere. And like everyone else I wound up with a few of my own. Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model:- For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped.)- They hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- Good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone. Not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.I lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole. Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's. As for the binding - I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands. Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.For inexpensive stands these are hard to beat. However, I now use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - PA/DJ/Band/Church/Wedding use, which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price. Also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand, Blackto be a far better solution."
1416,220,2.0,"This could be used for lightweight microphones but don't bother wasting your money if you're using a studio microphone. The base has a small circumference, so you can't stick the boom out very far at all, almost useless. There are better deals for just slightly more money. Or if you really want near studio quality, try the Samson studio boom mic stands."
428,220,3.0,"I use this for my home recording studio. This stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle. From playing and singing piano, recording guitar and vocals, and other various positions. Sometimes hard to keep the mic firmly in place but that may be a function of my shock mount.Cheap and highly recommended."
425,220,4.0,I like the stand. It makes my recording convenient. It is well built. The adjustable parts are easy to use.
478,220,3.0,this stand i very good just wish it was a bit heavier for helping it be more stable when using a heavy mic.
49,220,4.0,It's well built enough to stand up to regular use.  I use mine for recording and some performance.  It' works great.
11,220,4.0,"All adjustments keep position well.  About as sturdy as a tripod can be.  Exactly as advertised, no complaints from this user."
457,220,3.0,"When you extend it out all the way, it sometimes topples over due to little weight on the bottom, but other than that, this stand is perfect."
1324,220,4.0,"Good stand, solid components, easily adjustable and the boom is good length.  I gave it too our drummer and he uses regularly without complaint"
1406,220,4.0,"I actually use this stand for more than holding a mic.I use it for video and photo purposes: Holding light reflectors, flagging, speedlights, etc.It's heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo."
1142,220,3.0,"Provides everything I need from a mic stand.  Everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm.  Packs up small.  I knocked off one star because if you look carefully at the stand, it leans ever so slightly.  It is after all a cheap Chinese stand."
431,220,4.0,This stand (it just arrived in the mail) will be durable in the years to come with my music I can tell. Awesome stand and I would recommend to anyone!
23,220,3.0,"Not the best quality in the world, but for the price tag is wasn't half bad! If you're doing something more professional it may wear out overtime, but if it's just for personal use, you should be fine with this product!"
1399,220,4.0,"I cant play real guitars ....... but i did buy this for Rock Band. This is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way. This has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it. I even use it when im drumming. I highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players.  Well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has.  Oh its almost impossible to knock down too, believe me the cats have tried."
332,622,4.0,"For the price, this box works just as well as as any expensive one would. Just put in a 9v battery and it works right away. Three knobs to control tone, level and distortion to get that perfect sound. I do recommend you get a power adapter, because this eats us batteries like crazy. I accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry, batteries are expensive, get the power supply. Overall, this is a good budget buy, you won't need to money for quality with this."
536,622,3.0,"What more can you ask for in a pedal that runs you twelve clams and ships for free?  This is not the highest quality pedal in terms of construction or tones, but it gets the job done nicely for cheap.  If you are just starting to experement with stomp boxes (or you are addicted to collecting stompboxes like yours truely), you can't go wrong with the FAB line.  I find the placement of the knobs just slightly annoying, but it's a nitpick at this price point.  If you are looking for something like the Boss DS-1, this will pretty much cover the bases at less than a quarter of the price of the Boss pedal.  If you are looking for more of a light breakup kind of box on the cheap, get the dano overdrive instead (the silver one).  I also find that for about ten bucks more, Behringer makes some great clone pedals."
682,622,4.0,"Look at the price, because this thing really sounds good. It's no toy, it's a real Retro Electric Guitar Effects Pedal. I'm very happy with  this purchase"
823,622,1.0,"The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE. This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. AVOID."
1203,622,3.0,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-1 Distortion effects pedal works great and gives me that  mind blowing distortion you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is &#34; It tends to be a little noisey &#34;  if you turn the gain up too much.  You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have.  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but thats my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
911,622,3.0,"Great little pedal, economical and worked flawlessly.  It didn't have a power supply or battery included, for a low price what do you expect?  Besides batteries aren't that expensive.  Cranked out a nice distortion for my Fender guitar.  Great product."
275,622,3.0,"Musicfriends, This is a fab item - For 20.00 You can't go wrong on this. Warm distortion and good controls. For me great studio/recording use but thats it. I would certainly not tour with it... its built cheap w. plastic housing and one circuit board squeezed in and funny enough the one piece rugged metal... is the bottom plate. Hello designers.... Metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must. But anyways, bottom line great unit for 20.00 and sounds good very versatile."
114,622,4.0,"I was looking for a pedal that didn't take my life's savings and still performed well. I found it right here, it  works well with no problems to report. next week I'll purchase another (with a different feature). It also arrived super fast."
638,622,3.0,"This delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion, but a nice bit of fuzz.  I'm impressed with what you get for the price!"
1017,622,2.0,"I love a lot of Danelectro products, but not really this one, i give it 3/5 because it works as advertised.The features are good. True Bypass requires a 9v wall plug, and adjustments are good.BUT HERE'S MY ISSUE- The Distortion is not 'Crunchy.' It distorts, sure, but the sound is not dimensional... it has no depth to it.Thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres, but i play a lot of blues-rock... I ended up switching to a Vintage-Tube overdrive by behringer.Not for me, maybe for you."
834,778,2.0,"It's not bad. It would be better if I bought one large enough for my finger. Still, I'd rather stick with a Copper slide."
1321,778,1.0,"I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out."
102,778,2.0,"A little small for my taste, very thin, but works well and Dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician."
541,778,3.0,"This is a great glass slide, but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced. My finger stays too tight. Not uncomfortable, but it takes some effort to get it out."
250,778,2.0,"Clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio. I did drop it a couple times (ok, maybe more than a couple) on the wood floors of stages without a problem. Then one day, in the frigidly cold outdoors, I dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered, oops."
446,778,3.0,"I'll start this by saying I prefer metal slides to glass (tone snob that I am)So I wasn't too excited about playing with this, until I played with it!The tone is amazing!!Great highs, amazing lows, smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics!I now only use metal slides... And my dunlop bottleneck ;-)"
779,374,4.0,"This strap works well, looks good, and is comfortable to wear. The choice of colors and durable material are two strengths. Price was good for a useful accessory."
840,374,4.0,Nice basic guitar strap.. Great price and should last long enough.  I have started using the padded Levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap. This can be a little scratchy
398,374,4.0,"No sign of wear and tear. and the holes are really tight, minimizing the likelihood of the guitar breaking free occasionally (it never once came undone in all these months, not sth you can say about all guitar straps)"
860,374,4.0,"This was my first strap. It looks good, feels pretty strong, and it is difficult to strap to the guitar. By being difficult, I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons, and it holds on tight. This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground. You can't beat the price either!"
391,374,4.0,they don't cost a lot and they work well.  They are inexpensive and they work.  I have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice
705,545,4.0,They say there the best there not wrong wool awesome good buy
961,545,4.0,Great cord for the money. Works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for Christmas. Will buy more in future
264,545,4.0,I highly recommend planet waves cables!  I have them for my guitars and for my mics . awesome sound great durability and reliability and warranty for life!! cant go wrong !
902,545,4.0,"I've been using this mic cable for over ten years, and it had come up missing after an event. I looked everywhere I could think of, and thought I had lost it for good. One day, I happened to look between a ball of TV cable wire in the rehearsal room, and there it was. I didn't remember where I'd gotten it, or even the manufacturer. Although I have more than a dozen mic cables, this pliable cable, with it's own elastic clasp, was always my favorite.  I was ecstatic the day I found it, after months without it, and now have a backup. I highly recommend this cable."
280,545,4.0,So far so good! And I know if anything goes wrong I just have to return it to a local dealer.  Well worth the investment!
991,713,4.0,"If you want a little more &#34;meaty&#34; sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars, this set is the ticket.Just slightly heavier feel but much more tone.As usual, after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension."
1132,713,3.0,Good strings.  They work and sound good.  I didn't notice much of a difference between these and run-of-the-mill D'Addario strings.
92,713,3.0,"If you want an inexpensive ""pure nickel"" string get theDR Strings Pure Blues Pure Nickel Wrap Round Core.They feel nice, are nicer to your frets, sound smooth and mellow for the blues or any genre. They bendnicely and sustain just as well.I know guitar strings can be a personal thing, and there are more expensive pure nickels out there, butat this price point try a set of these as well. You may be surprised.I have rated this set at '4' stars because only after about 16 hours of practice the 'D' string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my Gibson Standard. No damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull, almost dead. Strange.I recently went 'electric' again after 20+ years. So electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again. That said, I never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over 30years  of playing.I put another set on my electric and have had no further problems. I have not heard of this happeningto anyone else. Maybe its no big deal, so no one remarks on it...UPDATE 07/14/2013: I am still using DR Blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthem..UPDATE 01/08/2014: I just had the D string windings break on a new set. Different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above."
356,713,4.0,I did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these.  I just got done stringing them and they sound great. I think these will be what I play from now on.
726,713,2.0,I didn't know how Pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps.  I was origianlly disappointed in the sound.
218,893,4.0,"While ordering a guitar case, the guitar strap popped up and I could not pass up the deal.  I found it price inexpensive and the quality was very good."
1260,893,4.0,"Works and it is good.No problem, very standard one. All your own preferences. So you need to try it out before you say if that works for you."
1072,893,4.0,"Arrived on time and as described.  The strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come.  It is basic and not fancy.  It does the job, is comfortable and the price is right.  I have four of these Pro Tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years.  This one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea.  So far forget to use it but that will come."
656,893,4.0,"A strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? It was about $5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine. It's comfortable and fits my bass well. I'm a bigger guy and have plenty of length if I needed it. Nice value."
585,893,4.0,I have a collection of straps but not a black one.  This one matches the acoustic/electric I bought perfectly.  The pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have.  I would buy fromthis company again.  Thank You.
312,893,3.0,"Bought this for my Kona K2 acoustic, it fits and holds well on the guitar with the leather ends. Its adjustable with a pick pocket, Simple, good quality, would by another."
1287,893,4.0,"Bought this strap for use with my Dean EVO electric. It's very nice and durable, though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavy-duty. It works great, though, and for the price it's wonderful."
1402,893,3.0,"While on the surface the pocket sounds great, the picks either fall out because they aren't pushed in far enough or they are impossible to grab because they are pushed in too far. There is also a tendency for the picks to fall out when you put the guitar on a stand, which is a bit annoying.The strap itself is just fine and is a good price, but the pocket idea sounded better on paper than it works in real life."
449,893,3.0,I really like the idea of a &#34;Pick&#34; pocket in the strap. In fact I like it so well.... that when I replace the strap on my other guitar I'll make sure it also has the same type of strap.
1307,893,2.0,"&#34;Nice for the price&#34; ... practical, everyday useable. Money well spent on this one for sure. Glad I did it."
246,893,4.0,Fine product!i've been using it for 1 monthno dirty thread or any issue with itleather is bit tough at first time
997,893,0.0,"Cheap crappy strap. It's too stiff, not comfortable at all. I regret purchasing this... Save your money, go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar. They are expensive but worth it."
332,893,4.0,"I needed a new bass strap because my old one was frying at the ends. I choose this one because it was very durable. The nylon is very strong, I do not see it fraying in the future. The leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs. The guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand. Good colour selection too. Highly recommended!"
594,893,4.0,My son was very happy with this guitar strap.  He is just developing good techniques in playing and the comfort of this strap works well.
534,893,3.0,"This works perfect with the quick release system I also purchased. I mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap. It also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare, or want to put it away without loosing it."
140,893,4.0,Very pleasantly surprised buy this one.  I like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put.  It looks like it will hold up to some abuse as well.  A nice strap for my lower tier guitars.
1272,893,4.0,This is a very secure and almost comfortable. There should be a pick pocket on both ends but it is a nice feature.
750,893,3.0,It's well made and is fine as straps go but the pick pocket isn't much use. The picture implies that it hold the pick so that it's partially exposed and easy to grab. However the pocket is bigger that this and fairly loose so that picks tend to fall out when taking the strap off.
1182,893,4.0,I am pleased with this guitar strap and feel it will do great for the young musician in our home.
326,893,3.0,"The only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy. Also the holes are a little hard to hook, in the beginning."
498,893,2.0,"Simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end.  Appropiately priced.  Good value.  Not fancy, but who needs a fancy strap for a $90 guitar?  Arrived before projected delivery date. The leather ends are VERY stiff and VERY difficult to use.  Takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar."
1172,893,2.0,"Well, here's what i have to say, this strap is much shorter than im used to, but seeing how I bought this for an off guitar, that's ok. They really should put the length in the description, the length is 53"" max, where I like my straps to be 64"" max.It is a hard strap to get on the guitar, (I do not suggest getting this strap withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Nickel), these are great locks, BUT almost impossible to install on this strap.Overall great buy for a cheap little money saver."
781,893,4.0,Best strap available for the price. Excellent quality and is very comfy.Love the pick pocket. I will be buying more
1228,893,3.0,Nice strap for the price. Looks nice and quality seems nice. Like the pic holder on front. of the strap.
595,893,4.0,"Well executed black guitar strap.  It is made of strong, seatbelt-like material with excellent stitching that is unlikely to ever fray or come apart.  The length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children.  It has excellent leather ends with slots cut into the leather to put over you guitar buttons (not-included).  Nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively."
873,893,4.0,"i ordered with my new guitar. These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here."
649,893,2.0,"This guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck.  Also, the &#34;pick pocket&#34; is only useful when the strap is around your neck.  When you remove the strap, any picks in the pocket fall out.  It is OK, definitely not great."
95,893,4.0,"Nothing fancy about this strap, unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end. Just well made and functional.I got this for my grandson's Squier (by Fender) 3/4 size acoustic. It doesn't have a strap button at the top end. It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut. But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand."
198,893,4.0,"So, you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing.  This strap is perfect, even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.The materials are 1)high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ACE bandage, 2) durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3) a thick rubber material for the ends.The thickness of  rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well. They do not slide of the strap pegs very easily. I say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility. Again this material seems to be non-marring.All this and a secret compartment for picks.Overall, a fantastic product with a price that can't be beat.  Highly recommended.  Five stars."
463,893,4.0,"this is a nice strap. It's kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because it's stiff. That turned out to be good  good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat, it would  be sad if your axe fell in your soup!"
1317,893,4.0,This strap is a great strap. It is comfortable. It is adjustable. It just looks great. I have not used the pick holder yet.
1314,893,4.0,"Very nice quality, inexpensive guitar strap. A little tough to get on.... that just means it's not going to come off with use, just make sure it is all the way on before you start using it! Using this on my Ibanez ART100 electric guitar. The pick pocket is a nice extra."
430,893,4.0,"Very good strap, but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely. Especially when you take off the guitar for a break. Either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is needed"
242,893,4.0,"I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments.  These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here.  These are also a nice medium width, so they should be suitable for all kinds of players.  Although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons, I actually find the snug fit to be an advantage:  it doesn't feel like I'll have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar.  And, the price is right."
606,893,4.0,It's a guitar strap. It holds up the guitar. Using it on an acoustic dreadnought and it's plenty long enough.
1007,893,4.0,"Great idea, well made, nice heavy webbingFit probly 6 or more picks. No need to glue/screw junk on your axe, maybe good with slide, or capo, haven't tried. But good product and price."
1303,893,3.0,"If you just need an inexpensive strap that is perfectly functional at a low price then this is the one for you.  Works fine, no problems."
627,893,4.0,"Made of durable nylon with pick pocket. Given 5 stars, Shipped on time and at good price. I recommend this item."
93,893,2.0,"There are other guitar straps that are nearly the same quality for half the price. The thing about this one is that it has a pocket to hold a few picks, which is quite useful. I also like the leather ends, because they dont shift and move around quite as much as my old plastic-ey one did. Overall, i think these are abit much for seven dollars, but im happy with the purchase."
958,893,4.0,"This was a great strap, i used it on my guitar for months and it's so strong that it's tough to take off, i'm buying another one for my bass"
1152,893,3.0,What can I say about a guitar strap.  It fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price.
768,893,4.0,Very comfortable. The soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish. Heavy duty but soft on the shoulder. Not cheap quality at all. This will definitely last a long time.
200,893,4.0,Cheaply made but functional. Keep a couple of these in the bag as spares.They will be handy if you- know- who shows up to the gig without a strap.
697,893,3.0,"I have enjoyed my Protec Strap. I was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and I have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my Dot Studio. One note would be that these straps are probably better for your lighter body styles - strats, teles, sgs - heavier guitars will tend to start digging into your shoulder after an hour or so. Having the pick pocket is a neat feature. I am just finishing up rebuilding a LP copy and I will be getting another for this guitar net week."
1069,893,2.0,"This isn't the best strap, but it's affordable and pretty good for a beginner's guitar strap. The pick holder on the strap is pretty neat, however I don't find myself using it often. The guitar strap is not very comfortable, but it does the job. Recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar. Don't forget to buy strap locks, you will need it."
1393,893,4.0,These are really well made straps for the money! The only problem I had was that I wished I had ordered more of them!!!!
391,893,4.0,they are cheap to buy and they are nice straps for an acoustic.  I am not sure how they would feel on a heavy electric
1039,893,4.0,"Very good guitar strap!  Thick nylon webbing material well sewn and the leather ends not only look sharp, they hold really well on your guitar studs.The tan color goes with with my natural finished guitar.I would recommend this strap to all!"
763,893,3.0,"I order 2 of these for my electric guitars.  They are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range.  The end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff ""pleather"" knock off. They were VERY difficult to get on my guitar pegs (not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure).  These are not coming off anytime soon.  They are wide enough but do not have any kind of shoulder pad (I play sitting down so no big deal to me- but if you play standing up these won't be the most comfortable straps) All in all they are a decent strap for the price."
124,893,4.0,"I really like this strap, it's comfortable, adjusts easily, and the pick holder is really convenient.  This is my second one for my other guitar."
1215,893,4.0,"This strap is sturdy and looks good and goes well with a Fender Strat, it doesn't come off every time you get to jamming out and forget you are not sitting down, so you don't have to worry about dropping your guitar so you can focus on rocking out."
1264,893,4.0,These straps are very good at a low cost. I actually like them better than a few high-priced straps I have and they&#8217;re lightweight as well.
792,893,4.0,This strap is very well made.  The leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar.  Very happy with this low cost strap.
926,893,3.0,"Looks like the ends will hold up without having to use strap locks. The pick pocket is cool, though I won't be using it."
268,893,4.0,for the price u cant go wrong. its long enough .. and well made.. it got here fast and was trackable.. slap and tap an dont forget ur strap.
375,499,4.0,i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar...but all in all I will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort! It looks and feels great on my Luna Butterfly...and I like the durability it seems like it will have. Pretty great strap overall and I am very very much pleased with my purchase!!! all smiles here :)
840,499,4.0,Very nice strap.  is comfortable as this type of strap can be..  it will with heavier guitars feel like its wearing on you after about an hour.  I ended up switching to their padded strap.  I still think this is a great strap and use it on a lighter guitar now.
1356,499,4.0,"I really like this strap.  I ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so I can have one on each guitar.  They're really comfortable.  They're much less bulky than most of the leather straps I've seen, so I can just keep them on the guitar in the case.I've had the original blue one I bought for about 3 years and it still looks and functions like new."
983,499,4.0,I love my Levy's Jacquard Straps.  They are colourful.  I have purchase 2 to see how they were.  This one to match with my black Ovation 1861- Balladeer and another to match with my Ovation Maple top CC44.  I now have another one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 just ordered this week from Amazon.The straps were chosen to match with the guitar colours and my wife thinks that they are awesome and will certainly be talked about by the ladies around when I play my guitars.They tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders.  I have no regrets with the purchases and I truly recommend those straps to anyone.
1332,499,4.0,I just ordered three different guitar straps online. One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself. Then I found this and decided to get it. The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff. I got this and switched over. Ahhh this is a guitar strap! I see why you pay more. It is so soft and comfortable. It looks AMAZING! This is just a great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar. Thanks!
754,499,4.0,"This strap is very thick and heavy, which give you a good secure feeling.  The heavy leather ends are difficult to get the buttons on the guitar through, but your know that they are not going to slip back out.The picture does not do it justice. I paired it with my black EPI LP and it looks phenomenal. I am very impressed with how nice this strap is."
445,499,4.0,"I have several of these straps in different colors and I've never been disappointed.  It holds my 11 pound Les Paul with no problems and the first one I bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong.  If you like the design, go for it!"
90,499,4.0,"The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well. The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud. Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear). Easy to adjust, comfortable. I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get."
608,451,4.0,"I installed the Ragin' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ X2. I immediately noticed a difference in the quality, fullness and volume of my amp. It has turned my amp into a amp that is now capable of being used at small gigs. An excellent speaker that I would highly recommed."
550,451,4.0,"I installed the Ragin' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ XD.  I read all of the reviews of people saying this speaker turned their Super Champ into a monster and man they were right!  I immediately noticed a difference in the warmth, articulation, and fullness of my sound!  The cleans are warm and...clean, and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely.  I had been trying to play Tool's ""Jambi"" and the beginning part never sounded right.  I always thought I was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned.  Tried the same lick with the Ragin Cajun and it sounds perfect!  I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone that owns a Fender Super Camp XD or needs a 10 inch speaker.Two items of note:  1) A few people said this is a bass heavy speaker and I do not agree.  While it is slightly darker than the stock speaker, it has a screaming Mid/Low range.  A quick turn of the Treble knob from 4 to 6 cleaned up the darkness.  2) Don't forget, the first time you install the speaker will be the worst it will sound.  All speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot.  With that said, this thing sounds amazing directly after install.  Buy, you won't regret!"
372,451,4.0,"Fabulous clean tone, and great distortion sound running off a solid-state amp and pedals. The characteristic Strat sound of my guitar is very apparent. Weighs a ton, cool logo, made in USA. What more could you ask?"
389,451,3.0,"I installed this in a Super Champ x2.  As others have pointed out you'll have to turn the treble down after installing it.  That's because it's designed for making solos stand out. I.e., for adding punch.  If you're a lead guitarist, this speaker will make your guitar sing.However, if you mostly play rhythm, I'd stick with the stock speaker.I want to put two of these into my 4x10 Blues DeVille to increase its range and make solos sing, while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom."
930,451,4.0,If you play Rock or Classic Rock & have a Tube amp with a 10 Inch speaker that needs a little more life... Pop one of these in. My little  VHT Special 6 Came Alive with this speaker. Love It!
1341,451,4.0,"Simply put, this speaker turned my Super Champ XD into a killer 15watt amp. Gave the amp more low-end and made everything much clearer. I would, and do, recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their Super Champ sound. And, like other people have said, the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting. I had to turn the amp down two notches (two number) to have the same volume level out of the amp.If my Super Champ was stolen, I'd buy a new one and put this speaker in it. Wouldn't even think twice about it."
974,451,4.0,"I bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my Fender x2 champ. It has much more weight to it and a way larger, heavier magnet. It has way more bass and is louder than the stock Fender.It sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby.  This one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings. Great replacement and a definite upgrade. Makes the champ a SUPER CHAMP."
1134,447,4.0,"I purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig.I am a bass player by trade, though I dabble with many other instrument (as many of us do). I typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows, when the sound system is adequate, via SansAmp ParaDriver or VT Bass Deluxe DI.Around my modest home studio I often need an XLR to run just a few feet from my DI to my interface so the AT cable works well there. For being a thin flexible cable, I notice no noise issues or interference problems.I also sing backups on stage and I typically run my mic into a TC Electronics Mic Mechanic pedal, (which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals) and then to the mixer. I use the AT 10' XLR to run from the Mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show, then I run the standard XLR to mixer or stage snake out of the TC.The cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment, unlike many of my other cheaper XLR cables. This cable, at least in its 10' form, sounds just as good as my Mogami Silver 25' XLR. I know that many cheaply priced XLRs are noisy and problematic. I have several. I don't have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my Mogami cables.On short, I would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike."
34,338,4.0,"While I wish the bases came in different colors, I really like these hangars. They look good, and perform well. I hang Strats on them and have not experienced any problems (think I saw a video on Youtube that said Strat headstocks could slip).Easy to install, and hanging and releasing is a no-brainer. Have three of these Hercules hangers."
1028,338,4.0,"Used these for years on son's electric guitars. No fuss. Mechanics do not seems to wear out, still gripping. No way at all to knock the guitar off the wall. No neck damage to axes. Mounts well, but try to find a stud, certainly. Keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall.No complaints. If you're going to drill your wall, is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers. All 5 star reviews on this baby. And I agree, and I add to that total.  5 stars"
95,338,4.0,"I was first exposed to the Hercules locking mechanism when our Praise Band leader brought in his Hercules two-guitar stand and I tried it with both my full-size 12-string guitar and my 5-string banjo. I was impressed. When I decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room/amateur studio, I was excited to find that the same Hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall-hanger models. I put them on my wish list, where my son & daughter-in-law found them and bought three for me for Christmas this last weekend. I just finished putting them up and I'm completely satisfied with their solid construction. They give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably. I used the provided screws, which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls. I probably wouldn't trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall, but instead get something more substantial to mount it (like a toggle anchor).What I'm happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments. The opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and 12-string guitars but not so wide as to not support my 5-string banjo. (I've submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical & 12-string guitars, and 5-string banjo). My friend plays Gretch semi-hollow body and Fender solid-body (and other) electric guitars with his Hercules 2-guitar stand, so I assume they would also work with the wall hangers.I am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy."
422,338,4.0,"fits just fine,I have two electric guitars and one bass, nothing can take it down ,you will see it recommended !"
183,338,4.0,Very nice design. It can holds all the my guitars with no issues.  The lock system is amazing and keeps my guitars well secured.
1335,338,4.0,This clip does the same thing that the Hercules guitar stands do: Lock your guitar in place so you don't have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger. The auto-close function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger. Simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime.
1080,338,4.0,I purchase this Hercules GSP38WB A/G guitar hanger for my Yamaha 700. Is just perfect for what is made for. 100% satisfaction.
1341,338,3.0,"I have purchased six of these over the last couple years. Why? Because they work. They mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place. I don't think I'd ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall. They feel rock-solid too.I highly recommend and will be buying more in the future.I gave it 4/5 stars because I haven't used any other devices like these before - maybe there is something better, but I haven't seen it yet.~Slick"
747,438,4.0,"I had purchased a Peak violin stand but wasn't thrilled with the height of the violin bow holder -- the tip of the bow dangled just a bit too close to the floor for my comfort.  This, being designed to hold either a violin or a viola, allows more height and I feel that the bow is safer.  Additionally, this stand allows my violin to be placed on it with the shoulder rest in place while the Peak stand was less secure unless I removed the shoulder rest.  So this stand is more versatile for a performing situation and for days at home when I want to have my violin handy and ready to play as time allows.Warning -- do not use any violin stand at all if you have a cat or dog which can come into the room where the violin is resting on the stand.  The stand does have a lock to help keep the violin on the stand but it would be very easy to knock the whole thing over if a dog or cat were in a playful energetic mood."
370,726,4.0,I do need a boom to keep the mic. stand away from my guitar when I'm playing and singing. This Posi-Lok Mini-Boom is a nice clean look and is very functional. On Stage has a well built unit here. I have ordered several! Highly recommended. Best price I have found is at Amazon.
1402,726,4.0,"I was concerned when I bought this that my microphone stand would be prone to tipping over since there isn't a counterweight. However, not only does this thing lock in tight and not slowly tip down like other boom stands I've used in the past, but it hasn't tipped over yet after quite a bit of use."
864,726,3.0,"It's a short boom, but it works great. I really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening."
810,726,4.0,"I use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic (a cheap SM58 wannabe from Radio Shack). I like how I can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use, but then I can  easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach. Definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk, but a clamping mount works very well. The locking clutch is excellent, with a large nob and secure teeth. The smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient. Just what I needed."
1366,726,4.0,"When this product appeared to be defective I contacted the seller. While they agreed to an exchange they did say that I was liable for up to 5.81 in shipping costs. I thought that more than 25% of the item's cost was a bit much.I decided to conatct the ON STAGE people directly. Not only did they seem genuinely cocerned about their product living up to their standadrs they patiently and politely guided me through the proper set-up, determined that the item was defective and then pronmised me a replacement without having to return the defective item, a microphone boom. I had the replacemnt in about four days.I have been using ON STAGE instrument and microphone stands for several years now. They are extremely well manufactured, they look great and are sturdy as heck. And I am extremely greatful to the compnay for the way they handled my issue.I have rarely been so satisfied with the way an issue was resolved and at the same extremely satisfied with the product as well.On Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone StandSquier by Fender Affinity Telecaster, Butterscotch BlondeShure SE115-CL Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)Mini 3.5mm Flexible Microphone for PC/Laptop/Skype"
924,726,4.0,This mini telescoping boom is the bomb! It is built very well with long lasting parts. It looks very professional and works without any problems. It fit perfect on my new Hercules mic stand and was ready to go. It holds your condenser mic very solid for a worry-free session. Especially if you have an expensive heavy mic you want to protect without any question of durability. I'd say it it worth every penny if you prefer quality equipment in your studio. This one is definitely a hit!
159,448,4.0,I was looking for a thin crash on a budget and I gave this company a try and I couldnt be more happy..I had reservations at first but when I installed it on my set and used it today I was very surprised.. It hasa great hissing crash that lingers a bit as a much more expensive cymbal would have.  This companyputs out a good cymbal and I have a combination of all of the top line names on my set.
739,448,4.0,"It's made from China, but very please for me, sound so warm and vibration much better than famous brand. Will buy again with other size. Which 6 stars."
545,448,4.0,"this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all 9 cymbals that I possess and use. very brilliant and resonant, definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price. trust this cymbal once and you won't be disappointed. it lasts a pretty long while too. it's a thin splash so it does tend to break after about 8 months of use er so, but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there. all in all I definitely recommend trying this product"
1214,448,3.0,"Wuhan makes great products for the money. I have the 18&#34; medium crash and so I decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck. If you close your eyes you would swear you were using a Zylgian from the 60's or 70's. Nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals,  With any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 Wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash. Will review each one as they come in from Amazon. Why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like I am, go for Wuhans. I have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash. Wuhan really impresses me. There are some great video's of Wuhans on You Tube, you should really check those out before buying Wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter. I am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash!"
1048,448,4.0,"Nice cymbal, better price . I'm no Metallurgist but this cymbal seems to compare with the more expensive ones without the high price tag ."
317,169,0.0,"My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps.  I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  These harps have no volume.  Don't waste your money on them.  I guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle, well I take that back.  There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat.  I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it.  With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside."
970,169,4.0,"I'm a total beginner so I don't really know if my review will be useful.  I have nothing to compare these too except my Lee Oskar.  They sound good to me...that's what's most important right?  These do have a kind of nasty &#34;new car smell&#34; to them, but I'm leaving the box open to see if airing them out helps.  It's not a big deal, but it's the only negative I can find with them.  Rock on bro!"
173,169,4.0,"I purchase a set of these, and first off, the case itself is worth 10 dollars. It is a quality heavy cloth case with a felt/velvet lining. The harmonicas are almost unbearable to play as soon as they arrive as they reek like plastic and oil, but after leaving the case open 2 days, they barely smell, and they are still airing out. I love how light they are due to the plastic cases, even if they aren't super loud. They are a great buy for the money, as I simply wanted a cheap set to mess around with and try out different keys. The notes are slightly difficult to bend, but the reeds are still loosening up. All the notes play but a few of the higher ones needed a little encouragement with overblowing and lightly breaking them in a little, but the harps all sound great after 5 mins of break in. I am quite happy with the product, and they honestly could be much worse for the price. The blues and set is only 10 dollars more with metal casings and probably better components, but these were good too. I would recommend to anyone who has a decent harmonica in C but wants to experiment with other keys... Good buy"
973,169,4.0,All these harmonicas in one case and they sound great. You have to get use to the plastic but it is very easy to do and once you do get ready to play away. Nice tone and fun.
1301,169,2.0,"The C has the same numbered base plate top and bottom, so the numbers are totally opposite on each side. I see what people mean about the taste, but that's hardly a problem as I knew what I was purchasing. Overall, reasonably satisfied, will give them a good try later."
933,169,3.0,"Hohner Marine Band, Hohner Special 20 and Lee Oskar Major Diatonic harps fit well in this case. Hohner's Big River Harp does NOT fit properly in the case - it is longer than the others, and doesn't snug in.  I'll either return the case or order two Lee Oskars to replace my two Big River models. Or, I can just deal with the fact that they don't fit quite properly, but probably ""good enough"". Decisions, decisions.Haven't played the toy harps yet, first things first. I bought the case for the case, not for the included harps."
1188,169,4.0,"Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos."
1002,169,1.0,"I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
701,892,2.0,I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright.  The heavier bass strings didn't really add the bassy sound I was hoping for just more of a thud.  YMMV.
556,892,3.0,Clean and clear sound. Great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking. I prefer a string with a little more volume.  They tune well and hold a tune well.
1005,892,3.0,"I usually use ""extra-lights"" because my fingers are wimps, I like the bottom E to go down to a small .010. I have heard though, that you get more oomph, bass, and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings; so I decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead. Also, I finally bought my first Martin (Woo Hoo!) and researched strings for it, and I read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz, and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the ""Light- Mediums"" were a happy medium and a good balance.When I got my Martin D15 M, I cleaned it up, and then restrung it with a set of these ""Light -Mediums"". At first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast; but that is because I am adding .025 width to the E string (.010 to .0125) ouch!  I  just have to build up my callouses, which will take a few weeks of torture, ugh. But, the sound is AWESOME. Part of it is the Martin guitar of course, but these strings, when I hit the G chord, ring out with a deep, warm and long-sustaining bass thump. You feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings, the 6th, 5th and 4th.  The treble strings bend pretty easily. No buzzing. They have no coating , so they SQUEAK like hell. (TIP: I put a molecule or 2 of hand lotion on my fingertips 15 minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down) These strings are great, I recommend them. I will try and update my review 3 months from now and let you know about their longevity, etc."
73,892,3.0,"Tried these on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are basic standard traditional strings. They sound good, they are light weight. On this guitar they sound a bit too bright. My preference is to use Elixirs, prefer the feel and sound on this guitar (Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings (Light)).These strings do not last less time than the Elixirs. Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar. Some people like a brand new set before every gig, others will go weeks or months before changing. If you are an every gig person, well the Martin set is probably perfect for you - they are much less expensive than others. Leaving strings in for an extended period - Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea.There is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar. The choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play. I think the Martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style. So for the price, these are an excellent value."
349,892,0.0,"Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again."
1303,892,3.0,"I would definitely buy these strings again.  They are high quality, great durablity and a great price.  The Martin name is synonymous with quality."
298,892,4.0,"I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights. They give off such a warm tone, and are holding up very well."
259,892,3.0,"After reading all the great reviews, I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge. They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge. However, I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy. Finger slides are much harder with these strings. The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. As a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until I've slid those areas a couple of times. That's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them. The packaging was also a bit confusing. Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up. Other string makers I have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up. Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again."
493,892,4.0,"By definition, medium is an in between size. But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be.If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium. If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening. With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste."
1215,892,4.0,"love these strings, but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball, they just sound better, bend easier and have a longer life span, but Martin are very good too, I just prefer Ernie Ball, but they were sold out and I needed strings fast."
976,841,4.0,these are the best strings around.  last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern.
98,841,4.0,I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating.
500,841,4.0,"They're 2 days on and sound fantastic already. I've come to expect nothing but excellence from Elixirs, they're the best I've played on to date, whether electric or acoustic. I very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box"
328,841,4.0,"Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used, they sound great and last far longer (tonally) than anything else I have tried....."
649,841,4.0,"I only play Elixir strings.  They are relatively finger friendly, hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings I have played in the past.  These were for an electric acoustic I just bought, which is why I got a lighter string than I normally play.  I will move to mediums once I get the feel of the guitar.  Of course, they will be Elixirs as well."
242,841,4.0,"Elixir's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings I've ever used on my Alvarez acoustic -- a guitar I've now owned for over 30 years.  They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers.  Unlike the Elixir Extra Lights that I found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short-scale guitar, these seem like an ideal combination.  I may buy another set soon and restring the short-scale instrument with lights.  Compared with some brands and gauges of more ""old school"" strings, there may be a little less bass response, but these sound good, pretty even through the set, and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string."
983,841,3.0,"You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings.  Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another.  However, you cannot go wrong with those strings.  I highly recommend them.  I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried."
1150,841,4.0,This is the only brand I would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play. These are well worth the money!
85,841,4.0,I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try..
1278,841,4.0,"I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings.  But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day.  A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended."
1196,841,4.0,"You can never go wrong with Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating, 6-String,...The great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost."
201,841,2.0,These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit.
1045,841,4.0,"they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great, these strings are not focused on performance but endurance, best string I've ever played!"
1360,841,4.0,I absolutely love these strings. They enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought. They last a long time and they keep their great sound for a long time. If there was a way to give 10 stars I would.
496,841,4.0,"Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings."
502,841,4.0,"I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are super smooth. It's like playing a silk guitar. Get these strings."
248,841,4.0,These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!
683,841,4.0,"Very good string!! I've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now. I've been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more month's. Within these ten years I've only had 2 strings break on me, and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time"
684,841,3.0,"I have never been much of a fan for coated strings. I normally use DAddario EJ 16's but I do like these Elixirs, after about 4 weeks of playing they are starting to fade, not stay in tune and I notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole. They do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround"
1412,779,0.0,"I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication."
873,779,4.0,A friend of my has one and I just found in love with it. Great sound! Beautiful color! The Applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified.
673,779,4.0,No Doubt.... It's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should. First impression of the guitar was terrible. I took it out of the box and started to play. The neck had a huge bow in it. The truss rod was completely loose. I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable. I'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come. If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going. Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised. The guitar sounded pretty good. The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric. Action was good. Upper fret access is really good. The guitar stays in tune while playing. Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises. The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch. I expected red paint. I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting. They are a little small. $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer. If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers.
1047,779,4.0,"This instrument might actually be in a class of its own. That is, it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality; not only with regard to craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces. The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer. Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design. The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible, or playable, to even the most novice of musicians. This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician, simply because it is cost efficient, durable, and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere. Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action, sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel. This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument."
75,196,4.0,"These strings fit the Bill perfectly for ""MY"" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been ""Doctored"" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut. When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............These are great!!!!"
1278,196,4.0,"WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic.  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers."
745,196,4.0,"These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me."
240,196,2.0,Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok.  Will need to check them next week or so.
566,196,4.0,"Strings on my accoustic were old, probably corroded.  It was time to replace all with frest strings.  These are great, did the job."
6,261,4.0,"In my house alone we have a bass player, a acoustic guitar player, a sax player and a violinist, that is not counting myself (I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica, usually I fail) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history, I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice, the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty.just be sure to buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing."
1257,261,4.0,"I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning.The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it.I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card."
373,261,3.0,"I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome.  I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion. Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more.  However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes.  For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices."
843,261,4.0,"I've owned this and a couple of other Korge Tuners in the past, and currently own three.In the past I would use a keyboard to get the bottom E on my guitar and take it from there. These days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive I keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when I go out with my guitars. I also use it to tune my violin, and it works great.If you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better.Over all for the cost you can't go wrong. These used to be expensive none-essentials, but today they're small accurate and portable."
1054,261,4.0,"Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model.  This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package.  The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune).  The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc).  For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price.  Very happy with it!"
806,261,4.0,This little box is great for metronome use. It is loud and the screen is easy to see. The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes. It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar. I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid. I would buy another one if I lost this one.
127,261,2.0,"I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs. I just miss the ""mecanical"" click of a mechanic metronome. The rest is just great. i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better."
1310,261,4.0,"I am quite pleased with this product. It's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight.  It operates on two AA batteries (included). I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate.  The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily. I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment. You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings. There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches. The metronome is pretty loud for the small size. I have a hearing loss, so if I can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good.  The speeds are from 40-208 BPM. You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP (Preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc). Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats. It has a 1/8"" mini earphone jack for private use. It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously. I bought mine from Austin Bazaar.  Shipping was FREE and FAST. I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration."
1383,261,4.0,"As an acoustic guitar player, I think this is a great product.I had previously been using the Korg GA-1, which is a fine basic tuner. The GA-1 works like many basic guitar tuners, where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning (or with one, two, or three flats). But the TM-40 works by just showing the pitch you're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler.Now I use the TM-40 at home as my main tuner, and the GA-1 rides around in my case. Both great products."
735,261,2.0,"Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package. The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat. The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program.Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on. The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest. Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment.Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year. Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability."
425,261,4.0,Works well since I got it. I didn't change battery for more than 6 months.
9,261,4.0,"The tuner is perfect for me.  It fits in the guitar case, mandolin case and the dulcimer case.  Just perfect for making those play dates at the Resonance Fair.  Always spot on with the frequency.  Nice product."
1142,261,2.0,"Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive).The metronome will drive you crazy.  It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible.  Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure.  There are much better sounding metronomes out there.  I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for."
1132,347,3.0,Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had.
137,347,1.0,"Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else."
1407,347,4.0,"If you want to get humidity into a guitar, this product is a must. I works well -- and if one lives in dry area of the country, this is a must have product."
1306,347,4.0,"Erm, it does what it say it would do. The nice thing about the &#34;super&#34;, is its size, in turn, and its ability to hold more water."
242,347,4.0,"Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years.  I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s.  Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years.  Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air.  This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well.  In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover.  In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end.  You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar.  My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar.  I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it.  A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity."
272,347,4.0,"What else is there to say, they are easy to use, they are easy to install and they are easy to check.  I've tried them all and these are the only ones I come back to.  No expensive pads to buy, just use water.  Simple to drop down into the body of guitar, no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole.  Comes out as easy as it goes in.  I have 4 of them.  Love."
1057,347,3.0,"I live in Arizona and I keep my acoustic in the case with this dampit unless I'm playing it.  It seems to do a good job, although I would recommend purchasing a better meter.  The one it comes with is a simple paper design that gives you a decent estimate."
202,347,3.0,"It works well.  This is a classic design that people have used for years and I can see why.  It it isn't broke, don't fix it.The only suggestion I would make is to have a different soundhole cover.  Maybe a sturdy plastic? The soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap, disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket.  I think the price is a little high for what it is. Rubber and foam tube?  Why do they charge so much?  I'd like to know the markup."
536,478,3.0,"It's hard to really describe what this pedal does-  It doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus.  I'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it.  And because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go).  As luck would have it, I acquired one on trade, and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism.  This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr. when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before I run into the amp. I don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though I do believe it works even better in a loop.  I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way). It does very well with single coils.  It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in.  I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics. That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase.  I guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender."
745,478,4.0,"I like it. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. Like all other pedals, it's not ""The Pedal"" (seems like you always need another one). But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound."
989,478,4.0,"This pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces. I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW. This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone. When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier. I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians."
531,478,2.0,"For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound. It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. It definitely doesn't add any more fatness. So my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased Vitamin E regimen. In other words, this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are.Most musicians already use EQ and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you're getting out of this pedal, I think."
273,478,3.0,"I'm not going to do any explaining about the ""science"" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't ""increase"" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a ""night and day"" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the ""must have"" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones."
1018,478,4.0,"This pedal adds that ""I don't know what"" to your sound.I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference.If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until ""it"" comes out of your speakers.A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring.I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off."
1171,478,4.0,"Back in the 90's I used to have an Ampeg guitar head with an effects loop. I discovered the rack version of the BBE in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money. The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120, but sadly it has no effects loop. So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes, because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop. Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and, lo and behold, there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal! I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version. One caveat- if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise. For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it. This pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system. It's also great for vocals as well. But you may want the rack version for those applications. I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through. IMO, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does. I'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain. Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBE's for not much more money that you can use for another application."
267,75,4.0,"I have always loved Hercules products. Their mic stands and guitar stands. They are great quality and very handy, especially this one, for performances where 3 guitars are used."
532,75,4.0,"Sturdily holds three guitars. Fits everything from my bass, to the acoustic or electrics, to the mandolin/ukulele, to the harmonicas in the case.Folds up for transport. Pretty adjustable too.I bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules. I also have the trombone and sax/clarinet stand from them. All A+ at reasonable prices."
3,75,4.0,"Apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  Very stable.  The auto-locking heads rock!  Folds-up pretty compact for travel.  The optional carry bag is a must IMHO."
240,75,4.0,A real workhorse for sure.  Not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars.  I also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big ... almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it.
558,75,4.0,"Just got my stand today... the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced!  Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for.  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars).  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size).  I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'. As it stands (figuratively and literally), the Hercules Tri-Stand does the job excellently with the two banjos.  All three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle.The three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you ""can"" adjust them independently a *little up and down*, but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin.  However, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around.  In my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue.  And of course, considering I am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all...Now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand... First off, no, I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea).  What I ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down. The tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing.  Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top.I give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find.  Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall I am extremely pleased with it."
1121,75,4.0,"If you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise. The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest. They have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be.These things are awesome. Also, everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands. All of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together. Not here, plenty of room for everything now. This stand (and the double version which I also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture. Also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet. With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out. This mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there. Check these things out, you will not be disappointed.Also, as for durability, I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places. It's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it. It doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it). Meanwhile, I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc. I will only every buy Herc stands from now on."
1085,532,4.0,"This is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find.  Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones.  It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound.  It does sound tinny through the 2"" speaker, but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2"" speakers.  I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O. Drive knob.  Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob.  Turning the O.Drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle.  Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp.  I'm building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6"" speaker just for this amp.  According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab."
13,532,3.0,"This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding.  But it is not very good at parties.  it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make.  It is cheap, so you should just get one.  I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings, instruments, and power feed voltage levels.  (see the danelectro power supply for this thing, really cool!)"
675,532,3.0,"This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier. The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive. It also has a headphone jack. In my honest opinion, it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you. The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz, or country) or semi distorted and more (rock). If your looking for an small amp. that will do metal this may not be for you. Defintely get the Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick. Overall it's pretty good."
1316,532,4.0,"If you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp.  It sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks. I said good, not loud.  Loud enough, yes. I suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time.  This is a great little amp for camping, a quick lesson, or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc.. If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased.  Great color and retro style as well."
179,532,4.0,"i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now.i own all the coveted amps/guitars/fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town.i've used all the roland cubes that are battery powered.they were just fine.on a lark, i bought this danelectro honeytone. i'd read some good reviews and $20.00 isnt much money.i was shocked. going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones. but in my gig i have been using a boss me-25 with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc-2 looper and lastly, my phone with all my backing tracks. i play rythm, leads and sing in my gig.i connected all this to the single input of the n-10, put volume 1/2 and tone the same. od turned off. the sound is rich, full and IMHO sounds just as good as my roland cube street ($299.00).i have all the volume i need and great tone. the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set.i am AMAZED by this amp."
1063,532,4.0,I use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great. The clean and distortion channels both sound good paired with the Danelectro Model 59 M.
55,532,4.0,"After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp, for the price (about $16-$17) I had to try it.When I plugged my acoustic into this, I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate.  First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp).My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.I've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time.  This is the best I've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance. I don't know as I'd pay the $40-$50 for this guitar shops often ask, but the Amazon price is perfect. : )One last thing:  Danelectro branded 9v battery included, same color as the amp. Priceless."
1017,532,4.0,"The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me, but this thing is fantastic! clean tones to woodstock fuzz, this thing belts 'em out. only complaint- battery doesn't last too long. get a power adapter. otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP!"
249,858,4.0,"TheDanelectro Honeytone Mini Amp - Beatnik Burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar. The color of this unit is a soft burgundy (almost brick red in color).

I do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig though.A headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amp's impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouse.Included with the amp is an Owner's Manual with simple start-up instructions.

373,858,4.0,"Brough this for trying ""electric"" feels on the acoustic guitar, and don't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic (preamp) guitar or big amp if I don't like the ""eFeels"". After researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than I ask for.  I also brough it with the adaptor, which is great to save $$ for long runs, and I don't have to worry about the battery for home practices.  It is adorable out of the box; it looks like a lovely toy, but it works professionally based on its 10w amp.  I don't care much about the manufactor's suggested modes, basically, I just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds I like in different songs on guitar / uke.  I like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!I had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup; however, when I changed to another one, I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup.  I almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, I have two different pickups to try it deeply.  After using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet.  I have used for few times, so I don't know about its longevity yet!One more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have."
925,858,4.0,"I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change."
511,858,4.0,"This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much ""bigger"" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend!CFH"
131,858,3.0,"i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me. its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,"
1225,858,3.0,"Based on other reviews, I made my purchase. This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough.Two downsides, both are about the noise.1. I live on the 4th floor. As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it. This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live.2. When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise. (Other than the radio part.)None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery."
1426,858,4.0,"I got this when I was just learning how to play guitar.  I was using a borrowed First Act guitar without any amp and I wanted to see what kind of sounds I could make.  It was inexpensive and fun to use.  The sound quality isn't the greatest, but that's to be expected.  You can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds.  It's very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable.  I pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects, but I wouldn't want to take any chances."

1178,858,3.0,"This is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich. Three knobs, volume, tone and gain give it a little versatility. Runs forever on a nine-volt battery. I keep mine next to the couch so I can always plug in and have some fun. It's small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to be.Overall a great little deal for the price. Stop waiting and grab one, you can't go wrong."
593,858,3.0,"It's not going to win any awards for sound quality, but it sure is cute.  As you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall.  But it did the two things I wanted it for.  First, it has a belt clip, which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap.  Second, it has a headphone out, so I can plug in a set of ear buds (1/8&#34; stereo jack).  You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum.  Surprisingly, the Drive control works it's way in gradually, letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control. With the drive control cranked up, you can get the amp unexpectedly loud, but terribly distorted.  For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go, it's not too bad.  With a set of earphones, I would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available.  If you plan to use it as a practice amp and you're not moving about, I would recommend getting a power supply (will use the same ones as most effects pedals).  Battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours, but the performance starts degrading at about an hour's use."
450,858,4.0,"I use this for a bass, and while I cannot get deep tones, it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends.  Tip:  it sounds better if you don't cramp it all the way up - stop at 90%."
1286,858,4.0,"I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands. There is of course, very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny, but hey, it's just a 9 volt battery. I just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device. They put a lot of thought into this amp, and it is outstanding for the budget price. Keep in mind, you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- I will at some point run my Boss Digital Delay box through it to check that out. The belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice, and I got it in red as a change of pace, because I always get &#34;black&#34; with my equipment. It looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character. Nice product, Danelectro."
1234,858,4.0,"I bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... This is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. Just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it."
194,858,2.0,Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries. But if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip.
52,858,3.0,"Ok I've owned 2 of these Danelectro amps. For one they are cheap in price, loud in output, and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap Bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon. Recently I purchased this item on ebay for $10 - Bluetooth Audio Music Receiver V3.0 Wireless Stereo Adapter For Smart PhonesNow I can connect to my tablets, smartphones, and computers and use this amp as a great external Bluetooth speaker.  Plus the battery life is great. Try to buy a BT speaker on amazon with this wattage that's cordless and works from battery power, and you will spend well over $200.The included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes. I installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery (ebay) and it lasts forever.Plus I can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when I want... for this price its hard to beat."
929,858,4.0,"I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, Instead I couldn't put it away, I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, The 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)So spend the $20.00 and get something that is a real deal, I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one"
798,858,0.0,"I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. Bummer. Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?Cheers"
55,858,4.0,"I've tried several &#34;portable amps&#34;.  For the price, the HoneyTone can't be beat.  It has volume, tone and overdrive knobs (the overdrive can go way too over, so easy on that one).  Comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter (important note: reverse polarity, negative central).  Interestingly I have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups.  But for a small, portable, light-weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone... they don't come much better.  It has a belt clip on the back but you'll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them.  Battery is included. Of course a guitar cable is a required extra.Well worth the money."
738,219,4.0,"I'm giving this one 5 stars, with the caveat that you MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one, otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break. The thermoplastic ones broke on me within 2-3 months of use, 3 different ones, until I got the silver one which has not had that problem. Every music store I go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones, and they look in disbelief at me when I say they break. But they did --if I leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea, the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces, and could poke someone's eye out in a public performance, freaky. There's something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation that does it.I live in northern california, so I don't know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem.The SILVER ALUMINUM ONE by contrast, hasn't broken in now nearly a year of use, and shows no hints of doing that. It feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic-- no hint of plastic, but it is very light and not heavy like the G7 ones are. I made sure to order the silver aluminum one through Amazon, since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic, and I only want to make sure I get the aluminum one.The silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really is the best capo I've ever had, super easy to use, very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you're going from playing one song to another (you don't have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it, which is a spectacular design), it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos, and it's out of the way of your hands, doesn't interfere when you play any chord. The screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn't hurt the fingers when turning it. It's the least obtrusive and best capo ever. I'll also add that I have an old carpal injury so I want the least strain, and small hands, so I want the least awkward and most light capo, and this does that. I absolutely love it, and I'm glad that the aluminum ones are durable."
1003,219,4.0,"Nice design... Small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. I am thinking about getting a 2nd one."
789,219,3.0,This inexpensive capo works as advertised. It's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup.
458,219,4.0,"I'm happy with this purchase. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. It works for what I use it for. When not in use, it just gets put away. Doesn't take a lot of space."
594,219,4.0,Purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo.  This capo was just perfect for my needs.
120,219,4.0,In 40 years I have had every kind of capo out there. This is the right one. This one works. Buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case: they are well made and inexpensive enough.
1334,219,4.0,It is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play!
82,219,3.0,Pretty darn good in every way. Trim and easy to use. Solid construction. I recommend this capo without reservation. I like it and it is small.
486,219,4.0,"This is a fantastic little capo.  I say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type, of the Shubb capos I've used.It has a low profile, and I can reach right up to it and still play well.It seems to be sturdy and well constructed, and I love that I can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings.  Just enough so they don't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.Much cheaper than the G7th, and does the job just as well in my opinion.For everyone saying that you can't fit it on the neck, make sure you get the right capo!  If you have a classical guitar, get a classical capo!  If you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo.  If you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks, get the normal one.Don't write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind."
1228,219,4.0,I love this capo better than any I have seen or used. Great quality and price. You wont go wrong with this capo.
327,219,4.0,"I don't have a classical guitar, but I just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non-radiused fingerboard.  I've also got over a dozen capos (don't ask!) but all are for radiused fingerboards.The fingerboards of most steel-string guitars--electric and acoustic--are radiused, that is, they are not flat.  They have a gentle curve to them, so gentle that many wouldn't notice it unless they looked closely. Look up ""fingerboard"" in the Wikipedia for an excellent discussion and Google images for diagrams and pictures.Even though the curve is gentle, if a fingerboard is radiused, a capo must be curved, too, or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz.  If a fingerboard is flat, like a classical guitar's, the capo must be flat, too, or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz.If you're not sure whether your guitar's fingerboard is radiused, slide a ruler between two frets.  If it lies flat, then so is the fingerboard.  If it rocks, the fingerboard is radiused.I REALLY like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw.  This makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure--not tool little, which would cause strings to buzz, and not too much, which would cause the instrument to go out of tune.As others have noted, its one drawback is that it can't be clamped to the headstock when not in use.  But for that, I'd replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo.  HIGHLY recommended!"
1217,219,4.0,My eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo. It's easy for him to use and adjust.
1001,219,4.0,"Love this capo on my electric guitar.  I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily.  Tried other more expensive capos, but this one is the Winner!"
138,219,4.0,In this price point - it's a good capo - if you know how to put one on and use it. I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it - so I'm not losing my G7 capo which was $40. Great capo.
402,219,2.0,"You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this. What a pain. Oh well, it was cheap enough to have around."
931,219,4.0,"This is an awesome capo!  It's sleek, light,easy to install (you can do it with one hand) and looks nice on the instrument.  I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I love the dial, it's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where I can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz.  Awesome product, much better than using a Kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck.  Sounds great on my SG and my acoustic.For those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough.  I think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me."
1205,219,4.0,"There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better."
240,219,3.0,Was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well.  I still use the Kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup.
217,219,4.0,"We ordered one, it worked so nicely, we ordered 2 more.  You can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar, and minimize string stress and de-tuning each time you move your capo.  Very nice product."
913,219,4.0,This is a very nice product to use.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is small enough to be out of the way while playing.
201,219,3.0,"These are nice, easy to use capos and the price was great.  I got several of them to use during my guitar class, when someone doesn't have a capo and needs one."
232,219,4.0,"I purchased a Classical guitar and only had a traditional (steel string) Capo available to me. Not thinking it through I used it on my Nylon Stings and after a few times I realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced. Along with my string order I added this Capo so it does not happen again.Pros:It's small and lightweight.It's very well made. It not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality.It's very adjustable. Unlike my steel string Capo, this uses a screw/knob to tighten, not spring loaded. This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.It works on steel strings. Yep, I found my self needing a Capo on another guitar and only having this with me, I saw no reason it should not work so I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully. I won't be using it full time on my steel strings, but great to know in a pinch I have use it.If you need a great capo thats gentle on your Nylon strings then this is the one to get."
11,219,4.0,I always seem to have to re-tune with the spring loaded capo's.  Rarely have to re tune with this one.  Highly recommend.
1403,219,1.0,"I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;."
133,90,4.0,"A Little History:I have been a guitar player for forty-odd (some of them, VERY odd) years.  For the first thirty of them, I tuned by ear - starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like, then tuning the other five strings by fretting, listening and tuning.  I could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord, yet remained `off' for others... it took quite a long time to get it right.  Then, about ten years ago, I thought I had figured it out.  The problem (I thought) was that my guesses at a true ""E"" were off - so I got myself an ""E"" tuning fork (320 cycles) and used it to tune the first string.  Then, I did as I had always done - fretted and tuned the other five. Not much better as a result - kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right.  During those years, I tried tuning all six strings to (what I believed was an accurately tuned) piano as well as by ear to tones available online.  Nothing gave me better tuning on the first try.  Then, I saw an ad for a Chromatic Tuner and lightening struck.The Realization:There have been many -  each of which has led me closer to what I have now - near perfect tuning on the first go `round!  First off, I realized that when we say ""E"", that is not just one note.  It is a range of literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- of specific tones.  The same is true for every note.  This is akin, I guess, to the realization as a child, that no matter how many shades of `blue' are in a box of crayons, the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare.  Purchasing my first Chromatic Tuner (a CT440, manufactured by SwitchMucic and sold through MusiciansFriend.com) moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning.  However, that tuner had at least two limitations. Firstly, it's construction is rather light and flimsy - it works OK, but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the Korg (for about the same price)  That is that the Korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you.  Both tuners have plug-in for electric instruments, and, so far as I can tell, their accuracies are similar.  I prefer the Korg for the reasons I have mentioned.  Additionally, the Korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs - and `remembers' the original tuning/tones so you can return to it for more `standard' usage. A nice, extra piece of flexibility. The LCD meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you, right away, whether you are sharp, flat (and by how much!) or right on!As a point of surprising interest, the tuning fork I had used for years turns out to be profoundly FLAT! A shock to me - given that I had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones! I have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be. I guess the round pitch pipe that Ms. Sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed!And Finally:This is a marvelous little (and inexpensive) device - well constructed, accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances.  I assume that there will be still higher places for my `learning curve' in this area to rise to - but for right now, this is it.  I am using it, regularly, on all my stringed instruments (two six-string Martins, a twelve string Epiphone and a frailing banjo.  The time it saves tuning the 12-string alone makes it more than it's own price!)If you have not discovered Chromatic Tuning (maybe I really WAS the last one to discover these things!?), I suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds `really' right. Perhaps people with `perfect pitch' can do very nicely without a Chromatic Tuner - I am not one of them. Are you?"
1074,90,1.0,"It is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it."
1409,90,2.0,"This is a nice little tuner. It is small, easy to read and use. It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat. It has a green LED and large mark for being on target. It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that. The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is. Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear. (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. Other than that, it seems to work well. It is consistent, easy to use, and compact. I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device. I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive."
543,90,4.0,"What can I really say! Tunes my entire arsenal.From. Cigar Box Guitar, 3 string Strummers, Tacoma Papoose, andmy brand new Laguna 6 string..Getting ready to make few Uke's and it will Tune them also..Need a all n one Tuner, buy this or an I-Phone? The Korg is the perfectTuner.."
735,90,3.0,"I've had two of these tuners. They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. They're durable and have a long battery life. Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440. Strange."
1347,631,4.0,"Excellent Product, it is well cushioned. I'm a typical overweight American. Great Sale Price!(Lucky Timing) All Black and fully Assembled! Doesn't get any easier than that... (Batman)"
696,631,4.0,I bought this bench on an Amazon Warehouse Deal so that I could get it on Prime delivery and was not disappointed at all. The bench is very sturdy and comfortable - the cushioning is thick and soft. The item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds. This bench is just what I was looking for and I'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years.
1006,631,3.0,"I actually like this bench a lot. It fits into my gear back (rolling duffle style) that contains my cables / power strips etc., with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag. I have the KT7800, which is much larger seat area, and easier to adjust. Depends on your preference I suppose, this one is smaller / lighter, the other is larger / easier to adjust."
868,631,2.0,"It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there."
610,631,4.0,"For me, I can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height. The padding is great, it is lightweight without feeling cheep."
402,631,3.0,"I bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard. It was already assembled right out of the box, and seems well padded and sturdy. My daughter likes it. I like the price because of the special deal from Amazon."
1390,631,2.0,"It isn't top of the line but it gets the job done. I wouldn't abuse of the chair too much though, the material looks a little floosy."
59,631,4.0,"I'm a heavier fellow (5'11, 220) and some of the harder benches I've tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions. This one, on the other hand, is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support. It folds up easily and looks to be very well made. 5 stars, no complaints, and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options."
202,631,4.0,"The price is a great selling point, just by itself.  I use it with my acoustic guitar and the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest that I bought off Amazon as well.  It's a good combo.  It leads me to playing for longer periods.  It's solidly constructed.  It folds and is definitely portable.  Great buy."
1016,877,3.0,I needed some fretboard cleaner. This is something I had not tried before. I used it and I like it.
515,877,3.0,"Has a nice smell, works like a charm. This bottle will probably last me 10 years. Good cheap price...a recommended purchase."
1239,877,3.0,Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good.
190,877,4.0,"Nice quality fretboard oil. Has a nice scent to it, and remember a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this. Worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard."
536,266,3.0,"This is an iconic fuzz pedal.  Yes, Smashing Pumpkins used this pedal but Corgan also used a Fender Blender (which is similar to the Big Muff but has an octive thing going on too).  This is not a subtle pedal.  It's cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp.  I find that it gets a little muddy if I run it into an amp that's already breaking up.  I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though.  This is not a wooly, splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face.  It really has it's own thing going on.  It's not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time, but it's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox.  If I had it to do all over again I would likely buy the Big Muff with the tone wicker switch.  It's about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability."
863,266,2.0,i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars.  but it's just not for me.  it's large and takes up space on my pedal board.  i prefer the little big muff
818,266,4.0,"I have played through this for over 15 years and I will tell you right now, get a big amp. Get 2 amps and split the signal, even. You want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal. Otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of ""Frail and Bedazzled"".Otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference, and it should. I have been in a couple bands where I just plugged this into the amp and played my riffs. The free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter.If you're looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz, this is the pedal you need. I only wish it went up to ""11""."
1251,266,2.0,"I owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment.  It produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing.  The sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: ""White Room, Black Curtains""; ""Satisfaction""; ""Ina Gadda da Vida"".  Note:  this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack.  As such, it will not really do the ""Whole Lotta Love"" sound.  As I said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited.  If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound.  If you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect."
1294,266,3.0,I cannot express how over sized this pedal is - it's ridiculously big and it's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.Again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone
884,266,2.0,"It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product."

648,352,4.0,"I don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.

157,352,3.0,"A great universal bag. I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body. Has great pockets to carry your picks, strings, and tuners. The padding is better that I expected. It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color."
112,352,4.0,"Arrived on schedule.  Sturdy, with adequate padding to protect my &#34;babies&#34;.  Three zipper pockets to hold cords, mics, capos and tuners as still have room for keys and combs.  I own several gig bags, and this is my favorite."

891,352,4.0,"This case is very durable, nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage. The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel. The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life."
785,352,4.0,I bought a Hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case I decided to take it anywhere. The prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times. I have other guitars and they all have cases and I might never actually take this guitar anywhere so I didn' twant to spend a lot. Price was a big issue. The guitar fits great. The bag is well padded and I can't believe the price.
68,352,4.0,"I purchased this for my daughter who is 10.  She is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar I bought her.  This bag has plenty of storage, offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly.  I am going to purchase another one for my guitar."
510,370,3.0,"Decent quality.  Cheap price.  We'll see how long it lasts.  But, for now, does the trick.  I think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand."
166,370,4.0,"This is a very good and stable stand. Light, strong, and very balanced. It makes my guitar feel secure. It is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag."
635,370,4.0,"This is my favorite light weight guitar stand, simple and does the job.  I try to avoid the stands with lever locking mechanisms at the neck rest which are a pain in the arse when you are trying to switch guitars on the fly.  These are lightweight and collapsible so you can take them anywhere, and are sturdy enough for 'normal' use.  If you're a klutz no guitar stand will be sufficient unless it is encased in carbonite."
126,370,3.0,"I have my 12 string on this stand when I'm taking a break from practicing (as you know, a case is where you should store your guitars, not on a stand). It is easy to assemble. You'll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one. if you're gigging, I might suggest a higher priced stand, but for occasional travel and home use, this will do the trick."
434,370,4.0,"This guitar stand does NOT find hidden treasure. It does NOT hypnotize beautiful women. It does NOT fix your transmission. It does NOT tell your boss to give you a raise.It just holds onto your guitar when you don't see any reason to put into a case. It's sturdy, reliable and to the point. No gimmicks, nothing flashy. Just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced. If you need one, might as well be this one."
242,370,4.0,"There are a fair number of similar tripod guitar stands out there for about the same cost.  If one of your pet peeves with some of these is that the U-shaped support falls out when you carry the assembled stand around, then you'll especially like the World Tour stand.  The way that the U-shaped piece inserts makes it far less susceptible to falling out. And, although it is, as one other reviewer put it, ""minimalistic,"" this stand has a substantial feel to it.  I'm quite happy with this purchase, and would buy another World Tour again, rather than one of the other brands that I own.  Amazon.com did a great job, too, getting this out to me."
660,370,4.0,"I've bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years, and I've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones, and this is the best one I've found yet. Very sturdy, well made, and fully height adjustable, with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up. It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged, so at least it lets you know that ahead of time(most cheap stands don't), so that's a good thing as well. Don't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand, grab this one!"
911,370,3.0,"I got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars.  Great little stands at a great price.  They are sturdy, easy to assemble and adjustable.  I'd suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand."
23,370,4.0,I ordered two of these stands and they work very well! Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things.
623,66,4.0,"Case  arrived in great condition.Quite Roomy, fits my Vendetta AND/Or my Les Paul - Two exterior pockets for tools, extras, etc.2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP, but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I'm not hauling them to shows...Get One."
1369,66,4.0,"I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good.  I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe!  Nice padding, nice features."
660,66,4.0,"This is a great gig bag for the money. It has more padding than I thought it would have, has very strong construction, and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables. The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well. It's even reasonably water proof, handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks. For the money, this is the best one I've bought on Amazon, and will certainly buy it again in the future. Highly recommended!"
860,66,4.0,"This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more. For the price, I feel like it is a steal. Some people complain about the smell. It kind of smells like motor oil. It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me. Be warned about it though."
629,66,4.0,"This is a great bag, regardless of cost. The fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal. (Free shipping only makes it that much better.) Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed any objectionable smell. I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed. The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection. (I would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick.) In addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue. The two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch. In my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain. As it is, it's very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II."
681,28,4.0,"I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it. I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile, but the selection of lengths is limited. I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board. I swear I was done in 20 minutes!! The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length. These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality. The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip, flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step. I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables."
401,28,2.0,"The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place. All you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the "" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight.As a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug.Great right?Well, not really.As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered. With the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice. In the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed.I have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around. The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but I have experienced problems in the past. Always have a few spares that have been tested.Another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient.Is it easier than soldering? Yes.Are they reliable? For the most part, yes.Will I continue using the product? Yes, because I usually have spares.Why do I use them then? I'm lazy.This is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectors:Don.t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors. The thin soft gold (5-10 microns) .flash. plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! The brass eventually  tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts.It is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket. But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs."
930,28,4.0,I am a tech as well as a guitar player. I also have spent time in the past Teaching soldering. But these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections. Most of us know by now that there's a lot of hype but it really comes down to Good Quality Cable (This Seems to be) Good Stable Connectors (These seem to be) & the connections between the two that last (Time will tell). All I know is I have Hand Soldered Special plugs with Good Cable to only have them break with use and I expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged & unplugged often.- I do know these are signal clean & do Not bleed f highs & that is critical in my book.- They are Very Easy to use & can be done on Stage between or before sets very quickly and with NO Soldering & I Love that!I will definitely use these again unless I find a longevity problem.LM
1385,28,4.0,Very good quality cable and plugs. Easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft. My pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that I actually made room for 1 more because there was no extra wire to get in the way.
1063,28,4.0,This is one of my favorite music purchases in a while. Cleans up your gear's appearance tremendously. Very easy to use and lots of extra cable length.
1386,28,4.0,"What can I say? I started out with a couple of pedals, then a wah, then more, then a board for them, and sooner or later all those 6&#34; cords are either in the way, too short or whatever. I do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you've got odd distances. This kit does the trick, and truly was easy to use. Only once did I create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it."
843,316,4.0,"I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books. This stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books.The construction is much better than other portable stands I've used in the past, and has two great features that I really appreciate. One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional. With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make."
935,316,4.0,"As a newbie violin student I needed a music stand.  Having purchased many things before through Amazon.com, I have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted (remembering that there will always be a few cranks).  This music stand got good reviews and I can say that I too am very happy with it.  I would recommend this purchase to any one."
893,316,2.0,This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it.
1138,340,4.0,Its easy to set up and use. Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it. I re soak it easy 2-3 weeks or so. Can't tell if it's truly working on my maple wood ukulele.
115,340,4.0,I have been using Hercos for for many years. They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification.  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits.For guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other. Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness.
918,340,4.0,"I like these humidifiers.  Works if you keep it with instrument in your case, and upkeep is minimal.  Work on all strings very well, but be careful, easy to fall out of case, so just be careful!"
154,340,3.0,Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity. A must have for us dry Californians.
1277,340,0.0,It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water.
795,340,4.0,"I was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that I need a humidifier for my guitar. At first I was not sure what I was looking for. I found the product without too much difficulty. I had learned from my instructor that these are small, placed on the hole of the guitar, and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition. I started looking through the computer pages and settled on the Herco Guitar Humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product. Now I feel I made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations, and good music!"
1304,340,3.0,Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile. Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part. I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood. I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist. The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward. I may order another if this one performs well.
536,199,3.0,"Great slap echo sound.  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb.  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!).  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc.  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp.  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint.  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year."
1206,199,2.0,"This pedal works but doesn't have the depth of echo I expected. I doesn't even come close to the same sound quality of my old Dan Echo DE-1 pedal.  That certainly explains the difference in price. You get what you pay for. I'm using it with a Fender Eighty-Five solid state amp. I tried it with other amps and it sounds the same. If you're looking for a good slap echo effect, I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE-1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo, but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal. The FAB echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it. It's just not as good as I expected. I'm sorry I bought it and I don't recommend this pedal. There are much better ones on the market. Shop around."
1395,199,4.0,"I've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down. I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't. This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy. Really quick to setup and use. It's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!"
1203,199,4.0,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
1288,199,4.0,this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music.the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard. but for 20 dollars its well worth the price.  this is a great product and i highly recomend it.
367,199,2.0,"I'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate: The pedal gave up the ghost (died) In a relatively short amount of time. I replaced it with  mini modtone type delay.... I actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better."
777,199,3.0,"I admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out. I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff. Anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out.You know, it is a pretty decent stompbox. The slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top....just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo...not quite delay, not quite reverb...kind of somewhere in between. I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different. Not bad at all. I cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects. For kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah....Anyway....Enjoy!"
653,199,3.0,"Is the the best pedal ever? Not even close. Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do? Absolutely! I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound. It can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay, rockabilly sound. It's not super versatile but if you're looking for a little depth and color for under $20 then this is what you need.I mean, COME ON! It works, it's cheap, and it doesn't take up much room on your pedal board!"
746,199,4.0,It has a 1950's slap back echo Its good for the price No putting It down for Sounding bad as with most Danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits. If You want something that Is just reverb without all the slap back then Behringer DR600 which I use for Vocal for Guitar I use RV600 which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer.
1084,199,4.0,"I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it. The sound I get with it is very, very cool. After a while it just stopped working. While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online. You can't beat the price. If it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal. All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death. An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since I could replace for $15. So I ordered another one. Definately get an adapter for this. Yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy. Just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off. Guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's. Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet. If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals...well...I'd suggest buying them by the gross. Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips. Used alone or with other effects, the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis."
1295,199,2.0,good price for effect  if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you.  I have amps that have this feature that due a better job.
1207,49,4.0,"It's a flange pedal, what else? For the price I was really happy with it. If I knew someone who was more skilled than me I'd get the workings inside a different case. The shape is cool, but I'd feel safer with it in a metal casing. The button is smaller than I thought, but it's not an issue at all; it's kinda easier to press!As for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals, for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm, I would recommend this!"
173,49,4.0,"The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end (My fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker rattled the walls) of its sweep and can give a very cool effect. I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed. Also, the speed know has a great range with 5+ second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones. The depth knob does it's job. It doesn't have a manual knob to move the sweep, but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it's no big deal. For the price, this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp."
1007,49,3.0,"-1 star for plastic...otherwise excellent , YouTube has many reviews on these,The FAB pedals are great values,For what a flanger is for me, this is perfect, great sounds great price."
1288,49,4.0,"the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun!!! this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more! wide sweeping flange effect, great harmonics and little power useage.  well worth the investment!!!!"
70,354,4.0,"I'm a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished.  I want them to be slick when I bend notes.  If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool, it can wear down your frets.  These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets.  I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them.  I think Amazon had the best price."
322,354,4.0,"I opened the package for the first time and didn't think much of it, but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job.  Obviously, cardboard isn't going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths."
1344,354,0.0,"The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it."
1081,38,4.0,I use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great! It's got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too. Battery lasts for months. Well done Behringer!
728,38,3.0,"Solidly built, small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag.  There isn't really much in the way of instructions, but the LEDs are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out."
1401,38,4.0,If you are in a band or a sound guy for a band you gotta have one of these. The time and stress saved by not depending on trial and error to eliminate good/bad cable is priceless. Bottom line!!! eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve.
15,38,4.0,A must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables.  I keep this with my battery tester for my active's.  Sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble.  Easy to use and economical product.
877,38,4.0,"We bought this tester for our son to use for his band's equipment set-up. It appears to be well constructed, and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues."
302,38,3.0,"I have been using this tester for about a year to test out my XLR cables and those that I come into contact with at work. It works but does not detect all faults (only non intermittent ones), it comes in a durable enough housing and is compact enough to take everywhere."
99,38,4.0,Does a great job of checking cords. Was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash. Tests multiple types of cords also!
1091,38,3.0,"I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection. The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok. It is well built and sturdy. The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table. I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.Although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful. It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack. For example, it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad. I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram. As it turns out, the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester. The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand."
1143,38,3.0,"Idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. All metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand LED readouts. Runs on 2 AA batteries.Features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPyle-Pro PCT10are:-'Test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'Intermittent' issue indication - This is what made me choose this model. If there's even the shortest dropout, the LEDs indicate it. Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.My only complaints:-The a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. Quite frustrating. Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-There's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. This clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. Luckily I have no need for the clip. I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. I stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.After the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. Too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box."
1207,398,3.0,"For the price, it's worth it I guess. If you just want to try it, go for it, that's what I got it for. It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup, but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal. But for the price it's not too bad.Oh, and the casing isn't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic. it's pretty durable. Albeit don't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps."
1326,398,3.0,"I mean you paid 15$ for a pedal that if you want to buy from the BOSS it's about 6times this price and if you want it behringer it's about twice this price. It does what is supposed to and it doesn't have a cheap look. For home and garage entertainment is good enough. I was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand, but now that i know that i like it i'm going to buy the distortion (red) one. i'm only sad they don't make a noise gate or something similar. That would be the top of the deal."
692,398,1.0,The Chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have.
1030,398,2.0,"the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
586,398,4.0,"This puppy sounds fantastic. The controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top Chorus with deep and intense sound. The controls are on the front, as are the in/out plugs, so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs. Very reasonable pricing. Uses a 9V battery or 9V adaptor. It has a retro look and an old school sound, perfect."
1395,398,4.0,"How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didn't need chorus at all. This pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. Sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. I even like it with the bass. Just a great chorus with not much to tweak."
1203,398,4.0,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-5 Chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...

764,398,4.0,"Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50's chorus settings.  I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele, my Applause acoustic/electric, and my Squier Vintage Modified 70's bass guitar. And like other folks who've bought this product, I'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply."
1157,398,4.0,"The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals.  Cheap.  Mass-produced.  Housed in a plastic casing.  But the FAB series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more.  If this pedal cost $50, I might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9V jacks are.  I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix, Speed, and Depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch.  But at this price, for it to sound THIS good, I can't complain at all.Don't expect the FAB series to be good at everything.  But if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the FAB series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals.  It's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists."
446,398,3.0,"Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings.(Think Alice in chains, or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo) admittedly not everyone's into the whole grunge tone. But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey, you can pretty much get it for pocket change."
268,398,2.0,"its sound pretty good .. i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried ..but i stomp on it regularly.. it cuts my signal a bit .. so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up..all in all=worth it."
218,27,4.0,"I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices. Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price, but pleasantly surprised when we received it."
725,27,3.0,"I got the $50 standard black on black case.  The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush! Wow! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway. Regarding the item itself, I am bit lukewarm. I have a $500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions. And I got that. Its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head.  However, the fit is a bit loose and I don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time.  So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy."
664,27,4.0,"My Seagull Entourage Rustic fits very snug (I think that is a good thing, not certain) in the case which has a nice faux fur lining and seems well made.I was considering theSeagull Dreadnought Casebut there were no useful pictures or details on the item. I decided to try the Guardian and save a few bucks.Seems like I made a good choice."
1169,27,2.0,"Guardian?  Well, it is padded, but I've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and I can say that the case is nicked up ""pretty good,"" as they say in the South.  Yes, it will last, because it is a guitar case, but there's no way there's enough security to protect an instrument on a plane.  Now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the ""guardian"" fails to guard against crushing your hardware.  This item is not one of the better cases out there, but it does suffice, and it does look good.  The first day I got it, someone said, ""nice case, it looks great!""  Say that now, though, after using it outside the house 4 times, and you'd be a lying SOB."
646,27,2.0,"This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China.  I bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 Gibson ES-135 archtop.  Lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge.  Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for.  The case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but I didn't expect an exact fit.  The wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases.  Normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around.  Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay.  This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use.  Only annoying thing: the case arrived locked.  The keys were, of course, inside the case.  Dumb.  A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it.  A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out."
433,27,4.0,"Great quality, nice interior, and fits my Yamaha F335 perfectly. Solid and steardy case that will last a very long time."
1112,27,4.0,my fav cases ever
358,808,4.0,"Good quality, strong and excellent finish. Nicely priced. A foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing, a must for classical players."
297,808,4.0,It does exactly what it says it does.  My only complaint is I wish it could go a notch or two lower.  But very pleased.  It's cheap and works like a champ
409,808,4.0,"It's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from, very good value at only $10 not counting shipping, very satisfied."
1367,808,4.0,"I've been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately, and this is my favorite purchase as of late.  I've bought nice straps, but when I'm practicing for hours at a time, this foot rest is a great reprieve, and literally a weight off my shoulders."
888,808,4.0,Was using a box and this is a great help.  My stomach doesn't feel wrenched anymore.  I use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg.  Maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me.
613,808,4.0,"Great foot rest, it's not flimsy.  But it's not light weight.  I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that it's there.  I like that it's adjustable to various heights.  I am short (5'1"") so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when I'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle.  But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when I'm playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, I shift it over to my right leg.  I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when I'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing.  Great foot rest, I recommend it."
498,808,4.0,"Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated.  I was worried it would not hold the weight, but it does well."
211,808,4.0,I was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what I got.  There isn't too much to say about it.  It's sturdy.  It's adjustable.  It's a great price.  It really made playing easier for me.
1327,808,4.0,"This little foot stool is really sturdy. It stays in place beautifully. No rocking sideways, no wobbly action.If one of the notches doesn't do it for you, you're screwed: There's no gradual adjustment. But the positions it allows make sense for 99% of players."
1409,808,3.0,
1252,808,4.0,"This is heavy, but strong.  Very comfortable, I cannot carry it around with me, but it works well at home.  I recommend it."
525,808,2.0,"I like this product, but wish it had a wider foot or base to it for carpeted areas, it does get a little unstable on carpet.  Does fine on hard floors."
1427,808,4.0,"The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly."
59,808,0.0,"This thing is useless. Good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. Unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. Pass on this."
202,808,4.0,This is quality construction.  It's definitely a must.  I'm a taller guy and it's important to have proper posture for longer playing periods.  I'm glad I bought this.
1311,808,4.0,I've owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one.  This one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value.I'm 6'2 and weigh 225.  There are numerous adjustment angles that I can switch to and be comfortable and I'm not concerned about the legs bending.  The photo makes them look weaker than they are.
1354,529,4.0,"I purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear.  I liked the fact that it was open in the back so I could patch things in and out easily before I bought a patch bay.  I find it very sturdy and well made, and I've loaded it almost completely full.  I do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom."
1402,529,4.0,"First off, most audio racks have that annoying &#34;slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them&#34; instead of properly sized holes. Not this one. Not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them, but it even includes 48 screws so you don't have to try to figure out which of the 3 sizes you've collected over the years is going to fit.I loaded it up with equipment and haven't had a worry about it since. Solid construction and the mounting just works. This one is done right."
1412,529,2.0,Simple and useful rack stand. Easy to assemble. Easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. A little more interest in the manufacture means more quality.
1013,529,4.0,"This is exactly the item I needed for my podcasting rig.  It holds my Behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box.  It lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when I need to use my table for something besides podcasting.The stand is easy to assemble and is very well built.  There's nothing bad I can say about it, if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up.  Highly recommended."
806,529,4.0,This stand is great for my 45lb Peavey 1500. It is a light weight rack and I had to put the amp toward the bottom. I wouldn't put much more in it but it is exactly what I needed. I can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily. Haven't tried gigging with it but if you are gentle I think it would work fine.
1267,529,4.0,"This rack stand is made up of a heavy steel, and welded together very well. I received my rack stand yesterday, and put it together in under 5 minutes. My audio equipment mounted easily, with the 48 INCLUDED mounting screws, and everything looks great, and I don't have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over. It is very sturdy, and very stable. I recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to 12 audio or networking devices. I will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once I fill this one up. I will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly."
1325,529,0.0,"I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this."
1266,529,3.0,"it ok, its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle, the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface....11u rack, not 12u...."
167,529,4.0,"I use this with my mobile DJ equipment and it is fantastic. Very sturdy and light enough to easily carry. Holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation. Plastic covers on the feet came off right away though, but not really a big deal to me."
955,246,3.0,"The ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear. It's built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time I've had it. Since I normally power it with a wall wart, I don't have much of an opinion about battery life.Bottom Line: It costs a bit more than the standard Dunlop wah pedals, it's worth it."
1388,246,3.0,"Sure it's a few bucks more than the standard Crybaby, but totally worth it. Built like a tank, but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings."
241,246,4.0,"for 99 dollars , quit looking at other wah pedals....this one does it all......its so versatile....sounds very authenic 60's too,.....good pedal movement....endless variations in sound avaialable.....it gets a great sound right out of the box ..dig it man,,!!"
733,246,3.0,"Your option to change the wah configuration is amazing. Only problem is the no DC adapter included, needs buy separately."
679,246,4.0,"Lunar lander here we come, This pedal will take your playing to the moon. It's easy to use, I recommend getting the 9v AC adapter to save on batteries and avoid the battery hassle. Use the Crybaby with other effect pedals, the uses are endless and fun. I was playing some 'Born On The Bayou' Creedence guitar the other day and wow, It will build your music muscle power to try and keep up with where this pedal wants to send you. A keeper, not like pedals that have no lasting power, this pedal has so much to offer over such a wide range of playing styles. It's right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time. I'm sure I'll be using the Crybaby for the rest of my music life."
441,246,4.0,"Wow!  This is the pedal to own.  There are a lot of good pedals out there, but this one has that original, bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from 70's quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps. Just amazing! If you don't have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal, this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine. A great purchase and built like a tank."
974,246,4.0,This is the wah I was looking for.  Very versatile and built in boost feature is great too. buy it...you wont regret it.
1070,246,4.0,"First of all, I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal. I will tell you my wah pedal story.Several years ago, I bought a Crybaby GCB-95 and, even though I did not use wah very much at the time, I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year. Fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time. Finally, I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely.A couple years ago, I bought a Digitech XP-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morello's style. Since it has some digital wah patches was available, I started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my GCB-95. The wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good.Finally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains, ""Man in the Box"" and the Digitech was just not going to cut it. So, it was time to get a real wah. I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used. I chose the 535Q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile.You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started. I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles. That setting works will in songs like RATM, ""Bulls on Parade"" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch DJ sounds.I still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs. I think that as long as I need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! It is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad."
1170,141,3.0,"I know most budget guitars don't come with cases, most not even a gig bag anymore. That's the trade-off I guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down. Even my Fender Standard Telecaster came sans-case and I had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gig-bag as an incentive but even that was back in the day. I had not looked at guitar gear in so long that I didn't think about guitar cases until I got the itch to get a new six-string and came across these. They look great, seem well built(I am not a professional touring musician) and apparently do the job.The exterior is covered in black tolex, just like a pricey case, and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price. The storage compartment is adequately sized and there's a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched. There are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case. It fits both my MiM Tele andSquier by Fender Deluxe Stratocaster Maple Neck, Pearl White Metallicperfectly and I suspect it will do a fine job protecting them.I will be picking up a tweed version for the Telecaster to match up with the style, and my lovely Fender amp. Like I stated, there's no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case."
1095,141,3.0,"This is better than a gig bag, for sure, and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric. Now, it's not padded really well and doesn't look like it'll hold up for more than a few years, but it was cheap. It seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly, which is why I drop a star."
433,141,4.0,I bought to use for my squire strat. It also fit my tele to. A real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig.
259,141,3.0,"This is an inexpensive but for the money, well built case. I don't have any complaints. My Fender Strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn't the most durable case (I wouldn't use it to ship my guitar) it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next."
59,141,4.0,"I've bought three of these now - this is an awesome, well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily. The most recent was for something rather unique (a fanned fret, compound scale eight string) and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare.There are more expensive options out there, but for a non-fitted ""do it all"" case, this is the best bang for your buck hands down. I am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars, from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs. Great case, great price."
511,443,4.0,"The Pyle ""Battery Powered PA System With Wireless Microphone"" is surprisingly well made and has features I would have expected on much more expensive equipment. We run workshops, often at our customer's locations, and needed a portable PA system that could easily be transported and doesn't require a lot of power. Here are my observations:+ Long Battery Life - Worked for over 4 hours straight, but can be connected to AC to work as well+ Wireless Microphone - Built into the system, has good range, and acceptable sound. Battery included.+ Inputs for 2 Microphones, 1 Guitar, and 1 Audio Connection - Each with it's own volume control+ Portable - Built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy+ Includes a mini-Plug to 1/4"" Converter - A handy accessory+ Includes Echo Effect - A fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice (my kids loved playing with this :-)Note: My unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work.This unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit!Highly Recommended!"
1077,443,4.0,It works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power.  the portable feature is great also. Just what i wanted
1366,443,3.0,".I'm a guitar player and singer who works with a band and as a solo and as a duo with a bass player. I found one of these used for half the retail price. It had no microphone but I already have mics and I don't like wireless anyway and don't need one. Besides, who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works.Well, it was great. I brought a small Behringer guitar amp in case I had to choose between guitar and vocals in terms of sound quality since the unit has onle one set of tone controls. BIG surprise; my Martin GPA sounded great through the PWMA-230 and so did my vocals. I didn't need anything else for a duo gig in a large and semi-loud bar. Volume was strong, the sound was clear and full and the guitar and voice sounded as natural as could be. It's light as a feather (I have troubles with my knees and use a cane and it was no problem) and it sounds great. And since I play there once a week I left it at the gig and do not worry about theft or breakage since the unit is so inexpensive and replaceable even at the marketplace price. I might give it 4 1/2 stars but I can't figure out how to get half-stars. This is a godsend to one and two person acts who already have enough to carry. With my ZT Club amp for my Telecaster for band gigs and the PWMA-230 for acoustic gigs I have more room, less to carry and less to worry about.Update Oct. 25th:I think others have mentioned problems with Pyle-Pro Audio's customer service. I must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too. I wrote to them praising their product and asked if for specs on the power cord and whether they sold an extra in case I lost the one that came with the unit and if they also sold a cover for it. I wrote a least three times and got no response so far. The website was no help and calling them directly was worse; got the wrong dept., was transferred to a dept. which never picked up the phone. I still love the PWMA230 but I am no fan of its manufacturer.Update Oct. 28To be fair, someone did finally contact me today. My questions were unanswered and I don't think my e-mail was read very carefully but at least they did respond. I'll update as to the answers and information provided."
1320,443,1.0,"This system works just okay.  Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item.  I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating!"
1167,30,4.0,"This is a wonderful product for the price! Ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain. A little difficult to set up properly, but if you are running an eq separate, then you only have to adjust the input and output. I dont care much for the tube display with led lights behind it, but it doesn't bother me either. Behringer makes great products at incomparable prices."
1412,30,2.0,"I like this preamp. I use one channel for microphone and the other for an electric guitar with good results.Is very sadly and spendthrift that its useful life will be the duration of its tube, another concept of producci&oacute;n nothing considered with consumer and planet."
888,30,2.0,"Don't like that it's difficult to change the tube.  Sound quality was not what I expected, maybe because I wasn't familiar with the settings.  No power cord was included in mine or manual.  Manual should have been include not sure about the cord.  Dials are very small.  My MIC200 and MIC800 are much better than this.  I can't say it's bad.  Just that there are better choices in my opinion."
415,30,4.0,"I operate an alternative broadcast studio, we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet. We needed some stand-alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet I decided to give this Behringer unit a try.This single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps, each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output. Before I even tried the piece as a preamp I opened it up to look inside.DO NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE THE TUBEThe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one.Fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube. There is no schematic provided so it's really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit.HOW DOES IT SOUNDThe preamps sound very good, full, rich, crisp highs, deep lows, it's a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as I can tell. For comparison I A-B compared this preamp to our very expensive API 3124+ preamp which is a 4-channel unit that we paid over $500 per preamp-channel for, that is 10-times the price per channel of this Behringer unit. I'm not going to say the Behringer beat the API but they were a dead heat in most listening tests. My female partner who is not too technical (but has great ears) thought the Behringer was just as good as the API. We also have a Grace m801 which is another over-$500/channel preamp, she definitely liked the Behringer sound better than the Grace (personally I think it was the EQ on the Behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the Grace).If my API or Grace preamps go toast I will definitely have them repaired. If the Behringer dies, it's going in the trash and I'll buy another one. It's simple economics and at $100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice. They sound good. They have an industry standard packaging. The input and output connectors are excellent. It even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line-level signal (I have not tried this because we don't need it).We broadcast between three and ten, live one-hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals. NOBODY in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high-end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp. Now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows.RELIABILITYWe have not had any problems with this unit. It is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast, I've never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it. We have A LOT of Behringer gear in our studio, it lives right along side gear from Neve, API, Allen and Heath, UA, Meyer, Lexicon and Apogee. Out of 103 pieces of Behringer equipment I've bought we've had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box. I had much worse reliability with Crown amplifiers than Behringer products and I really like Crown amps, regardless of the problems, they just sound so good. In my experience the Behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price. That's a win-win in my book."
834,225,4.0,"This is not a top tier condenser mic, but it is well worth the 40 dollar price tag. It has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch. The carrying case is also nice.Do not expect this to be MXL or even Behringer B-1 quality, but it's still better than no condenser, and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic'ing."
315,225,3.0,I tested in my friend recording studio and work really good trust me for the price it over the top
888,225,4.0,"Seems to work well.  Like the other reviewers said, you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing.  solid construction.  getting used to the attachment.  It will never stand in the position like in the photo.  There's no resistance on that joint so it flops down.  Just place it upside down.  Record using a headset or you'll get too much feedback.  Just ordered a shorter stand.  Hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down."
515,225,4.0,"No complaints at all. I use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a Pod Studio UX2. Have had tons of compliments on the sound. People can't belive its a 50 dollar mic when I tell them. Such a fantastic price on this, can't beat it."
606,225,4.0,"I'm just getting into miking and recording music, mainly to get my son off to a good start. I'm kind of feeling my way. When I wasn't getting a good result from a dynamic mic, a friend suggested a pre-amp and/or a condenser mike. I ended up getting both (the AMP tube pre-amp) and running this through the AMP into my Tascam DP-008. WOW! I have to work on getting the levels matched properly, but this thing is just SO much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar. Our music sessions have slowed down a bit (he just turned 16, so hanging with the Old Man is the LAST thing on his mind, LOL), but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable. Includes a nice hard plastic carry-case, too. For this kind of money, you can't really go wrong."
423,225,4.0,"For the money, this mic performs very well. It is very sensitive, I can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic. If you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room. I also put a pop filter on it. I've only had it a day, so I'll see how it does in the long run."
945,225,4.0,this is my first real recording microphone. I really like it.  I use it to record vocal with my home studio setup and it does a good job
448,225,3.0,"After reading all of the reviews here and around the Internet, I took a chance since this is my first professional-level microphone. I'm glad I did because it's really great.One thing you will need, though, is a phantom power unit. I wish I could remember which one I got here on Amazon (I think it was about $25-$35) but it worked great. Excellent sound quality, much better than any other mic I've used."
318,225,3.0,"[Later: The mic is indeed the Behringer C-1, but Amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the C-1U.  Unlike Amazon's description, this is not a mic that comes with USB plug, phantom power, and computer connectivity. And, of course, none of the advertised ""included"" computer software programs is included.  It's a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp / P.A. with an XLR jack and phantom power. It will NOT connect to the USB port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power.  Moreover, Amazon's form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement--presumably for another mic just like this one! If you want the described mic, Amazon is showing it from a different vendor--at about 30 more plus S&H.;]The Behringer C-1 mic is the best condenser mic I've used for the money, its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly, high-end mics at the radio station (NPR) where I occasionally work.  However, Behringer makes a distinction between the C-1 and the C-1U.  The description on Amazon fits the C-1U, not the C-1.  So one way or another, 50% of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed.Indeed, the C-1U is a phantom-powered mic that doesn't require phantom power, which it derives from the USB port of a computer.  Moreover, the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre-amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly (and time-consuming) XLR to USB adapter.  It's ready to go--just plug it into your laptop and start recording.  (I use Sound Studio, but the included free software--Audacity--works practically as well.)On the other hand, if the mic is a C-1 as advertised, be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic, with an XLR connector and a phantom power requirement (found on numerous recording devices and P.A. amps or available on a neat little pre-amp sold by Amazon, the A.R.T.).Having just returned a keyboard--the M-Audio Pro88sx--for which Amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description (for the M-Audio Pro88, not the Pro88sx), I'd be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive--the C-1 as advertised, or the C-1U as described.  At least if you're purchasing directly from Amazon instead of a sub-vendor, you can be assured of a hassle-free return.  And if the mistake is due to Amazon's description, returns are generally postage-free."
209,225,4.0,"This microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received. It is very well made equipment, which is readily apparent to a total sound equipment novice like myself. The item as pictured looks different from what I received; it is not the all lighter gray plastic looking body base, it's more of champagne color and is metal and the screw on adapter on the bottom is black (heavy duty plastic). Not sure why the picture is showing that is, because the actual microphone I received is much more impressive looking.I was initially looking to spend ~$125 on a simple home recording setup using my iMac. I ultimately spent about $135 because I moved to a Behringer mixer board that can convey the appropriate power to a condenser mic like this one.For those who are starting out with recording, I recommend this microphone and a quality XLR cord and you will not be disappointed with your results."
468,667,4.0,"I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product, but they got these right... I replaced a way-more expensive Audix condenser mic with these, and they actually sound pretty darned good. If I crunch one or if one breaks, I'll just get more at this price. I have other Behringer mics laying around, and they all kinda suck. These are totally fine."
614,667,4.0,"These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand.  They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp.  I'm using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later.  The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a set.If you do stereo recording, you can't go wrong with these - their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear.  It sounds great, and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away, rain drops comming down, and sounds you never would hear.Note:  NEVER get these wet - you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain.You will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar, but you already know that."
415,667,4.0,"These are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work. I'm using them in our drum room, one is on hi-hat and one is on a small cymbal. They have a smooth un-hyped sound.The mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box. I have used them in an X-Y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural.Some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of $1200 each so I am aware of what &#34;expensive&#34; microphones sound like, these perform &#34;up there&#34; with the expensive mice while being bargain priced.Good music to all."
1107,680,4.0,2 15&#34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet. These hold up great year round. I will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand...
1247,680,4.0,no problem...it came today like the computer said it would... the box was mint...to my surprise there wasn't even any tape on it... I opened it ... pulled it from its plastic sleeve and set it up on about a minute it was holding a speaker cab...thanks again Amazon....and why would I shop any where else?
1127,680,3.0,"It is lighter than most, fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy 15&#34; speakers.The material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging 4-6 times a week."
956,680,3.0,"It's a cheap speaker stand. Heavier, in terms of weight, than I thought it would be. Cheaply made, the safety pin is kind of a joke. Overall though, it'll do the job. I would not use this at the highest height setting, but one or two notches lower, else it starts leaning."
1405,680,2.0,"the knobs seem very easy to over tighten, I haven't done it yet but I'm planning on treating this stand with the utmost care so as not to have any surprises when I put my expensive PA speaker on it"
1322,680,4.0,"If you have really large or heavy speakers, you might want to consider professional grade stands, but these will work fine for any speakers under 35 lbs. or so (maybe more, if you keep them lower down).  They look nice, and are easily worth their selling price.They do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers, so you'll have to figure out what you need, and buy those things separately."
1242,519,4.0,"theres the snark for clipons, the blackout or boss tu-2 for pedals, or a rack option. my pre-amp unit has a tuner but i love these for tuning off stage or something. got at least 3 of these around, i can use this for bass or guitar (i tune to low drop f and it even picks it up on bass)"
98,519,3.0,"The tuner is great  -  seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease. my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back, doesn't hold it at an angle that i find very usable.  otherwise? a fine product that i expect to last for years. korg makes great tuners. i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus. if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen, i'd replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models."
1132,519,4.0,"I don't use the other features, but as a tuner, this product is spot on.  Filters out noise well when using the mic.  Only two things to gripe with - 1.  The leg that you can use to prop this up isn't very usable. and 2. It's not great for gig use as the screen isn't that readable.As a home tuner or for a brightly-lit gig - excellent!"
888,519,4.0,"Works well.  It can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically.  I find myself using it a lot.  Even as I learn the notes on the guitar fret-board.  If I guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note.  I also use it to intonate my guitar.  It has some other advanced features, but I haven't need them.  Display is nice and large even though I still need my reading glasses to see the note."
786,519,4.0,"It is always a delight nowadays when any electronic device is still functional after such a long time.  From 2006 when I bought it, till 2013 when I write this, still going strong, very happy with my purchase.  Alas, my experience says newer devices being sold are rarely as good as when they first come out, but you never know, it may still be as good as ever now.For what it's worth, I am a professional musician with perfect pitch."
1256,519,0.0,"I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.The main problem with this tuner is the usability.The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be."
44,519,3.0,"I sent this to my grown daughter for her birthday and she has been very pleased with the product. I have three tuners myself and I find the Korg to be portable, easy to use and easy to read. Battery life appears to be adequate. Oh, and not to forget...accurate. Shipping was faster than advertised. A ""thumbs up for this one"". Amazon comes through again on price and product."
125,519,3.0,My only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see.
270,519,4.0,"I've owned several inexpensive Korg lcd tuners over the years. Like all of the others, this one is excellent, reliable and durable. I keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs."
548,519,0.0,"This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input."
585,809,0.0,"I've been very disappointed with this tuner. When I've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them.  I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG."
542,809,4.0,"I have tried several different brands/types of tuners in my 13 years of playing. I have found that this model fits my needs perfectly. It quickly detects the tune, dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs, and is extremely accurate. It also has options to tune flat, sharp, guitar, bass, etc.It is also small and portable. I have one in EACH of my 12 guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pockets/pouches perfectly. I cant recommend this tuner enough.As always, please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin'"
587,809,4.0,"The quality and feel of this tuner is very good. Tuning the guitar is really easy, just put the batteries in (it comes with 2 AAA batteries) and press the red button to turn it on, then pluck the strings! This is my first tuner and its great already! It's very portable."
144,809,4.0,This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner.  The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though.  But maybe that saves on battery life.  I don't know.  It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking.I'm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitar/bass and not the chromatic one.
648,809,4.0,This was the easiest tuner I had.  I am sorry I gave it away now when I upgraded.  LOL
337,809,4.0,Wonderful to use - as soon as I put the batteries in and started even without reading the directions - easy
1283,809,0.0,"There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using ""F"" or ""C"" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere."
771,809,4.0,Bought to tune my bass. Works fine and at the this price it cant be beat. Highly recommend for budget tuner.
1199,809,4.0,"It works beautifully. Arrived on time as promised as expected it is durable and it is easy and accurate as well, is as described."
128,809,3.0,Had to return the first one.  Second is holding it's own.  Just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic.  Spot on when used correctly inline with cables.
391,809,4.0,I AM SELF TAUGHT GUITAR FOR ABOUT 15 MONTHS.  WITHOUT THIS I WOULD BE LOST.  I WORK WITH A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED GUITAR FOR 30 YEARS.  HE TUNES IT TO ITSELF .  WHEN I HAD HIM TRY MY TUNER HE FOUND THAT HIS GUITAR WAS TUNED TO ITSELF YET SO FAR  OFF.  FOR $15 YOU CANT BEAT THIS.  DON'T BE SO CHEAP. BUY THIS AND ENJOY IT!
737,479,4.0,I always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal.  Never had such colorful ones though :)  If you need picks do the math.  It pays. ships fast as always.
1111,479,4.0,"Fender Heavies, what more needs to be said?  Great price for the quantity.  Just buy it so you don't have to worry about losing a pick or storing extras around various places."
1423,479,4.0,I love these picks. I buy tons of them all the time. If you are like me and prefer to just strum tunes on your acoustic then these are the picks for you. I prefer thin picks for basic strumming as I am a beginner guitarist and they are more forgiving.
367,479,4.0,i bought these because i couldn't see spending $4.50 a dozen at the local music store. I figure 12 dozen will last me for years. Get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like I can easily do.
630,479,4.0,These are the best celluloid shell-colored thin picks around.  Tried all the off brands but came back to Fender picks in the end.
633,479,4.0,I have used Fender Thin 351 picks for 40 years but always in either solid black or swirl brown. These picks are great because when you drop them on stage or in a dark club you can find them easily.
519,479,4.0,"I started using the confetti picks years ago, when I used to occasionally drop my pick.  No matter what color the floor/carpet/stage is, you can find your pick easily.  No lost picks.I like the extra heavy picks.  They suit my playing style well.  I don't have to wait for it to snap back, It doesn't bend. They don't break, either, although they do wear down over time.KMC Music Inc shipped fast and I got free shipping.  When I buy a gross, I only need to buy picks about once every 7 years.I would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick!  Thank you KMC Music Inc for fast shipping!"
11,479,2.0,These picks break way too easy.  I only play a few times a week but they dont seem to last long when playing for more than a few hours at the time.
1275,479,4.0,"Great heavy picks, amazingly cheap price.  You really can't go wrong.  I lose my picks continually (Bermuda Triangle in my Laundry?), and this has been great to have an endless supply..."
1312,339,4.0,"Nice bright and full sound. Good life, they sound good for a couple of months. Inexpensive. Fast delivery. I am happy with this product."
87,339,4.0,"Guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic.  And I'm sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient.  Even so, D'Addario has provided a consistent product for more years than I'll readily admit to knowing. I've used may other brands, but I seem to always return to D'Addario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars."
908,339,3.0,These strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips...They are very light to play and make my practising easier whille Iconcentrate on building callouses  ; )
170,396,2.0,even though i ordered large...still not fitting...will do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fit...i do not have giant hands so large should fit...but not this...very well made...heavy if thats what your looking for...arrived on time..but...good luck
75,396,3.0,"This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well. Try one...............I think that you will love it, if that's what you're looking for."
242,396,4.0,"After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a Dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for ""Spanish style"" playing), I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide.  It's probably a personal issue, but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide.  The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide.  The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control.  This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it.  The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses.  Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I drop it.  In short:  it's a winner."
379,396,4.0,"When they say small, they mean small.  I had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger, and my hands are not large by anyone's standards.Find the same slide in Large, and I wrote a complimentary review there."
356,424,3.0,Got them today and put them on a Wasburn X series.  Nice sound. I would recommend these to anyone. An inexpensive but nice set.
521,424,4.0,"Sounds and feels nice. I have an entry level guitar, a Peavey Rockmaster. It came with entry level strings. These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument.Be advised, the low E string is thick. When I try to depress the 12th fret, I can't get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger. Well, sometimes the pinky is needed to do that. Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game."
490,424,4.0,"I have used the EXL115W set for years.  Nice to have the whole set again.  Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third, and then have to find the wound third in a single string.  Not fun.  I like the sound of the wound third.  I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers.  No more thick calouses on the fingers.  Playing weekinds and practicing, they last a long time with the same sound quality."
368,424,4.0,"They have a nice thick sound, bright enough to be clear, good mids, nice bass notes, clear trebles. I like em."
67,424,4.0,D'addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as I can remember.  This guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars.
358,251,4.0,"It is very easy to apply, great results and very little effort. I'm surprised by the results. Never got this shine in my guitar with any other product."
170,251,3.0,this is great stuff....only problem...no order...i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture...this works fine...smooth slick finish...yes...guitar slips a little off my knee...but very happy just wish had sometype of order...yes..nice order..tks
350,251,4.0,"First wax I have bought. I usually don't wax. I tend to use cleaning sprays. I am going to be waxing now on. Gerlitz makes this wax easy, not greasy. This tin should last a lifetime. It comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars. I would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze. Leaves no ffingerprints or smudges. My classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the GERLITZ GNO NO 1 CARNUBA GUITAR WAX!!!!!"
137,251,4.0,"I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time.I've used Carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove.There were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface. They were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them. Not a sufficient defect to return the instrument.Another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal. I have open tuning machines, and before applying Tri-Flow with a pinpoint applicator, I used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel. The chrome is gleaming. They're really beautiful. Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed. Also got the tuning pegs. This is a 000 - OM acoustic. Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (I used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me."
1304,251,4.0,"I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars I've been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles. I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax, you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also. I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply.Along with a few high end guitars, I also have a few beaters. I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic. fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great.I use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly, I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease. I will buy this stuff again and again, my local guitar shop sells this for the same price."
1261,511,4.0,"I really feel like this thing is my personal slave, just standing off to the side, waiting to grab my guitar when I hand it off. It is reliable and rock solid. The tripod base has been very steady so far. It really is a great product.The other thing I have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the RIGHT places. I bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material. And it did, but not at all the guitar contact points.I do have to laugh at the folks here and on Musician's Friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1. ""It ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward."" - The basic idea is their guitar was on-stage, someone pushed the stand forward, the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground, releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor. REALITY: Let's say the stand held onto the guitar. It still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar. Sometimes accidents happen. Don't blame the stand. Blame the moron who knocked over your guitar.2. ""The guitar touches the floor."" - It's not supposed to! Try elevating the next, or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar.This stand is worth the extra money over those $15 disasters. Spend an extra $10 and save yourself the headache."
267,511,4.0,"The absolute best guitar stand made. Strong, and durable. I bought one about 4 months ago, and just ordered a second. Hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands."
269,511,4.0,"The stand is very well constructed and very stable.  The other stands that I have used were all bottom holders.  I was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder, but then again..all guitar stores display their guitars with them...so I thought ... lets have a go,  I'm glad I did.  My stand doesn't tip over like the others.  You just have to lift up before you take your instrument out.  The fingers in front hold the instrument in... lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument."
14,511,4.0,"I use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed  . I also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it, Breaks down to a reasonable size for transport."
340,511,4.0,"My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up smaller, but otherwise this is an excellent stand. I have to concede I'm a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myK & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand. However that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build. The extra heft of the Hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand (the K&M; tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor). Despite not folding up quite as small, the Hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust (one action for legs, one action for height, whereas the K&M; has three separate legs and two vertical sections / clamps). I do realize that I bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the K&M.; Length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the K&M; (large enough that I won't try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as I do the K&M;).I'm also not convinced Hercules' trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand. The back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it's knock the whole stand over. No big deal, just more parts (and weight). I think I prefer K&M;'s yoke, as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied. The Hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting ""gates"". Both work perfectly well with my Fender and similar bass head stocks.I've had two of the K&M;'s and the second was a bit of a disaster. It was defective in more than two areas. Defects happen, but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit, and lead me to try the Hercules(I won't go into all of that here, see my review on that product). Aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke, the Hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness. I'm glad I purchased this one and I think I'll get plenty of use from it. But I should mention, it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the K&M;, mainly its awesome portability (despite its slightly more fragile nature).In the interest of further comparison, I've got anUltimate  GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Standon order, and will review it against this and the K&M; as well. I opted for the GS-100 without an automatic closing mechanism over the GS-1000 which has one for the reasons I stated above- I don't believe it is strictly necessary. The reviews of the GS100 are also more favorable, and the GS100 is cheaper (which suits my cheapness."
1001,511,4.0,"I've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so I've gone through plenty of guitar stands.  Always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure.  For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand.  When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend (Christ Community Church, St Charles, IL), I decided to give them a look.  The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (Electric or Acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting.  It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it.  This is the only type of stand I prefer to use.  I do wish it wasn't made in China, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion).  The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever."
1304,511,4.0,"I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul. I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules. The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs. There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands. I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues. I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar. I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place.I strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment. I bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was there.UPDATE 11/5/12- A few weeks ago, I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers. I usually buy locally, but the deal here was great. The stand is worth the price and more."
1335,511,4.0,This is hands down the best guitar stand on the market. It will last a lifetime and never drop your axe. I have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and I love them all!
435,511,4.0,"I had been leery about leaving my Fender 5 string Custom Jazz bass on guitar stands until I met the Hercules GS414B.  The stand is ""built like a tank"" with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly.  My bass weighs about 9.5 pounds with the strap and with its long neck, fits perfectly in the Hercules, with the body of the bass resting  well-balanced against the padded legs.The design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and I experimented with trying to tip the bass over. It will take more than  an ""accident"" to tip the bass off its stand.  The self-closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock.The lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism.  The lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand.My only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism. I would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black."
1372,91,4.0,I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. I'm hoping they last a while!
412,91,4.0,"I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin, and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings.  I put these on, and what a difference.  These aren't too heavy, not too light.  They ring nicely.  I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings."
1359,91,4.0,I am using these strings on an inexpensive A-Style Beginner's Mandolin; these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument; I strongly recommend these strings.
9,91,4.0,Quality strings at a very affordable price.  They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product.
589,733,4.0,"I am learning to play the guitar. I needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound. I debated between this one and the other popular/slightly more expensive one. I cannot speak to that one's assembly process, but I found this one to be reasonably simple.I also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raise/lower it. The same goes for tilting. It is a superb stand with ample table space for book, iPad, capo, some picks and if you are creative, headphones. I love it and I am using it almost every single day. Very solid construction and the stand with the most height I could find.Go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered. As of today, this is the one that wins in the height, shelf and space categories."
923,733,4.0,"I think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class.  Yup, it is.  I would buy again.  My use is to hold my books while I try to teach myself how to play guitar.  This stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about 2+&#34; high.  Very happy with it.Just a warning to those that are picky.  Because of the way the tube locks together, the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it.  Not an issue for me, but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and won't move.It would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy.  Buy it, you'll like it.  It will survive a nuclear blast."
591,733,4.0,"This is the stand you remember from the band room. Effective, and built like a tank. You will need a wrench to assemble (a very simple task). One note - the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring, invest in the optional foot covers if you're concerned."
131,733,4.0,"this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars, this will last a life time, and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily,,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash,, so i looked for something better and ,i am so happy to have found this , at this price.i didn't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand ,but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash ,i would be buying another one , so really ,this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you can't go wrong with this one,,,REALY !! get it !  it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over,its heavy enough not to, it slides up and down nicely, and the book shelf  tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well, .,bolts are NOT plastic,witch is nice,,and very easy to put together and fast,,i got it together in one minute,i only used regular pliers to put it together..  the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument,i truly recommend this for anyone  ! (i did get the foot guards for $1.95 to protect floor, on carpet you will not need them ,)and it comes with a 10 year warranty ,and with the free shipping you can't beet it,"
509,733,4.0,"I read the reviews with low stars, the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head. We use it to hold the musics and don't need to turn the head. The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too, if they turned, they could not fit into the music stand rack. This one work great for us.We have several music stands,  we didn't like them not because the heads can't be turned but they are unstable and can't hold thick book."
1081,153,3.0,"Good cheap basic metal slide, sounds like it should. Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands (viz XL and XXL gloves) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger. A bit annoying but not the slide's fault I guess!"
1326,153,3.0,"For the price, i'm really happy. It's my first one i get and it's perfect, i'm learning how to use it and it's not as easy as you guys think."
1105,153,3.0,"I lost my trusty slide and really miss it. The Dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but, it does sound sweet. If it was just a bit smaller diameter, that would do the trick. My old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so, a brand-new, sleek fit isn't a plus in my case. The Dunlop is well made, as expected. It's just not the Antiques Roadshow model I had in mind. Hmmm, might be a new product idea - rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name."
1204,153,4.0,"I am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide.  this one works fine so far.  it is rather heavy and I like that.  I also like that because it is metal, if you drop it on the floor, it is not going to break like my glass one did.  Be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however.  otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger."
269,153,4.0,"Sweet ""twangy"" sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars.  I have a ceramic and this steel slide.  Each has a unique sound.  The steel as expected has more of brighter twang.  When I change my strings, I know that I'll get some differences in tonal quality, but hey, experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys."
292,153,4.0,Make sure you order the right size! I don't use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings.
217,153,4.0,"Fast delivery, and exactly as advertised.  Put it to work making music within minutes.  The steel gives a clearer sound than the glass  bottle slides,  but you need both.  Good product."
1080,153,2.0,I did purchase 3 diferent slides this one is mark as a medium but is diferent size from the other one's what I ordered. Perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size . This is why I give only 3 stars because is to small for me.
250,153,4.0,"Great sounding slider for my electric AND it won't shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do. Plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action. It has a great sound for the modern electric guitars, but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances. I recommend."
446,153,4.0,"I have several different slides (glass, brass, steel, short, long, etc.)And this has become my go to for every slide guitar session I play on!I wear it on my ring finger, It fits great, the tone is amazing on acoustic, electric and banjo!Works great for blues, rock, a little stoner country, and even some metal! (the main genres I play in)Harmonics and sustain to spare!I keep it in my pocket at all times now, it goes with me everywhere, And has never failed to lay down some mojo when I bring it out!"
590,870,4.0,"I love these picks, especially in this gauge. They are a bit thinner than the jazz 3s, so if you master em, you can in theory, play faster ;) They have a good grip, and a nice texture. The tone it gives isn't bad either."
664,870,3.0,Black Tortex picks with silver lettering.The Jazz picks are about 25% smaller than standard Tortex picks and have a more pronounced point.
301,870,3.0,"Nice picks, much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks. I prefer the jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s are warmer sounding and wear resistant. but these pitch blacks are not bad. They do wear down quickly but a dozen should last a good amount of time.  This pick does what jazz picks are suppose to do and in my university's jazz ensemble the three tips are useful and makes playing difficult jazz chord  easy. It will feel awkward at first if you never used jazz picks but once you get the hang of it you'll never go back to standard picks."
618,870,4.0,If you like Jazz Guitar picks and if you like Tortex picks this is the perfect marriage.  These are the best.  Enjoy.
319,470,2.0,I like them but I love the Schaller locks more. They don't feel as secure as the Schaller locks. Sorry
170,470,3.0,i really like these...use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on..  the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it...but once you got it its a fine product..enjoy
1411,470,4.0,These are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine I've always been a huge fan of Jim Dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come
533,470,4.0,This system does not fail. Install it and you never have to worry about it again. Although it's a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while. I put these on all of my guitars!
272,470,4.0,I use these on all my guitars.  Love them.  Easy to assemble and use.  If you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  Once installed they are fantastic.
495,470,4.0,"Here's what strap locks are supposed to do: securely attach your strap to your guitar. These do that much better than Schallers and the Fender rip-offs of Schaller.I used the Schallers many years ago. They look great, but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut. I am very good with maintenance, check for loose parts, etc., but at one gig with my super heavy American deluxe 5 string jazz bass, the nut worked its way off the strap, and I dropped it. It was with a heavy leather strap, and I did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and I'm sure I kept it maintained. Absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Never again. Unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig, forget about Schallers. They're a good company and they make great tuners, I don't fault the materials, it's simply that threaded things can work their way loose, a fatal design flaw for this type of device. Come on, its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else.The Dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring. It is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident. If you're having trouble getting the lockrings on, I have a YouTube video posted to my channel, NickWeissMusic, just search for Dunlop strap lock installation. It's kind of tough at first but with experience, it's very easy. The package instructions are correct but not very helpful.I have these on more than 10 instruments, and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade. The package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock, but I have never done so, in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this. I've never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks, if I did, I'd probably just replace it. I do give the locks a little tug when I put them on to make sure they're engaged, other than that, you can forget about them, which is the way it should be.The only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the Schallers do, to which I say, who cares. Well, I guess a lot of people care about that, since I see it in a lot of reviews. If using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you, just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar, so be it. I have seen Ernie Ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile, I think they use lock rings too. Maybe try those, but I'm sticking with the flawless track record of the Dunlops."
135,470,2.0,A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak.
904,244,4.0,"Iv'e tried a lot of thumb picks( i use them for bass) you no what that doe's to them,these are the one's i'm staying with these thumb's."
1342,244,4.0,"I've been using National medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke.  Decided to try the Dunlop.  Overall - I'm very pleased with this pick.Previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the National mediums.  This is true, but isn't a complete description.  Basically, the National picks are much more elongated - so while the nail to thumb-pad distance is about the same on both, the across nail distance is much greater on the National picks.  I actually find the Dunlop pick to fit much better, and I don't get extra overhang as with the National (which tends to catch the string)."
1235,244,2.0,"I wear a large sized glove, so assuming that would translate, I got these.  While I can force it over my thumb, it is very tight and uncomfortable (i.e., pinches).  My thumbs don't have a particularly excessive diameter either.  I'm gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit.  I know they need to be snug so the pick doesn't rotate when being used, but this is ridiculous.  Three stars because if they fit you, it is a nice pick (it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing)."
107,244,2.0,"These items, though well made, and strong, are sized rather differently to National picks - With the National, I need a Large, so I ordered Large in this item - it is, however very tight, smaller in fact than a National Medium thumb pick.Essentially a waste of money."
353,709,3.0,"I have a gibson les paul that I bought used. When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry. I first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood). So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey.I ordered it and applied it.  A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt. I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry. I decided to give it another 24 hours.The next day the guitar neck looked and played great. It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ. Bends and slides are smoother than ever.Great product and one that I will continue to use. If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly. But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation."
286,709,4.0,"This treatment, after I let it soak in for 24 hours, made my fingerboard look great and play fast. A little goes a long way!"
388,709,4.0,"As I mentioned in my review about guitar polish (already forgot what kind), I'm not really a guitar polish connoisseur, but this makes my fingerboards feel real good.  It got rid of that scratchy feeling when I bent strings, dissolved the crud, and makes the fretboard look just lovely.  It probably works as a fine hand conditioner too, but who can say.  Again, because I'm rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing, this bottle will also last me years."
542,709,4.0,I used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics. It was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do. Highly recommended
129,709,4.0,Works as advertised.  Makes the fretboard look and feel nice! I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you're changing your strings.
357,709,4.0,"I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics. They had mimimal oil/stain from the factory.  Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks.  I use it every other time I restring my guitars, It is a really good product, I use it on all of my guitars, except my Strat that has a maple neck.."
1304,709,4.0,"I bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after 2 uses, the wood looks great again. I used the honey twice in 2 days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition.This honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier. I saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after I bought this, but I do not use it much so it should last a long time."
596,709,4.0,"I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. I used this, and the color became rich and less dry. If your fret board is pretty dry, DO NOT remove the oil. Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. I love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. I didn't even notice a smell. I definitely would say this is a must-have."
228,709,4.0,"I requested this for Christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it. I've used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great. First I used it to treat clean fingerboards that were in good shape and it worked well. It can even make a big improvement to the dry, porous surface of a cheap fretboard, and good rosewood fingerboards love the stuff.Later on I got some used guitars and used cleaned the gunky fingerboards with Guitar Honey (apply it, scrub with toothbrush, wipe with paper towel, repeat) and it did a lot better than I expected at removing the yucky buildup next to the frets.I like to apply it fairly heavily and lay the guitar down with the fingerboard level and facing up, and give it time to soak in. You will notice that some areas soak it more than others. I move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly. Then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and you're ready to go.When I wipe down the strings after playing the first time or two after treating with Guitar Honey, the rag shows dark lines where the Guitar Honey cleaned the strings. I like making my strings last longer!Get some. I don't think you'll regret it."
59,709,4.0,"I have a lot of high end instruments, and I live in New England so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.This stuff is fantastic - MUCH better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. An hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. I apply it on occasion with the strings on (I use Elixirs) and have never once had a problem.The best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 Stars."
701,353,4.0,"Just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me.  WOW I love it.  The capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well.  I am using it with a Seagull Entourage mini jumbo.  It sounds divine.  It makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull, a nice mellow relaxed open sound.  Inspires my ears to make music.  Buy it."
841,353,4.0,This capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument!Highly recommended! Just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with!
503,353,4.0,I play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun.  That's all I can say.  It makes me creative and I have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this.  It's just fun.
833,353,4.0,"This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious."
309,353,3.0,"this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach"
340,214,2.0,"It'll do for setup work, and the price is right. I wouldn't recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song, its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set. I also wouldn't recommend it for anyone just starting out. A spring clamp type capo would serve better. This one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it, and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up."
85,214,2.0,"I bought the capo for the guys at a correctional facility that I work for. It gets abused, so I don't look for it to last long. Would not buy it for my own guitar."
90,214,3.0,"Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews:--I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything.--The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo."
787,214,4.0,"I prefer my spring loaded capo, but this one works ok on my guitars. I'm surprised I haven't broken it yet."
1326,832,3.0,"I got it today in the mail, and i already tried it. It's really cheap product but it works really well. I'm really happy with it and it made me save several minutes to change my strings."
166,832,2.0,This string winder is adequate but not really solid. It gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft. I had to glue the contacts on this thing since it gives way at times. This is just adequate for my use.
226,832,4.0,I hate winding strings. I got this to help with that. It does it job very well. You can string your guitar in a fraction of the time. It could be a little tougher but as long you don't give it hell it will be fine. Great and cheap product!
538,832,3.0,"Pretty simple tool, did exactly what I needed it to for a decent price. I'd order again if I needed another one!"
337,832,4.0,Nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar - very easy
1272,832,2.0,It is a nice smaller version of the 114SI Road Pro.It would be great if it had a steel shaft.The plastic shaft feels like it will break.But it is cheeep!
1321,832,2.0,"this makes winding strings MUCH faster, but it does feel flimsy, and the end piece doesn't fit over my tuing pegs correctly, so it's a bit of a haslle getting started. Other than that it's great for the price, but not a must have"
611,832,4.0,"I bought this cause i needed something to easily change the strings on my guitars. This thing works great. For the price you can't beat it. Maybe one day I might get the powered one but until then this thing will do. Fits in your pocket, gig bag, etc. So you can have this thing on the go. Works great and you can't beat the price."
788,832,0.0,"Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools."
87,832,4.0,"Jim Dunlop has produced these for more years than I'd like to admit to personal knowledge.  As long as I can remember, I've had one in my case and one on the workbench.  There are dozens of wannabe models, but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol' Jim Dunlop's.  I gotta remember not to get the black ones, though.  I seem to lose them to easily - or maybe they are really that good, and they just get 'borrowed'."
718,832,0.0,Ok its cheap. You knew that when you bought it. I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. It was only one and it was red. Broke with first use.
1132,332,4.0,"Dr. Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones.  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time."
263,332,3.0,"This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand.  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses.  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR. Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case.  The secret is always use the least you can get away with.  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever."
899,332,3.0,Use very little of this. Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off. It also lubes your strings. Good all around product.
1019,332,4.0,Does it all.  Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar; don't need a bunch of different items; this does it all.
898,570,3.0,"I dunno, cause I'm stingy with stars.  These have a nice sound.  I had an old guitar I bought for cheap at a garage sale for my son (8 at the time) to play on, but never really cared for it.  I finally got it out and started to tune it, but the steel strings broke.  SO I replaced with these.  It's a classic guitar, it shouldn't have had steel strings to begin with."
166,570,4.0,great sounding strings. you can hear the difference once it is used. i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance.
206,570,4.0,"These are really cheap strings but how they sound!! really good!! obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse, these are the ones!"
691,570,4.0,D'Addario strings have never failed me. These are so much better than the other nylon strings I used to buy where the ball end always broke. These strings sound nice and you can't go wrong with the price tag either.
53,570,4.0,"I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar, made in 1969,, for a few months,,, never change the strings,, and sounds great,,, I put this strings,, and wao,,know sounds wonderful,, few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change,, try,, this are the best"
332,570,4.0,"Restrung my guitar with no problems. These were my first set of new strings so I dont really know what to fuss about hen comparing strings but these seem to work fine and have a great tone. I can really hear the difference between new and old strings. The strings are nice and smooth, and springy, very easy to press on."
565,570,4.0,"These take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm. They made my Cordoba C5 sound like a more expensive guitar. Not overly bright, just a richer tone"
1133,570,4.0,I bought a cheap 3/4 guitar that sounded really bad.  I replaced the stock strings with the D'Addario strings and it made it sound much better.
430,570,3.0,Great prce
1115,570,1.0,"in the old days, we used tobe able to buyall 6 NYLON clear strings....now tis almost impossible....with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar....one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings...very nice, resonant, and clean...not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know...Again, like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUS>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTIC.This makes the move from the D to the G string too noticableCANT THEY EVEN MAKE  6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ?makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally...sucks bad now.oohthanks man"
776,570,4.0,I can't really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings.It sounds really good on my classical guitar. Will buy it again in the future.
55,570,4.0,"I've played guitar for some 35 years and have found D'Addario strings to be of consistently good quality.  They are one of maybe three companies I trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument.  Whether classical (nylon), acoustic (brass) or electric (nickel)... their strings produce excellent sound and are durable.Like any string, one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style.  That comes through reading reviews and quite often, simply testing.  But I've never played a set of this brand that I didn't like.  They always provide vibrant tonal quality.And no I don't work for D'Addario; just a long-time fan. : )"
656,473,3.0,I love these picks and the .88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing.
317,473,4.0,"I am a LONG time user of the big Fender triangular picks.  I play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in Columbus, Ga.  I play mainly a Martin HD-28, but also have a Blueridge BR-180 and a Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce.  I bought a set of these to try them out.While I have nothing negative to say about these picks, I still prefer my big Finder's.  I guess I'm just too used to the big pick.  While I was playing Katy Daley with one of these Tortex picks, I found that my index finger was hitting the strings, on occassion.If you haven't been tainted for the big Fender picks, then try out a set of these.  I guess I could get used to them, but will stick with the big Fenders for now."
30,473,4.0,These are my favorite picks to play with.  The Dunlop Tortex Picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic.
207,473,4.0,These are excellent guitar picks.  They don't slip in my fingers like the Eddie Van Halen guitar picks I purchased a while back.
618,473,4.0,"Tortex picks are the best.  Pitch black is so cool.  1.0 mm is the perfect thickness.  Don't buy those other picks, buy these because Tortex ... Black .... 1.0 mm is the perfect combination."
365,473,4.0,"If you have not used Tortex picks before, I highly recommend giving them a try.  They are NOT flimsy plastic that cracks and splits like most of the tortoise shell picks you see.  These are much more flexible so they last forever.  The only reason I've ever needed to get a new one out of the package is because I lost the one I was using...Just be aware that 0.50mm is really light for most players.  They do sell these in many different thickenesses and colors, so give order a few different ones to see what you like.  My favorite is the 0.70mm...  it has the perfect balance of flex and strength."
701,263,3.0,"I sprayed on all my guitars.  No problem with any chemical reactions.  It polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new.  Now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice.  It must be from a product like this.  They seriously look brand new.  Makes nicks and scratches less noticeable.  If you want a nice looking guitar for the stage or display, this stuff works."
6,263,4.0,"Used this on my mandolin and it brought back the new instrument sheen it had lost months ago. I sprayed it on a bit of cheesecloth, used that to rub the instrument down, then wiped with a soft Chamois, worked like a charm."
1135,263,4.0,"I love the Dunlop Formula 65 polish and cleaner. It works really well, and I like the easy to use pump spray mechanism. I've used other brands in the past, and they had poor spray nozzles. This one works almost like a mist. It does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints. I spray it directly on the surface of the guitar, and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth. After I'm done the shine looks glassy and great!"
286,263,4.0,"It has a pleasant smell to it, not harsh at all. A little goes a long way. My guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65. nothing to complain about."
388,263,4.0,"I can't say I'm a polish connoisseur, but this stuff seems to work very well.  It shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks.  I'm not very diligent in my guitar maintenance, so this bottle should last me for years."
542,263,3.0,"Dunlop 65 cleans the smudges and fingerprints off, but I dont know how well it actually polished. I like it well enough, just make sure you have a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching the lacquered surfaces."
332,263,4.0,"I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion, sweat, fingerprints, dust, what have you; I take some of this, spray it on a cloth, give it some elbow grease, and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made. I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars. The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine. I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back. It has a fresh lemon scent. I recommend this to everyone, a lot of product for an affordable price."
419,263,4.0,Very nice polish! I have thirteen guitars and I would like to keep them all looking as great as they were new! Gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop! Use it on everything!
168,263,4.0,"Friend of mine has been playing/cleaning/modifying guitars for some 30+ years and this is what he recommended I use on my guitar to clean it.  Who am I to argue with him, he's used them all and said this was the best.  Easy to use - a little goes a long way, works very well and shines up nice.  He was right - great product!"
372,263,4.0,"The standard for mild, non-oily instrument cleaners. Leaves no residue, easy on old guitars' finishes. I have used it for years."
805,263,4.0,Item arrived on time and as described.  My son loves this polish/cleaner.  He likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny.  They glisten when he uses this to polish them.  Great product!
92,263,3.0,"I was looking for a cleaner and a polisher to get the grease and grime off my guitars. I decided to trythe Dunlop Formula 65 Polish & Cleaner. I thought, why not try a 2 in 1 formulation? After all, thereare shampoo and conditioners in one bottle, and that works well for me. So why not this? Possiblyfaulty logic but I went with it at the time.Well I have to say that it did well. I used a soft cotton cloth, placed some Formula 65 on the cloth(Not the guitar) and slowly worked on the more oily looking areas of my Gibson ES-339. This guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish. The Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner did a very good job on thefinish and did not leave any streaks behind.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was after using the substance all over the guitar that I realized that one must not get Formula 65in any cracks or chips. I am thankful that I did not have any of said cracks or chips. I am usually oneto read directions thoroughly; but not this time. No harm done but I will make it a point to inspect myguitars for cracking or chipping prior to using Formula 65 again.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This stuff works well. It was able to lift off, with some effort, greasy build-up over the last year. I amnot a messy person but oily hands can and often leave smudges that mar the surface of the finish. Notonly does it clean up the oils from my hands and gosh knows what else, it also left a nice shine as well.The finish looks very good. This 4oz bottle will go a long way. It doesn't take much to work.I tried using an untreated micro-fiber polish cloth and that only pushed the oily mess around. That iswhen I decided to get the Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner. It definitely worked a lot easier than the un-treated micro-fiber cloth. I am now using the micro-fiber cloth to rub off any new smudges as theyoccur. I plan to re-apply the cleaner/polisher when I oil my fret board a couple times a year.I gave the Formula 65 Cleaner & Polisher 4-1/2 stars due to the fact you can potentially do damage toyour guitar. Chips and cracks do occur throughout the course of a guitar's life and can be expectedalbeit not wanted. So 4-1/2 stars because it does what it says it will do but you've got to be carefulusing it. So...be careful out there people....NOTE: There is a ""California Propositon 65 Warning"" on the web page under 'Product Details'. Amazonhas placed it there as a public service. It reads: ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals knownto the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Just thoughtyou ought to know."
1037,263,4.0,"Up until a few years ago I had been using the same old brand I'd been buying for 20 years.  Then, I tried this recipe... Dunlop 65.  It is wonderful.  It does everything the product description tells you about.  Excellent cleaner on both wood (painted and natural) and metal.  I use it to clean not only the body, but the tuning heads and bridge on my bass guitar.  No nasty residue build up over time.  It cleans and polishes just like it was designed to do, without streaking and so on.  You'll like this stuff better than anything you've used to date....or at least I think so.  I sure do."
129,263,4.0,Spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth.  Shines nice and doesn't leave it feeling oily/sticky.  Smells nice and makes your guitar looking new!
1076,263,3.0,"This polish works well for what I need it for. I am not a clean freak but I take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig, but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there."
1294,263,3.0,I like this cleaner - it's gentle on my guitar finish and it doesn't smell bad either.
237,263,4.0,"My buddy used this for a long time so I thought I'd give it a try. Shines up guitars very nice. I use it every time I change my strings for a little zaz. It does It's job in fantastic fashion, but doesn't last the longest. The shine will fade soon enough, but looks great while it lasts."
673,263,4.0,This is the best guitar cleaner and polish I have ever used. It cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxy/greasy feeling that cream polishes leave. This is a must for black guitars. Great product. Only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz. It's quite expensive for 4oz. But 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck.
543,263,4.0,"This has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar?Going to also last for a long time, cause just a small amount goes a long ways."
627,263,4.0,"I have many acoustic guitars and I use this on all of them to keep them looking good. Easy to use, wipe on and wipe off."
1185,263,4.0,It really makes your guitar shine! Also I use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny. 5 stars. Also the price is right.
1423,263,4.0,"This is just an excellent product. I have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it, I will keep using it. You only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you don't need to use it for every polish. Once you put it on initially, you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back. There is enough in one bottle to last a very long time.I highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the Dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards. The lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well. When it dries, your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks. 50 stars."
1079,263,3.0,Puts on a good shine for your instrument.  I like the spray bottle applicator.  You can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings.
1300,263,4.0,I love this product! It is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar.  You end up using just the right ammount.  Would definately recommend it!
1418,263,4.0,"If there are still people out there who don't believe in magic, just try this. It has truly elevated my playing a few notches. I'd probably have bought another bottle already, but this one seems to be lasting forever! I've had it a few months now, I use it pretty much a few times everyday, and it still seems full.If after using this your playing doesn't improve, then maybe you should give up guitar."
763,263,4.0,"Nice Polish/cleaner  Really works very well on the finishes I have (cheap glossy chinese electrics, and a matte finish acoustic).  handy to have when your changing strings (to clean that nasty fretboard- wow do those things get dirty!) Pleasant scent (lemon oil), and no residue.  Lasts a long time (2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar."
1071,263,4.0,"Love this stuff, I have been using it for years and it always does the job well. Cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent. Cleans off grease, fingerprints, old beer and restores that sweet shine."
780,263,4.0,"I've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down.  I play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc., during a show. A couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish. I've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results.Tip: a little goes a long way. I play every week, I use this stuff every time I put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle.  I figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month.  :)"
202,263,3.0,"It's cleaned and polished pretty my Taylor guitar pretty well.  I would recommend this.  If not this one, at least buy some kind of cleaner/polish.  Protect your investment."
6,8,4.0,"I am just learning how to play the mandolin, one of the problems I was having was supporting the mandolin and fretting the notes, since I got this strap adjusted I no longer have to hold the neck so I can concentrate on the notes, I like the fact that you can unclip the strap at either end without touching the adjustments so I can put it into my case without having the strap laying across the neck, yet pick it up and with one click it is ready to play."
31,8,3.0,"There aren't enough uke straps out there for a good price.  This one is great.  I take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller, lighter."
747,8,4.0,"I had purchased a different strap for my F-style mandolin and it was adequate but when I learned of this Neotech strap and how adjustable it was I ordered it and tossed my earlier strap.  This should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well.  My only complaint is that the button hole doesn't stay on the end pin of my Epiphone mandolin.  I solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick I wasn't happy with, drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end-pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn't fallen off since (over 2 months of daily playing!)"
1359,8,4.0,"This is a good quality product as advertised, fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument! I am satisfied."
399,8,4.0,"It's definitely high-tech, but since I don't own a classic-looking or vintage mandolin, I don't really care about looks. My primary concerns are comfort and function, and this product gets five stars on both counts. I really like the fact that you can attach the contact points, and using the click-locks, remove the strap from the instrument while leaving the contact points in place. Also, if you get the strap twisted up while installing it, just undo the click-locks, take out the twist, and reattach it. Pure function! This strap was very well designed and thought-out before going to manufacture. Five stars!"
124,8,4.0,"As others have said, the stretchiness of this strap makes the instrument seem much lighter and I am less likely to get an achy shoulder when playing for long periods of time.  It may take a few tries with different configurations of the attachable/detachable extensions to get it just right for you and your instrument, but don't give up, it's worth the effort."
475,782,3.0,This is a good looking strap. Much lighter and thinner then any strap that I have had. It has to be half the weight of others but that makes it very comfortable.Looks great on my blond Tele.The price is right as well.I like it
782,782,2.0,"not your fender quality strap.  this is a cheap, extremely low quality strap.  I've had it for a few months and my guitar has not fallen yet, but I can see the wear on the end it's almost at breaking point.  I would not recommend it. It's ok as an emergency strap or to get you out of a jam, nothing else."
1388,782,2.0,"I decided to get this tweed strap for my 50s Telecaster Classic, but when it arrived, I was a bit let down. The tweed finish is cool enough, but the strap is very thin, and the strap ends are pretty poor quality. If they truly are made of leather, I feel sorry for the hide they came from. The leather is so hard, you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locks.This is decent for the time being, but I am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar. Feels like wearing a $10 Casio with a $1300 suit..."
24,782,4.0,"The tweed really grips on your shirt, the quality is perfection and they even give you a little string, if your using it for acoustic which I thought was sweet! Love fender."
518,782,4.0,I have three of these straps more my Strats. Very comfortable and durable. I really like the metal link as opposed to the plastic link which hold the strap itself to the the leather button hole. Great product!
296,782,3.0,For the price this is a pretty nice strap.  It's thin but does the job well. The simulated leather end pieces are noticeably &#34;cheap&#34; but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet :)
879,782,4.0,"Not much to say...I wanted  Fended tweed guitar strap and this is the exact item in my sights. Thanks, it does what it's meant to do!"
128,782,0.0,Sorry Fender...this one is just a waste of money.  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots.
368,782,3.0,"I have gotten comments on how cool it looks, I'm finding that I prefer a thicker strap, but this strap works perfectly"
6,485,4.0,"Unlike some other reviewers I have found no quality issues with mine, it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn't smell like anything, it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove, all I need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut, rotate the harp away from my mouth, and lift the frame over my head.To change out harps bite down on your harp, use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do, to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth, depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates, when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut."
808,485,2.0,"The harmonica barely fits the holder, and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica. I can't get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it, unless I modify it."
508,485,3.0,its cheap//it worx// what more to say?welp...only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it'd be perfect!!! (nope...i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt :Dblow-on bruthas n sistas!Doc P.
342,485,3.0,"I wish there was a fine pivot/angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth. I feel I have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how I set it up. I have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as I think I need it to - causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me. for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth ( LOL ).This is the least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013. Since it was inexpensive comparatively I will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews don't want it.Also not sure why they don't make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of Harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place, could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so. a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design."
0,485,4.0,I ordered both this one and the Lee Oskar.  I couldn't find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the Hohner had &#34;raised&#34; ends.  I reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok.  The quality appears good.  The springs that hold the harp in are STRONG but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands I can change harps without removing the rack.This was my first shoulder rack and I didn't know what to expect.  I have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and it's challenging but I can get it done.
1336,485,3.0,"This holder, and just about every holder I've ever bought, doesn't hold a harmonica at the right angle for me.  They all need one more joint to adjust the angle. I've had Hohner racks before so I was prepared.  I use harmonica holders for kazoos.  This one has a decent spring and may not require the use of duct tape or wire to hold the kazoo in place.  I may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic.  The angle for kazoo use is fine.Obviously not everyone's head and neck are the same as mine.  This holder may work well for harmonica for some people.  If you can, you should try on holders before you buy."
1034,485,4.0,"I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size. Great quality, lasts forever. You won't be dissapointed."
1258,485,4.0,"Great harmonica rack, for smaller harps.  Very strong in the set when worn.  A must have for any folk player."
1188,485,4.0,"This was the first time I ventured into the world of harp.I figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too.Fast shipping, no hassles.Thank you Amazon"
833,485,3.0,"I bought this in lieu of the more expensive Lee Oskar rack. I'm not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with. This rack is constructed better than I had really expected. It's easy to adjust. However, I found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward. Getting he harmonica unto te spring-loaded holder can be a bit tricky. Still, this is a good deal."
784,485,4.0,"This is an excellent product. I've used one of these before, and don't remember it having lock washers... this does. When you tighten this down, it actually stays tightened.For $10 you cannot go wrong with this. Bear in mind that it's for a standard 10 hole diatonic harmonica, not the 16 hole chromatic style."
798,485,2.0,"In case you're wondering about the difference between this Hohner harmonica holder and the Hohners costing more than twice this one's price, this one is made in China while the others are made in Germany. Now, I'm definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of Chinese made products. I have, in fact, many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there. This item however has some of the good, AND some of the more stereotypical problems of Chinese goods. Pros: Cheap. Sturdy. And unlike some reviewers, I love the taller height. Far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe. I also like the tighter springs, though that does take a little getting used to. But the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort. Now, the Cons: It's true what others have said: the plastic neck tube smells. Not as bad as some have said, but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable. I cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at TAP Plastics for a buck (make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee - I got the 1/2"" diameter). 2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is NOT bent evenly. Mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other, and the neck loop was WAY off. I did my best to bend all parts to even, but the flat metal part is tough to shape. The reason I didn't return it is that I figure most of them are equally uneven: I just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand, with little or no machine help to ensure consistency. With the work I did on it myself, it works fine and is now fairly even, and like I said, the taller height is just about right for me. It's just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren't met (like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides). All this said, the bottom line is that I prefer using this OVER my German made Hohner holder because it's better ergonomically (taller), holds my harp more securely, and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the ""nouveau"" single butterfly nut design of my more expensive German Hohner. Knowing what I know of its drawbacks, I'm still tempted to pick up another as a back-up or spare. It's a great deal if you're willing to do a little work on it."
446,485,3.0,"This is a good neck rack for gigging...It DOES  take a little tweaking and customizing to get it arranged right around your neck.But that goes for all neck racks really...Once it's fit to you though, It works beautifully! I use mine  daily and it hasn't failed me yet!Also, it will (with a little ingenuity)Hold a Kazoo, slide whistle and or humanaphone, I.E. ""nose flute""  (I do a ""one man band"" act sometimes...)"
1207,190,4.0,"Works great for the price!! I just started to get into pedals and I thought I'd try something cheap like this, and I was not dissatisfied. Don't mistake this for a distortion pedal for those who are new to all this, although you can get a distorted tone for this pedal, it just boosts the volume with slight raise in gain (For those who do know your shit please don't call me out on that, I don't really know and I'm just helping ones like me in simple terms,lol). It works great for switching to a more abrasive tone for solo'ing or just wanting to get loud in your songs.Definitely would pick this one up for a super cheap &#34;I just wanna try it&#34; pedal."
874,190,4.0,Great little pedal for a very reasonable cost. This pedal is durable too cause I have owned it for about two years and it has held up great so just because it is a little cheaper does not mean it is not a good pedal. Sounds great too.
173,190,4.0,"This thing sounds great with my tube amps, both with my 2 watt danelectro amp from 1962 with it's 8 inch speaker and my 12 watt excelsior from fender. It has a good range of overdrive levels. It is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lo-fi stuff like The Black Keys, The White Stripes, and garage band like stuff. It is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz. I love mine for the price, and its a good mix up compared to my modded SD-1 and my overdriven tube amps. It's different and just worth having to mess around with. Just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last. Also, the blue LED is very bright. Thats either an annoyance or great. Rock on!"
1395,190,3.0,"Depending on the amp and guitar you have, this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer. It sounds terrific with my fender strat (single coil) Danelectro (lipstick pickups) on my solid state amps, giving them a warm tube like overdrive.It sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp, it really sounds aweful with my 1980's Kramer, loaded with humbucker pickups.You'll either love it or hate it! That will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use, it's a different pedal with every combination."
1203,190,3.0,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-2 Overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues....  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is &#34; It tends to be a little noisey &#34;  if you turn the gain up too much.  You can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have.  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
134,190,3.0,"The FAB overdrive pedal does not work well for me. In fairness to the product, I was aware from reviews that it gives varying results based on guitar and amp. I have a Epiphone Les Paul Special II, with a Fender Frontman 25R amp. No matter how I adjust it, it has a muddy sound. I've heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results. I took a chance based on the low cost, and I do plan to do some upgrades to my guitar. The guitar is new, and has the strings that came with it. I plan to get a better grade immediately, and that may be all I need to get the expected sound. There are several reviews of this product on You Tube. You can do a search there, and hear what it is capable of."
918,729,2.0,"It's very small.  It's a fabric stretchy capo, the old type, that's quite difficult to stretch and make stay.  It's made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo, but the end isn't very long and I don't trust it to stay while playing for long.  I'll keep it as a spare, just in case, anyway."
142,729,4.0,Old tech bungee type of capo.  Inexpensive and works well.  You have to remember that banjos don't have a lot of tension on the neck to they really don't require a vice to get the job done.  Works well on Mandolin's too.
893,729,3.0,"I needed a small capo for my mandolin and so I purchased this little guy. Works great, though I have to put it on at that 1st fret and then move it up to where I need it."
993,729,1.0,"Don't know what I expected for such a cheap price, but this product's quality is in line with its price. Also, the fit over my ukulele's fretboard is very tight, making it hard to put on and remove."
310,314,4.0,"I have had this stand for over 2 years and still like it's compact transport capability.  Since I purchased mine, several other musicians have purchased the same stand.  It is well built, and can handle heavy music binders without tipping.  I've used it  at both inside and outside gigs without any problems."
1427,314,4.0,"A little large and not really light, but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way. Fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap. Very well made, although the bag is a little lower quality. Sturdy enough to hold a big binder, 300 page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable. Goes up and down and tilts back. No slippage."
67,314,4.0,"A friend of mine has used this stand for over a year, and I ordered mine due to the quality and durability I saw with hers.  Much smaller to carry and lighter than the metal one I had before.  A little small tray for large fake books, but overall a winner..."
497,314,4.0,"I bought this stand because I needed support for larger songbooks that my metal fold-up could not provide.  I really, really like it. Others in my music groups that have seen it have also gone out and ordered one.  It assembles quickly and easily, and folds up into a nice package for transport.  Every once in a while I have to tighten the lock cams, but that is no issue.  It is very sturdy and holds big music books very well."
851,198,4.0,"This little stand serves so many purposes for me..At home, it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when I want to test out different pedal configurations.At my gig, It holds my presonus mixer, A laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers..  It is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide AND Short or Tall..As well, I have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it..  I plan on using this one day to hold my Ableton Live machine as well as a small 2 octave keyboard and I will use the mic boom arm at that point!  Even as a keyboard stand, I like it because I can put pedals underneath it..  WIth it fully extended to &#34;Long&#34; mode, I can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it..  Of course, that is 54 solid inches of stage front though..  Which is indeed a lot for the small places I fit into with my duo.."
868,198,2.0,"This is certainly a heavy duty stand!  It weighs quite a bit, is made of solid metal, and I would not hesitate to think it could hold quite a bit of weight.  However, while it seems stable side-to-side, the spread of the legs does not taper much at all from top to bottom, and I believe it would fall over quickly if bumped from the front or back.  This makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices."
1425,198,3.0,"This is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88-key keyboard.  The front-back spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications, but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the more-common 'X' stand."
1297,198,4.0,"It's really flexible on how you're planning to put on top of it. The only small con is the top surface, you might wanna get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything. I put my guitar amp head (around 40lbs I think), and two monitor speakers without a problem. Love it!"
484,149,4.0,I bought a cheep violin to decide if I would like playing it and the pegs kept slipping. The peg drops really helped keep it in tune I wouldn't have been able to do it without the drops.
405,149,3.0,"Can't play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of Peg Drops.  Though I don't know why they don't put guitar type turners on violins, cellos and bases"
643,149,3.0,I have a 1918 Chezch Violin and it's sparked my 11 year olds interest. My pegs are in great shape but I figured I'd get this oil to make starting to play the violin easier on him.
412,149,4.0,"Got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin.  Added a couple drops, and it worked like a charm.  A must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin."
1250,149,4.0,"I was given a violin (fiddle) by my friend who decided they would never really learn to play.  The violin hadn't been used in quite some time so the pegs were really loose and wouldn't tune at all.  I got this product to see if I could fix the problem.  It worked just as it said it would.  A drop or two on each peg tightened them up enough to be able to tune the violin.Now that it's being played more regularly it's easier to tune, but know that if they pegs get loose again I have the product to fix the problem."
43,149,4.0,"Wow, this works!  At first, I was a little wary about using the liquidThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product.  Being my own bumbling teacher, there was a fear I could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument.  However, I needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs, so I closed my eyes and blundered ahead (that's just a figure of speech; for I was careful, using the stuff for the first time).  With care, cotton and a small rag (torn off my moth eaten underwear) I went ahead, willing to try anything.  I even removed the strings from the pegs (only one at a time - starting with the inner one first), put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string.  Tuning then became a breeze.  To think I used up a great glob of practice time, not fiddling, but tuning.  Bop! Could'a had a veggie drink!"
1121,149,4.0,"These drops are not just a convenience. In my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists. If you are reading this wondering if you should consider buying this product to stop your tuning pegs from slipping, or to make them turn smoother and in less dramatic tuning jumps, the answer is yes. Buy this, it does work, and it works very well.Even though the instructions said to put a drop on two different places on each peg, I wanted to go light just in case, so at first I only put 1 drop on each peg. I didn't know what to expect and you can always put more on, but too much could be a bad thing. Also, each instrument is different, each peg is different. I had one very stubborn peg, while the others were just the normal level of obnoxious about slipping. You may only need 1 drop on some pegs and the reccomended 2 drops on the others. I had new strings on, which of course are going to take forever to stretch out and will need constant tuning. I did not remove the strings, I just loosened the pegs a little and pulled them out a tiny bit, one at a time, then put the first drop on the spot where the peg would make contact when put back in (on the tuning head side of the peg, the part you actually turn). I put the 2nd small drop on the dead end of the peg (not the end you turn). Be careful when applying that you don't get more than 1 small drop at a time. This stuff spreads out over time, a tiny drop goes a long way. One bottle should last you a very long time.What to expect: With one drop the effect is immediate. You will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better. After playing for awhile I decided to put a 2nd drop on each peg (as suggested by the included instruction sheet). This helped them all to stay in place even better than before. The pegs now also turn smoother and easier and I can tune much easier than before, in smaller more accurate adjustments, and the strings actually hold the tuning for much longer than before.Great product. Buy it, use it, and be happy."
493,149,3.0,"My pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while, and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as I can remember. I'd guess they have about 100 years of wear on them.I used to be able to deal with it. Violin teachers and techs I knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem. More recently, I tried adding fine tuners on G D and A to make it easier to tune, but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much. I figured I'd give the drops a try.  The change was immediate. I was able to work with the pegs more easily, and slippage went away immediately. I decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings. When I did, I also removed three fine tuners and still had the control I needed.After changing one string, things worked well, but then I had the peg slip suddenly. I figured I'd try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault, but it ended up slipping loose again. I tried reapplying peg drops, and that seemed to fix the problem. After that, I had no more slippage, but I now have one peg that is binding.The instructions are clear but minimal and open ended. I don't expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect, what symptoms indicate, and so forth. I tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions, but never heard back.Suffice to say the drops made an incredible difference, but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure. I'd definitely recommend them, but I hope to get some comments from users with more experience so I can have a better idea what makes people know it's time to reapply and what they experience when they do it.The advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic (not metal core) strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners.  The effort I had without the drops made me avoid playing and I was using a Yamaha SV-120 most of the time. That can be fun, but I didn't realize how much I missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune."
1380,361,3.0,It has a tinney sound to it But for 200 dollars or less I would rate this has a Top of the Line low end guitar..For any beginner this is the guitar I would but in there hands..I still write all my songs on this and play it more then my !000 dollar american strat or 500 dollar ibanez
140,361,4.0,"I am disabled, a disabled Vietnam Vet, and my mobility is becoming more limited every winter.  My wife bought me this for Christmas, thinking I needed a new hobby to keep me busy during the harsh winter months.I am so happy she did.  My first thought was ""Now I have to learn how to play this thing"".  I am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with.  I now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars.  I always get carried away with new projects and can already play quite well, or so I'm told.  I practice a lot.Now about the guitar.  I wanted to wait until I knew a little something before I reviewed it.  First, I don't know how they sell these for the price they do.  It is a very high quality piece, comparable to guitars in the thousand dollar price range.The action is nice and low, good especially for a beginner.  I did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference.  I use light D'Addaro strings and love the tone and feel.The Yamaha is solid wood everywhere, no laminate as you'd expect for this price.  The tone is fantastic, the finish is flawless and tough.  It sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it.  I have been strumming vigorously for over four months now and not a mark is on the guitar.  I have been playing many other guitars, all electric as well and am looking at a high end acoustic now, but will always keep my first.  There is no reason for me to need another acoustic, I just will because I can.This Yamaha has great tuners and stays in tune well, rarely having to make an adjustment once the strings are stretched.The neck is nice, though a bit thick so I cheat sometimes with my thumb on the low E.  The set-up was perfect with this and I just can't see where it's going to take much if any maintenance over the years other than replacing strings as needed.The Yamaha came with a great hard case, tuner, pics and other goodies as a package and was very inexpensive.  I did put a nice soft leather strap with a quick disconnect on it as there is no front strap button but no big deal there.If you're looking for a nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing, this would be a great place to start.  I see these selling used for what I paid for mine new so you're bot going to lose money on it either.  Read the other reviews, this is a really nice value.  It is still my only acoustic that I own, my other 25 guitars are all electrics or project guitars.  I do have my eye on a Martin though.5 PLUS stars for this one.  If you're considering it, buy it.  You will not regret it.  I still play this on almost every day."
261,361,4.0,This guitar is probably one of the best I have ever owned. The tone is near perfection and it has pretty decent stock action and strings. You might need to adjust the neck a bit and some new strings probably wouldn't hurt but my god! What an amazing guitar!
1244,361,4.0,"For under $200, I'm amazed at how nice this guitar is!  First, it was perfectly playable right out of the box - all I had to do was tune it.  And it stays in tune nicely too.I did replace the strings shortly after getting it.  There was nothing wrong with the original strings - no rust and they sounded fine - I just wanted something softer so I put on Dedario Silk and Steel light strings, which are much easier on my fingers and have a nice mellow sound.  I am a novice transitioning from a nylon string guitar so I needed the most gentle strings I could get.  Now this guitar is a joy to play.  Problem is, I get nothing done because I can't put it down!!!And the spruce top is pure eye candy as are the mahogany back and sides. And I like the mother of pearl Yahama inlay on the headstock. Very classy! The quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch.  It just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands.You can spend a lot more on a guitar, but why would you want to when you can get something like this???"
1098,361,3.0,"This is a very nice guitar, the finish and construction is high quality. The hardware is what you would expect from a Yamaha product. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. It did not come with a strap button, sO I had to install my own, but that is true with just about every acoustic guitar."
627,361,4.0,"I love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a Yamaha, I currently have 3 acoustical Yamaha Guitars. The FG 700S is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar. I usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and I can reach the full length of the neck with no problems. It has a deep tone and good volume. I give 5 stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player."
184,361,4.0,"I purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing's still kickin, not planning on replacing it anytime soon.Once I got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel, action was fine for me out of the box.Most definitely one of the best &#34;bang-for-your-buck&#34; acoustic guitars."
903,335,3.0,Now I can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines.  5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales.  A must have for guitar teachers IMHO.
251,335,3.0,See my previous evaluation on a similar product.  It is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be.
970,335,4.0,"I'm an amateur musician and songwriter and this has been very helpful for songwriting ideas.  I haven't studied music formally, so I can't recall what a C#7 looks like versus a F#7 so when I discover a chord shape it's easier for me to diagram it than to look it up on the web.  This helps."
1117,335,3.0,No moving parts. No high tech components. The ultimate in low tech. It's a rubber stamp and it works for the intended purpose. I find this size useful but I guess it depends on the individual's needs. Enough said.
934,335,4.0,"I BOUGHT BOTH THIS STAMP FOR GUITAR AND ALSO ONE FROM THE SAME COMPANY FOR MANDOLIN, UKULELE, BANJO.  I'M PLEASED WITH BOTH STAMPS. LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE, USEFUL TO STAMP CHORDS ON MY OWN MUSIC SHEETS AND OTHER MUSIC THAT DOS NOT HAVE GUITAR CHORDS SHOWN."
336,274,4.0,"Works just as I need it to.  Adjusts easily, nice width, comfy enough for me...(I ordered one and had a problem with the pins lining up and had to exchange it for another one.  Sam Ash was very courteous in fixing the problem. )"
1006,274,4.0,This is my third bench and seems to be the best of them. Quick to set up / tear down / adjust. The bench is also larger than my others. Very happy for the price. 4 different height adjustments.
1077,274,4.0,Wow A bench that really holds my ass.  what can I say about it You really need it with the keyboard stand. and it was necessary to the group.
1291,274,4.0,"Very comfortable bench. It's wider than most, which makes is more comfortable to use. It feels heavy duty, and stays still during use."
56,274,4.0,"This is a very stable, comfortable seat.  The legs are easily removable for storage. Love that it is rated for higher weights so I don't have to worry about it collapsing."
450,274,4.0,"This bench is great for the keyboards and when I just want to sit and play by bass guitar.  Regarding it being too short, you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height, to sitting. If it is too short, then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description.  I also had no problem with a 'bait n switch' issue."
424,274,4.0,"I've tried many types of chairs, sitting on my computer char, etc. but it was always awkward. This bench, with its thick padding and wide width allows me to practice playing the guitar and move around freely. Honestly, I even sat on the floor for a while, but no matter what I did my legs would hurt. I just wasn't at the right height. This bench is adjustable and I was able to find a height so that I could practice for hours without putting a strain on my legs and back. It was absolutely worth the small investment for me."
379,274,4.0,"I'm in a situation where I have to sit to play due to hip problems, and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat.  For me, a stool is too high, and a folding chair too low, plus I need something that folds in with my other equipment.On it's tallest setting, this gives me the exact height I need. I'm 6', so it might not be high enough for a very tall person.It is also sturdy, I'm very animated when I play, and the support feels solid after several gigs of 2 to 3 hours. The cushioning is nice and thick as well."
163,274,3.0,"I've been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011. It's great in all ways but one: The rubber feet constantly fall off. If you use this bench regularly, the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feet.Solution: UseGorilla Glue Epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench. This is what I have done and now I have no problem with wandering feet. On Stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble."
1125,275,3.0,Works as advertised for my purpose. It is in front of a computer speaker set (with woofer) for use on a Vizio TV as a sound system.Works fine. I have other Behringer gear and it always works.
546,275,1.0,I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input. The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier. With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp. They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. I am returning it.
991,275,3.0,"This is a well assembled and packaged unit, designed to a price. So certain compromises have been necessary.Compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the AC out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit, with inexpensive parts. The preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges, and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.On the other hand it works well, is packaged nicely, and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy, but want a basic phono/RIAA amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs. Also, by avoiding the &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; tendency of units that include inexpensive D/A converters and such for USB output, this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.The unit is also very &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; if you'd like to upgrade things like capacitors, resistors, or the opamps. Or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing I'd upgrade. Lastly, if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge, and the capacitance of your phono cables, you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.Recommended if your budget is limited."
216,275,4.0,"Behringer has done it again. The PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp is exactly what it looks like:It's ultra-compact. It takes up a very negligible amount of space. It will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component.In its compactness, though, it does NOT sacrifice usability. It has no trouble amplifying a turntable's signal to line level. Before buying a preamp, amp could only boost my turntable to a 'easy listening' level. The noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary. With the help of this preamp, my amp no longer acts as a crutch and I can comfortably listen to music without my amp's 'I'm turned up to 11 and struggling' noise.The build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point. It's not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell, the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal. This makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look. It also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference.Unfortunately, there is no option to buy it in black. Judging from the accessible screws on the side, though, it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if I wanted.This preamp also does not have a power switch, but this is not much of an issue. It's one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product.Summary:If you need a preamp, buy this one. It has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps."
63,275,2.0,I wanted to wait till I got another phono preamp before I wrote this review. I did get this from AmazonTC 754 BLACK Phono Preamplifier SwitchableI really needed more aux inputs for cd etc. But right away I noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright. The next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others. I am using a vintage Garrard turntable. The rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp. They are tight but do not make good contact and I need to mess with them. This problem is gone with the new preamp. Overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues. If you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where. It does sound ok other than being a little bright. It does do what is supposed to do.
362,275,4.0,I have been using this Pre-amp for a year and it has been great.  After I figured out that you have to attach a ground cable to the record player it installed very easily just plug it in and it plays!  I have not noticed any excess heat or other problems even though I keep it inside of my closed entertainment stand.
1195,819,4.0,"I bought this to replace a Behringer UCA202. The Behringer performs very well for my use (guitar in a home studio), but recently it's become way too sensitive to interference; I was getting noise from the nearby cable modem / router / network drives. This noise was making its way to my recordings too :-(For what ended up being less than twice the price of the Behringer I decided to try this unit. Not only is it interference-free, it has a much warmer, intimate sound.It's USB powered, installs automatically in about a minute under Win7 with no issues. I did go to the Lexicon website and get their driver, though, just to be on the safe side.REAPER had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel (ASIO! :-) ). Everything just works great, first time. I was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero-latency monitoring on the device :-)Great unit. I love the Behringer, but this thing kicks it in the tail."
751,819,3.0,The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate.  Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it.  The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for.  That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs I've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist.  This should come with a good &#34;how-to-use&#34; course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications.
804,819,4.0,"The Alpha is a great little interface. It accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer. It's powered via the USB. The &#34;mix&#34; knob is a nice feature, allowing you to hear your input more or less prominently within the playback mix without affecting the input to the DAW. I'm using cakewalk's Music Creator 6 Touch so I didn't bother to load the LE software it came with. I like cakewalk's software better anyways (just my preference). Some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording. I haven't had a problem with this. It is extremely silent save any noise I would generate anyway from my rig. All in all I feel this is a great product and definitely worth the money."
1309,819,3.0,This a solid performing unit at this price point.  I've been using this alongside my laptop for as long as I remember and it works the same as the day I bought it.  The two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to use.My only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap.  But this is still a great USB interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than $60.
1234,819,4.0,"I bought this to work with my 9 year old son. This will do many cool things, although I am not ready to turn him loose with it yet. I have had difficulty finding the autherision code for the included software. I have been using Audacity which is a free download. I would pay the price again in a hartbeat."
17,459,3.0,"I bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat. It does that (my dial is set at 10 o'clock). However, I could see a tone purist really bothered by the the mid range coloration from this pedal. In live/practice situations, at high volumes, it doesn't bother me much. In the studio, I won't use this pedal for that reason. It was the right price for me, right now. If you want transparent boost, you gotta pay more.One more thing... a boost pedal really shines when it's running to a tube amp for that extra something. I don't think pushing the input of a digital amp is a good idea for sound's sake. Just a thought."
759,459,4.0,This is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn't it try something else. I find This best used to push the front end of a tube amp. its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups. overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended.
1361,459,4.0,"Ok...I bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was OVERKILL. I mean I had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment. I gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration (distortion and a flanger) and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some ""accent"" to a determinate part of a song.It's a cool pedal but I will recommend it for simple pedal configurations. It will bring the extra juice you need.Cheers"
1148,459,4.0,"I pretty much just leave these on all the time. It gives a good boost and body to my tone, with out being to distorted and dirty, but if you want that type of sound you can get it.Great price too."
6,811,4.0,"Got these as a gift for my 11 year old nephew, he loves them, the only problem is that his friends keep walking off with them."
170,811,3.0,hard to review picks..but these are as advertised...havent used enough to see if images wear well...or just disappear from use...but they are what they are...enjoy
140,811,4.0,"These are fantastic and unique guitar picks.  I love the hologram effect and the cute babes as well.  It's always nice to have a conversation item and these little ones age great to show off to your guy friends.  Love them, and they're good quality picks too so I will use them."
269,811,4.0,"Nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls.  Gave some to my guitar teacher, and thought they were the hoot.  A pick is pick, there's no doubt about that, but a little art work sort gives it a personality."
1112,811,4.0,great picks
834,381,4.0,"This is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home. It's a great little unit. The only set back is that you can not use Condenser mics with this, without an external phantom power supply, as there is NO phantom power on this unit. You need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power, otherwise this will work fine with regular XLR or Hi-Z microphones."
27,381,3.0,"This little mixer is handy to have around for small headphone mixes and such, but don't expect it to last forever as is typical with Behringer products. At least it's cheap though!  I just wish it had a power switch..."
941,381,3.0,"(This review is legit)I bought this mixer back in august or september, cant really remember, but i had a horrible experience with this unit, but that's my fault, i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything, so i didnt know how to use it.I hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input, and got a horrible, terrible mix, the hiss from the fan ruined it (i nearly had a panic attack), so i took like 9 months to do research, and found out that behringer made the uca202/uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer, to remove the hiss and unwanted noise.So buy this with the uca202/uca222 to clear up your recordings, do not buy a ""rca to 3.5mm cable"" if your using this for a studio setting like me, and if your beginning like me, do not let these wealthy people fool you, you dont need thousand dollar equiptment, the podcaststudio usb (from behringer) would be fine.So all in all, with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer, the quality was good, but the hiss ruined it!!!!! Use a usb audio interface with this from behringer, do it, if you want 5 star audio quality! Their website has asio drivers to assist you, ohhh and go on YouTube and search up ""uca202 studio"", you'll get videos to help.Please, please, please, please do research before you buy anything! Good day everyone! ;D"
19,381,4.0,I have two Behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations.  Small yet clean and versatile.  Great for gigging remote events.  A great value for the money.
971,381,3.0,I used this one time so far w/my fishman stick and it served the purpose just fine. am looking forward to using it in the future
127,381,2.0,"I had read lots of reviews about Behringer, some people had buzz and noises, etc but this is not my case. I'm not a professional and I just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar/pedal, my tascam DR-03, my mobile as sometimes I use the Tascam to record, the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow.This mixer works great, NO noise, NO buzz, NO nothing but working as expected. Great product for entry level and great price for what you get."
947,381,3.0,"I bought this mixer in order to combine my bass guitar with an mp3 player for silent practice at home. Bass into one channel, iPod into another, headphones out.It works!  There are other solutions to this dilemma.  Pocket-sized headphone amps, and so on.  But they're a) more expensive and b) kind of junky and c) come equipped with built-in effects and amp models which I do not want.  YMMV.)So what's the Behringer XENYX 502 like in this use scenario?1. The blue power light is blinding.  First thing I did was put some masking tape on it so that it didn't prevent me from seeing the knobs on the board.2. Speaking of those knobs, they seem a little rickety.  Be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly.  I worry that the knobs won't stand up to that kind of treatment for long.3.  There's no on/off switch, so you'll wind up pulling the power out of the back of the unit when it's not in use.  Strange for this particular usage scenario.Overall, I think this unit is a great value for the money."
773,189,4.0,I use it with a small amp for singing.It is just the right size for my amp and it get more then enough control with it well made fast shipping .And the price it right.
1090,189,4.0,I just got this to run my passive pa. Its inexpensive and easy to use. Very portable and does the job it was designed to do.
19,189,4.0,"You cannot go wrong with this mixer.  VERY clean sound, very versatile.  Very reliable.  I have been using these on the road and in my home studio without any trouble at all.  Very much Recommended!"
970,189,4.0,"For what this does you can't go wrong for the price!  I have a small recording setup and play guitar (and bass) with friends.  This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right.  Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more, but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording.  It does all of those jobs well. There is no hum when the unit is on.  I have two small grips though..and they are minor...the EQ isn't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like.  Maybe I'm going deaf."
159,189,4.0,the Beringer 802 mixer is by far the lowest costing and best performing mixer for the price on the market..  Works fantastic and I am very happy with it..
1249,189,4.0,"This device has so many uses whether it comes to mixing audio for a presentation, a gaming video, or playing musical instruments. There are so many controls and this mixer has just enough inputs/outputs/controls for just about anything that I've been using it for. It seems to be very durable as well. It does seem to get hot after a while, but that hasn't affected it's use at all and so far hasn't damaged the device in any way. Behringer is the way to go!"
423,189,4.0,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs. It was exactly what I needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer. For the price it does a very good job. I don't detect any hum at all and I only get hiss when I crank the volume up too high. I recommend this mixer for your home studio. It works perfectly with my sound card. You do NOT need USB to get this to work.
1078,189,4.0,"This mixer is just what I've been looking for. The 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects. This mixer is a little too much for me (considering that I only record with one XLR track & use the outputs for my UCA202 Interface) but it's good to have these extra inputs just in case I want to stretch my &#34;creativity.&#34; Anyways, this is an amazing mixer for the price! Anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one! Guaranteed amazing'ness!"
1384,189,4.0,"I have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back  this was difficult so for the longest time when I had my studio setup I had a mixing board going into the interface. It is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine. This board is great, no sliders which I had to clean. The board has all the same features that were on my 8 channel DOD board that I used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk. The only thing that I am not keen upon is that there is no on/off switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time. It makes the stuff I do in Logic easy. This is a home use unit  great for the price as well as for its quality."
764,189,4.0,"I was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my Fostex MR-8 recorder and did a little research on the XENYX 802.  Just looking at it with it's inputs, number of controls, I would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks. Imagine my surprise when, after reading the positive reviews, that I discovered this thing was only [...]!  I bought it immediately and, right out of the box, it did exactly everything I was expecting it to - this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the Fostex. I'm quite excited about my future recordings using the 802 - I'm like a kid with a new toy!  Highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost."
209,189,2.0,"Behringer makes quality products - I purchased the excellent C-1 Condenser Microphone, and replaced the 302usb with the Xenyx 802 mixer board.When I researched items for a simple home recording setup, I saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer, and read the item description here on Amazon and the Behringer website for the C-1 mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the Behringer phantom-powered mixer boards.That was incorrect information - this board receives power only via USB and doesn't provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics (48v).When I setup the return of this board to Amazon, I informed of the error, and the appear to have acted very promptly on it, as the item description for the C-1 on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for 48 volts.Although this correction is good, it would be more helpful to customers if Behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power.I've noticed in other venues (i.e. musician and sound forums) Behringer gets a bad rap. I don't think its due to poor quality equipment, I think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale. Neither the Behringer website nor the included documentation with the items I bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts."
1049,189,4.0,"EXACTLY what I needed.  Small, compact, functional, and it works!  No off/on power switch though but small consideration when you think about what it can do.  Connect mics, iPods, MP3 players...and control sound and volume, at your fingertips!"
431,189,3.0,This mixer is perfect for the price that is specified. Although the blue LED power light is near blinding; the overall quality and functionality of this product is fantastic.I would suggest this anyone who is on a budget and would want a good quality mixer.
1104,372,4.0,"I've owned and used this product for some time now and am quite happy with it. I did notice that I had problems with an unpleasant humming introduced one time when using it with powered speakers, but I believe this was more so my fault than that of the unit. I learned that my active speakers did not care for input cables past a certain length. For greater distances, using a wireless transmitter to deliver the mixed sound and its matching wireless receiver connected to the speaker units solved this problem completely. The FX processor works flawlessly just as long as I remember to push down the selector to engage the desired function. Very easy to use. Compact in size. No ability to instantly mute an input device other than to turn down the gain. For the price ... what can you expect?!Soon I will be in the market for an upgrade ... one that has slider controls and the ability to connect to my laptop via usb. I need a few more xlr inputs and at least a 7 band equalizer and compressor/limiter for larger gigs and a fairly large choral group and its accompanying instruments. Just waiting for a good deal."
812,372,3.0,This was much smaller than I thought it would be but I kinda like that because it takes up no space. It does exactly what is expected of it. The effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work - although certainly would not replace the likes of TC Electronics or Lexicon. Relatively transparent and controls are responsive. For the money......good value.
1273,372,4.0,"Running 4 mics, samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting.  This mixer handles it all perfectly.  I'm literally knew nothing about it when it arrived (first time I'd ever seen a mixer of any kind) in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly, get hiss free, nicely panned, beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful, professional and frankly better than I could have imagined.  I didn't need the 'FX' .. but the the other was out of stock :D I'll get to them one day.I wish it had a power button."
868,372,4.0,"The mixer arrived early, which was a life-saver.  I immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre-amps were used for three vocalists and one flute, and the CD input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists.  Everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs.  I am looking forward to using more of the effects."
922,372,4.0,"This is one of the quietest mixers I've ever used. The range of adjustability is excellent. 12 channels fill up quickly, but I've mixed 10 at a time and nearly no noise (at least I don't hear any)."
529,372,3.0,"I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX, which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX (it comes with 100 set effects). I have been doing home recording with Cubase and Logic, using a Presonus Firebox audio interface, with both MIDI, vocals and instruments, and didn't use a mixing board, but eventually decided to try one out given that (a) they are making them at very reasonable prices and (b) I had more inputs and outputs than the Firebox could easily handle.This mixing board didn't look that impressive to me when I first checked it out, but having set it up and used it, it operates very well and cleanly. The fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus. The fact that it does not have an on/off switch is a minus. But basically it works well, the EQ is useful, and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer. Behringer makes a range of models with less/more inputs to suit one's needs, so this is great. Also, having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me, as I can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what I want to record. Another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether -- you have to turn it down to zero. And, there are no faders (except the main); instead it uses knobs for everything. Well, I would have liked some of these things, but then I would have to pay more, and what I really wanted was functionality at a good price, and that is what the Behringer Xenyx has delivered thus far.By the way, I am running the following through the mixer: an AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic, an Alesis QS8.1, guitar via line-in (or mic'd), two KRK RP5 studio monitors, Presonus Firebox. Everything's been working and sounding great thus far.The effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me, since I am running Logic, but if I ever use it live, which I may do, I'd imagine they'd come in handy. The effects are just so-so in terms of sounds: usable, but not that great, in my opinion."
775,372,3.0,"Behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so I was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far, so good.  The mic preamps sound pretty good - clean and relatively quiet. The knobs and slider feel smooth and well made.It also seems to send hotter signal to my JBL EON 510s and that's a good thing.The built-in effects are probably its weakest point.  I've heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit.I also wish that the Control Room knob and outputs were independent of the Main Output slider.  That would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again, it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer.  So all in all, not too shabby for a $110.00 mixer but I probably wouldn't use it for recording."
834,232,4.0,"I bought this to upgrade from a Eurorack 802 that I had. I'm quite please with the Xenyx 1202. Lots of inputs, phantom power, and it produces really great sound! I'm very happy with this little mixer."
564,232,4.0,This mixer has four mic inputs. It has some fun effects. This mixer comes with a 80Hz filter and a 3-band equalizer on the mic channels. It has a FX-send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono. I do not hear any external noise. It has a durable metalic case.  This mixer has great audio.

456,768,3.0,"As LC condenser it's definitely a light weight, but for lesse than a $100 bucks it sounds pretty good...Used on acoustic guitar with less than satisfatory results, but got a great sound out of a violin and a fairly decent voice sound.Looking forward to more tests."
583,768,2.0,"bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488.Ive been using the mxl990. mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective. used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started. had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of. i still recommend the mic though. it is hotter than the 990in its highs, but with good compression, power amp and eq the result is well worth the money."
1099,768,4.0,"This mic is really nice. I have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great. Works great on voice overs, singers, and rappers.That said, it won't outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today, but with a little tweaking, and the right preamp, this mic can sound great.There was one review that mentioned it isn't for female vocalists. I've only used it on one and it sounded great, not as good as the one I used in studio, but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available."
1220,768,3.0,"I am not a studio engineer, nor am I a professional musician.  I record songs in my home as a hobby.  I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what I'm talking about.  Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much?  No.  Are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio?  Eh...probably not.  Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point?  Hells yes.I've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic I own right now.  The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious.  I use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy.  Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (SM57 and 58) this was still the case.  But with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open.Admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective?  You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application.  And to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful.My only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it.  Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works.  I took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since I haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way."
158,768,4.0,"use to record my music, works great on vocals and instrument  together or separate. I like the deep tones and wide range of pick up. it grabs everything so you need to be careful of background, get it if you are even thinking, dont forget phantom power is needed !"
217,768,3.0,"Really a remarkable microphone for around $100.  Very sensitive . . . its for studio, not live performances.  Be sure to set your DAW insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter, as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping.  Has a rich warm tone, like tube mics.  Compares to a Audio Tech 2020, not in the class of say an Audio Tech 4040.  Can't beat it for the price."
1050,768,4.0,"This mic is fantastic! I've been singing, writing, and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive German mics I've used in larger studios over the years. There's a very slight presence peak, but nothing like most of the other Chinese mics. It isn't shrilling or peaky at all. Male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for EQ whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff. This mic is also an excellent candidate for a Michael Joly mod, he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under $200. Michael mods these mics and you'd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous U87 with the German name that starts with an ""N"". I'm using it totally stock and it's been great. Buy it."
1324,768,4.0,"I'm pretty new to using mics and PA systems but have used dynamic mics in the past, recreationally.  This condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic, I was surprised when I took it out of the box.  It is as good looking in person as in the pictures.  Three things for the benefit of other newbs: 1.) I learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you're going to use this for vocals, since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it. 2.) This has a cardioid pickup pattern; you don't sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic.  This should stand straight up on a mic stand, paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it. 3.) It requires phantom power.  You need a PA that provides 48V power to use it.When I first used this mic, I tried singing into the end of it and couldn't hear myself very well.  Later in the evening I was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that I had to back away about a foot from the mic.  Then I remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand, paying attention to the orientation of the mic.  It was so sensitive that I really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals.  I have a Rainsong WS1100 acoustic electric guitar I was playing, and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly.  Other musicians were impressed by it as well.  I payed just under a $100 for it, which I think is a great value for this product."
550,433,4.0,"I love this boost pedal so much!  I owned the MXR Micro Amp for a while, but I found that it colored my tone way too much (too much low end).  The MC401 on the other hand doesn't color your tone at all.  It provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive.  The boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords. If you're in the market for a boost or a buffer, I'd look no further.  This pedal is affordable, sturdy, and sounds absolutely amazing!"
557,433,4.0,"I play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass. I bought this Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR because I have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless I boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand. This stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all. Of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost. This thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on. For my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough. Naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot.The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I also separately ordered the Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.The MC401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put. The stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself. Everything is solid as a rock. I don't see how it could be better. Perfect."
426,433,4.0,This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This CAE boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should. I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations. You will not be dissappointed at all. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
263,433,4.0,I use this boost in the effects loop so it's after the preamp section of the amplifier.  It gives the boost I need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever.  I will always have one of these on my board.  Very well made.
83,433,4.0,"I'm using this pedal like a clean boost for leads, and I'm very happy with it's sound. Uncolored +20db of clean gain..."
1119,433,4.0,A very good pedal that you miss only when its off. Super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables. To my ears it restores the high end and shimmer and brings back life to the note. Best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp.
6,552,4.0,"usually picks are picks, but these are a blast, I play by holding the ""horns"" between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes, I had to order 2 extra bags of these because people keep begging for one."
1251,552,4.0,"These picks play about like a regular triangular pick, the rounded ears may be more practical for some players.  They stand out because everyone loves the idea of them.  I would definitely recommend any serious player own one pack of these, and carry one around because they always get a good laugh."
1116,552,4.0,"I like these picks.  They look great, and work well.  I have no issues at all with them, and they play a little stiff when new, but within minutes feel like an old friend.  Great buy for $3.  Give one to a guitar playing friend and watch eyes open wide with a ""NO WAYYY!"" look on their face!!"
787,552,4.0,Bought as a stocking stuffer for my brother in law. Gave it to him with an actual replica of the pick. He loved them. Still has some.
888,385,4.0,Have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time.  Attaches to my audio interface.  No cable switching.  Didn't need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much.  Fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording.
454,385,3.0,"I have a bunch of instruments (synths, back up recordings, ...) plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording/practice.. Having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere. It works fine. It is lightweight and feels sturdy.Only drawback: I tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass, and the preamps saturated in low frequencies. Input has to be kept within a small range."
432,385,3.0,this is what i'm talking about: cheap but very usual form behringer. very handy too. but i hope then would run on batteries next time.
1181,385,4.0,"I have a pretty weird pedalboard set-up involving an EHX digital Memory Man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain.  This does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before I go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp.  Takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be, and they get very loud at the top end, but I have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around 4.5/10.  I tested to see if I could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none."
167,385,4.0,"I use this with my small mobile DJ setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer. Simple to use, works great, no hum or buzz at all."
415,385,4.0,"These are amazing little inexpensive mixers. If you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done.We have two of these in our vocal effects rack summing our effects from six feeds (three per mixer) down to two outputs (one per mixer), the mixers feed direct boxes which go back to the front of house console, this lets us have the effects on stage so the performers can control them and send the signal back to the console for adding into the main mix. We have no noise problems at all with these mixers and they really solved a problem for me, I needed tiny flexible mixers I could preset and fit inside the rack out of the way, not only were these extremely inexpensive they work great.Good luck and good music to all"
633,385,4.0,"This liitle box works great for my needs. I am using three guitars on stage (When possible/room permitting.)and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp. This way I can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such. It also solves a second problem: since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs (Fender single coils, Ibanez acoustic with Fishman piezo and Les Paul Gibson Humbuckers), I now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match. This is perfect for that. Inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that I velcro to my small pedal board..I'm glad someone else mentioned the A/C plug on theirs being European standard and not 110 volt US standard. Don't be surprised if it happens to you. I bought one and had the same experience. I got mine from Musicians Friend. They offered to have me return it but I chose to keep it since I had a 12 volt power supply available from an older unit I long since stopped using. No stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn't check their inventory to make sure it was US standard."
13,377,3.0,light construction but  you get what you pay for.  so far it has functioned well and I do use it a lot.  it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you.  I mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments.  I have not noticed any sound degradation from using it.  the volume knobs are handy for sure!!
867,377,4.0,What a great little gizmo. I play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me. No more unplugging/plugging in-between songs. Just a push on the pedal and I'm switching noiselessly between guitars. I can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well.
88,377,2.0,"Hey it does its job for a cheap price.  I use it put mh guitar and Harp Mic through the same rig.  It does that.  It is plastic and Im not sure its inputs are the most efficient setup, but again it works.  Which in the end is my concern."
549,377,2.0,"This selector is very basic but does the job, if you need an A/B box for simple set ups give this one a try, it works for me and I dont see anything wrong with it, is simple, affordable and functional, what else can you ask for?"
572,377,2.0,"Not expensive. Not cheap. Not exactly what I wanted.Like most all of the Behringer items it has good points and ""duh"" points.If you use it as an  A/B one input to 2 outs, then you can use the 2 volume controls.  I did not need it for that.If you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out, you only control the sum out, not the individual inputs (thought you could, which is why I bought it. the 1/2 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can, but you can not.... I almost sent them back.. I bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that I was switching).the LED indicators when using it as a 2 in - 1 out  (like 2 guitars into one amp, or in my case a mando and a midi-guitar rig into a single line in ) ...  are ...exactly backwards...  the one on the right (red) is actually the input on the left and the one on the left ( green) is the input on the right.... which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant.Operation wise, no hums, no buzzes but no one left on bass.When it is all said and done, I am glad I kept them.Amazon rocks. got them in 3 days. free shipping.  where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar, get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys.  who said Santa was a scrouge.  i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket."
1082,377,4.0,"Any time a person buys an A/B box their only real expectation is to have it switch quietly, this unit is as quiet as them come.  For the price it can't really be beat."
191,145,1.0,"I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this."
789,145,4.0,Perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets. Clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price.
239,145,4.0,Solid as a rock and definitely delivers on its promise. Whoever said Behringer gear sucked has no clue about audio gear. Our radio station owns several pieces along with this unit and are expanding our gear with more purchases of Behringer gear. Super value!
642,145,3.0,"Needed a boost with my headphones while playing Rocksmith.  Item works as advertised, very easy to hook up.  I am using with xbox 360 and auvio wireless headphones (33-283, out of production, but still work great)"
1195,145,4.0,"I hooked this up to the output of my Mackie mixing desk. I have my powered monitors (via a Y cable) on one output and my headphones on another.I can now play my guitar, write, record, etc through the speakers or the headphones and very quickly switch between them without messing about with cables and whatnot.Because my headphones are closed (DJ type) they cut out a lot of background noise and I previously found myself wondering ""are the speakers off?"". It was particularly awkward in that the power switches for my speakers is on the back. Not handy!Now I've installed this headphone amp it's definitely become an integral part of my setup, and definitely worth the money. Now I can actually get on with the music :-)Another excellent Behringer purchase. Recommended without hesitation."
1267,145,4.0,"I use this in my recording studio to allow musicians their own level of monitoring in their headphones for recording and playback. So far I've had this item for about a week, and it has worked flawlessly, and given the exact results I needed. Musicians love being able to control their own headphones, rather than having the engineer in the control room raise and lower their levels."
401,145,3.0,"Do not let the size fool you. This is a very handy piece of equipment and it's so easy to set up and use. Just plug a 1/4 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the HA400, then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs. This is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it's built like a tank. Be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system, you can only adjust volume from the HA400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 1/4 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals."
411,145,4.0,"Behringer doesn't have the best of reputations, but some of their gear does a great job at the price. This is one of them. This gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones. I run a project studio with an Apogee Duet as my interface. I needed this because sometimes I need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording/monitoring a track.My main headphones are Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, Sennheiser HD 555, Sony MDR-V6, and then I have some others. All of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and I get very good volume, and even at the exact same volume as the input, I find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp. It's hard to describe, but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger. I've had a Presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little Behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better.The volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that I can hear that is introduced by this amp. Make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in. For instance, if I run a cable from my iMac's built-in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume, I can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds, but that's not the amp, it's the source. Running the output from my Apogee Duet, the sound is very clean and strong.There are some annoying things about this amp. Obviously the external power supply is annoying, there's no on-off switch, and it's light enough that when everything is plugged in, it doesn't want to stay in place. However, that's nothing that Velcro tape on the desk can't fix, and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones."
676,145,4.0,I've had one of these I've used for years and it has served me well.I needed another so that I could get more headphone mixes out of my soundcard for recording multi-person bands in my home studio.Simple to set up: you get an input for your source and 4 outputs for 4 people to listen to the source and each one gets to control their own volume.[...]
1165,145,4.0,I use this at home on my project studio it works great for headphone sessions. I use it all the time to run an extra set of headphone in to my vocal booth/closet. It's all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn. For the money you can't beat it. Its not professional quality but Ive done some professional quality work with it with no problem.
432,145,4.0,"This product works the way it should be. No frills, no BS. Great price at Amazon as usual."
452,145,4.0,"When I first got this it blew up my headphones and didnt work right at all with my desktop speakers or anything.  I am now glad to say that after getting a replacement headphones and desktop speakers that this thing works fantastic.  It is a small design amplifier and does it's job very well.  I now have my good headphones, my noise canceling headphones, and my desktop speakers hooked up to it and they all work fantastic.  No more unplugging and plugging in the desktop speakers and headphones from the back of the computer which was such a hassle everytime.  Now all I gotta do is turn the control knobs and wallah.  I have to say it works very well for the price.  The only thing I don't recommend doing is turning the volume past the 2nd notch for your good headphones because they might damage them like they did mine.  Anyways, I would recommend this if you hate unplugging and plugging stuff in all the time and you want some more bass."
167,145,4.0,"Purchased two of these, one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other amps/speakers. Works in both environments very well, individual channel volume control is perfect. No hum/hiss from these units at all."
610,145,4.0,"Not sure why Behringer gets a bad rep - this is compact, works as advertised, is affordable and an all around handy thing for the musician.Well built, solid construction - zero complaints."
438,145,4.0,"I have been using this little amp very heavily for about a year now and highly recommend it.  The device is extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next to my mixer, it does exactly what I expect & the sound is clean.  Works great - great price - meets my requirements perfectly."
478,145,4.0,this box is very well made and will last a long time. the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy. i like the fact you can daisy chane this device with more of the same. i am very happy with this purchase and i will be buying a few more now that i know they are made with quality and functions perfectly. i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem.
844,145,4.0,I use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out.  Individual volumes controls make it perfect.
780,145,4.0,"I've owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw.  The pots all still work without adding noise, and in general the device does exactly what I need it to do.  You won't find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp/mixer."
66,145,2.0,My title says it all.  I didn't like the AC adaptor.  I did work very well and was strong.  I liked how solid it was.
226,79,4.0,I had always wanted a phase shifter but I never wanted to pay alot of money for one because its not something I had to have but I just wanted one. The reason I bought this one was because it was cheap. I got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool. You can get some insane sounds out of it. I mean some are so insane I asked myself what could someone possibly use this with in a song. But it's great. It does what it is suppose to do and it is a sturdy stomp box. Couldn't ask for more.
969,79,3.0,"Great sound, works just like a phaser should. I have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds. I use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect. Cool pedal, solid construction. Only thing is that it is big!! One other thing, it works better if you put it in front. I found that in the effects loop, it does not work so great."
536,79,4.0,"Great pedal- very lush and usable tones. Think ""Lightning Crashes"" by the band ""Live"". Ok, I was going to initially give it 4 stars because of the following reasons:  plastic knobs, foot switch does not 'click', very miniscule volume drop with engagement (actually, I moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and I *think* that resolved the volume issue, but I can't tell-  I guess if it is too close to tell, then it's a non issue !). Then I performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again.  Metal enclosure.  Works like a charm.  Twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping.  It gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price."
485,79,4.0,Works great.  For the money you can't go wrong with this effect.  I'm using it more then I thought I would when I first bought it.  The only thing I don't really care for is the stomp switch which is activated with more on a touch then a click.  Seems like it may be a weak point of the pedal but so far it's held up fine.
1148,79,4.0,Perfect pedal. Easy to setup easy to use. It sounds great. Durable and strong. Not noisy at all really clean pedal for your board.
1345,79,4.0,"I'd bought this thing several years ago-forget where-as an alternative to the Electro-Harmonics Stone Phaser. The EH Stone is great, but a) couldn't afford it 2)the adapter input is proprietary, differnt than was on my Boss pedal board3)wasn't gigging out. So I figured, ""What the heck?"".I've had fun with it. With a wah and a proper guitar sound, one can easily emulate the Hendrixish-Univibe sound. Remeber, guitar, touch, pickups, signal, etc all play into that factor. Also its a 'Vintage Style', not a mid 80's mosquito tone killing device. Not a huge range here. No swooshing jet sounds. Just good 'ol wobble.I'll agree with the other guy here and say the durability is questionable, and the size of the thing is annoying by comparison to the standard pedal housing. And, it does make some noise in my chain. Lately have been trying different cables, adapters, and batteries.A tinkerer/hobbyist/modder may enjoy getting a sturdy pedal housing box and putting this things guts into it, and, getting a sturdy switch. Paint it all weird and call it a 'boutique pedal'."
111,872,2.0,"This device works.  Here's what it does.  You plug an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal's high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp.  You also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack out.  You can use just the high-impedance output or just the XLR output or you can use them both simultaneously.  When the ""footswitch"" is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box.  When the ""footswitch"" is on an LED light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on.  I put ""footswitch"" in quotes because I use fingers to push it, but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose.  When you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on, so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it.Some other functional comments about it.  It runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply. I used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter.  Battery life isn't super but satisfactory.  Still if using it a lot, I suggest using an AC adapter.  When the battery starts going it sounds awful, but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set.  Also when the ""footswitch"" is off and the LED is not lit, this thing functions as a straight XLR ouput direct box for anything you plug into it.  You could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist!  The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for anything except bass.The controls are all rotary knobs except the Ground-Lift switch which is a slide switch. The controls left to right, top row to second row are:  DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEL, PRESENCE, GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLEND.Taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed.  The DRIVE knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of overdriven tube tone.  Basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose.  There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want.  The TREBLE knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones.  The BASS knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies.  12 o'clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass knobs. The LEVEL knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration.  The PRESENCE knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone.  The Presence knob isn't a midrange control, but does boost the upper mids.  The GROUND LIFT switch only effects the XLR output jack and it should be left ""OFF"" unless you hook it up and there is hum.  Then you can turn the Ground Lift ""ON"" and it might help eliminate the hum issue.  However it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum.  The BLEND knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal's output with all the way to the left being none, 12 o'clock being 50% and all the way clockwise being 100%.CONS:  Very little bass gear, or anything else, is ""PERFECT"" these days.  Behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using Chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down.  Designed in Germany but built in China means you get Chinese components and Chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing.  For example at the first battery change the battery clip self-destructed as part of the clip's terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip.  This was a Duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries.  Went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint.  I've never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard.  Construction is all plastic. The casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes I know not to use my size 13-D foot on it.  The Treble and Presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed.  Basically I set the Treble and Presence to the point where I hear hiss start, then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit.  Hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off.  The jacks, other than the XLR, are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal, These type jacks are noted for causing problems, especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time.  This unit lacks any dedicated MIDRANGE knob but the Presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously.  Some people who use this pedal as a stage-tool use it as a solo or ""scoop"" switch for slap & tap solos so the presence, bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway.PROS:  First and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features, but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely.  This isn't a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver by any means, but works in a similar fashion to one.  I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use at gigs.  The Tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the Behringer cost.  I use the Behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home.  If I didn't have the Tech 21 unit I might take this unit to gigs, but it probably will last way longer the way I keep it setup at home all the time.  I especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal/practice type combos.  Many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious.  Part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don't get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp.  It is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline, say anything over about 18 feet.  For recording the XLR direct out is very useful and the XLR direct out can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amp doesn't have a XLR direct out.How I use this device:  I have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer.  The output from microphone mixer is patched into a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard in an XP computer. I can then record using the computer's recording software, practice solo or I can play along to recorded music using headphones.  With headphones I can play as loud as I want anytime that I want without disturbing anyone.  Most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass, so I recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers.  You can buy better computer speakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp.  Quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable.Having owned this pedal for about 4 years and knowing what I know about it, I would buy it again.  I would strongly recommend it as a home recording/practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong.  For home use it is fine.  You can use it at gigs but I'd be saving up ""gig bones"" to buy something more durable with better performance."
302,872,3.0,"I used this for a while, but now I have the behringer 8ch rack mount and this rarely gets used. Also, every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when I was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp. I still use this for practice at home."
343,872,4.0,"I have an Acoustic B100 MKII 100 watt bass amp with a 15 inch speaker. My bass is an SX jazz bass. I have always loved the tone of my Acoustic amp, until now. After I plugged this little bad boy in, it brought my amp to life! Now, I cannot live without it. This is the Swiss army knife of bass preamps. Every bass player should have one of these. You can dial in tons of different tones and it gives your amp that tube-like sound. For 29 bones, you simply cannot beat it! Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the Behringer 9V power supply, so you don't have to worry about batteries. If you are a bass player, just buy it!!!"
640,872,0.0,"It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. Tried everything I could, but it's gone. I would not recommend this pedal."
161,872,3.0,"What can you say... at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! I was looking for a VERY inexpensive version of the popular Sansamp, and this does it for me.  Decent SVT, flip top or ""fat tube"" tone, and a nice quiet DI.  I go DI to the house, and the output into my old Seymour Duncan amp/Aguilar GS410 cab. Great tone!! I'm using a 9VDC Class II wall wart (found it in my ""spare parts"" closet) vs 9V batteries.  With the wall wart, no DI hum = Great! Does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply. Never use the foot switch; if used at all, I use my finger.  If broken or lost(who would steal it?), I'd buy another in a heart beat!"
100,872,3.0,"Does as described and really enhances your tone. Good breadth of tonal variations available. Only negative, and it's not huge, is that it can get a little noisy when the presence is increased beyond half. I was using a bass with two single coils which makes noise more of a challenge to begin with."
1030,58,4.0,"as another guy said &#34;not better not bad simply different&#34; it's true. i have dunlop classic wah, beautiful and it sounds good, but there are certain feautures, in this one and in the dunlop, that i do not like.dunlop:-has a little bit of more wah range than behringer-i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it-more expensive than the behringer-to my ears kinda affect just a little bit  the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer:-cheaper-does not affect the tone of your guitar at all, very transparent-more features than dunlop-wha sound is not like the dunlop's, it is different but nice, i personally like.so bottom line, im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic.good deal, just get it, i highly recommend it.thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt."
339,58,3.0,"I have a Line 6 Vetta II with a Floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects (for gigs and in my studio) including a wah pedal but sometimes I take my smaller Marshall down below to jam with friends. I just needed something low-priced that would do the job for me in that situation and I ended up with something a lot more when I bought this pedal. I got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now. I really like it and for the price, I don't see how you can beat it. It seems well-made and I think, or I hope, it will hold up well with normal care. I've only ever used my Line 6 Floorboard and before that, an old Crybaby for wah effects before but I'll tell you what I really like about this pedal. It's spring-loaded so it comes back up by itself. It says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it, allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah. I don't even have to think about whether it's on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways I never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage. I also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there's some sort of semi-annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes. It only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up, so I can avoid it if I try. I don't know if it's just mine or is something inherent in this pedal. I'll update this review if I ever figure it out."
953,58,4.0,"I just got it today and haven't spent too much time with it yet. It sounded OK and I like the features on it. I especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal. As soon as you press down it's on. Lots of adjustments so I'll be tweaking for a while to find my sound, but it seems like it's going to be OK. It's a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve. For the money It's a great pedal."
772,58,3.0,very good pedal for the price  I have bought other behringer pedals that work very well will be buying more from them
1418,58,4.0,I've been playing with this a lot since I got it last week. It really is versatile as well as noiseless. I've mostly used it with the default settings.I haven't had the time to tweak it as much as I'd like but I can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it. Really impressed with this wah!
1238,58,3.0,"I bought the Hell babe 10 years ago, it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since, the same one. i have never had a major problem with it, the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal. Its no crybaby and im glad, it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn't no matter how much i tweaked it. I actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more, especially since it has the auto off and spring back. it really makes my solos rip. buy it, you will have a ball. My only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever....."
647,887,2.0,"Its ok.  It does what it says, but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background."
42,887,3.0,It is a good pedal. It is not heavy and the price is good. It is a good choice for a beginner. Thank you.
879,887,4.0,"Now I can use the clean channel on my amp, with this pedal, for my acoustic guitar and that leaves my channel 2 for my other pedals and my electric guitar."
461,887,4.0,"If you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar/keyboard sounds, this think is GREAT. People are trying to hate on this, but it is fine, I was expecting the worst from the reviews, but still wanted it so I got it anyway. You don't need the adapter they push (the behringer brand 9v), best way to work with this is turn all bands ALL THE WAY DOWN, then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like, then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your ""default/normal sound"" to hear the difference. It works nicely, and for the price it was a steal. In the future I may get a more expensive one, this seems fine for now."
422,887,3.0,"don't let the system absorbs you !  this device as others is really  great for the money, check everything by yourself ! this is as good as other devices that cost 3-4 times more."
866,887,0.0,"Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out."
247,887,1.0,"if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band."
549,887,4.0,"This pedal works well in my rig, I have two Boss EQ20's advanced EQ's and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have, this little toy does the trick, and does it very well, I think that people who writes negative reviews don't know how to use it, it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable, highly recommended... or you can go for the overpriced $100+ Boss original unit, at the end is the same, maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing."
1322,887,3.0,"I don't have any real praise or complaints about this.  I does just what it should, and for the price, it's pretty good.  Like most pedals, it can be used with a 9V plug-in transformer, but it's not included.  Yes, it's made of plastic, but you can't expect any more for $25."
647,501,4.0,The most diverse pedal I own.  You can play everything from Pink Floyd to Parkway Drive with just a few tweaks.
616,501,4.0,"Whatever the name, this pedal is from the Ibanez Tube Screamer camp. The packaging description says it uses the JRC4558 chip and MA150 diodes, and yes, Behringer got the sound right. I'd say this competes well against any of the modded TS pedals. What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob. For the TS pedals in this price range, it's the most useful. You can set it high, and it isn't too icepicky, yet the entire range is useful. This is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound.I prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal, or another overdrive. It works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones. It could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones.I bought this pedal to ""semi-retire"" an older Ibanez TS5 soundtank. The switch on that one isn't as good as the Behringer's. The Behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off. I use mainly solid state Fender amps, and several distortion pedals (including a BOSS Metal Zone). I'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt. The only downside is the slight lack of bass. If you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups (esp. 2x12 and 4x12), or a distorted tone with plenty of bass, this shouldn't be a problem."
345,501,4.0,"I had a BOSS Blues Driver pedal that I really liked, that is until I got this Behringer Tube Overdrive. For blues, you (or at least I) want a gritty, dirty sound, one that implies some of the hurt implicit in blues music. I was happy with the Boss, but I decided to try this B. pedal, and I'm glad I did. I compared them side-by-side, and the Tube Overdrive was much grittier, like a small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit. It's perfect for the sound I want, and I can adjust the amount of distortion to my preference. Some like a LOT of that sound, but I prefer just enough to color the sound and shape it to my desires, leaving the rest to my playing and the dynamics of how I attack the strings.I've now retired the Boss pedal. In a careful comparison, the Boss had a cleaner and slightly more clear sound, which is not really an overdrive, but more of a distortion, but a clear distortion, if that makes any sense. It does add sustain, but it can't compare with the B. pedal's effect, which implies a power barely held in check, just exactly what I was after."
536,501,4.0,"The knobs are a little sketchy - they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong- but the sound is just great.  This little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail.  I may buy a second one as a backup.  Behringer hit a home run with this one.  Not just a 'great sounding pedal for the price"", but an honest to goodness great sounding OD pedal.  No true bypass, but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you won't detect any 'tone suck'.  It sounds good enough that I don't mind the lack of true bypass!"
1030,501,4.0,"i got this pedal to use it along with a boss metal zone, it adds more bite to the distortion range. i barely used it by it self but definitely for the price we can not beat it. behringer pedals  and joyo pedals as well are the best in the market for quality and low price. thank u guys!!!"
1151,501,4.0,WOW something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit.
1066,501,4.0,What can I say that you haven't already read about this amazing pedal? If you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal. If your looking to play out with it know that it's cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds. Have a backup. Take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal. That alone can cause problems... As far as tone goes it rates very high on the Tone God List. You can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal. It has out muscled my 2 other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard. I use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and I never turn it off once we start playing. I leave it plugged in on the board all the time. I reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off. I carry a backup pedal... I LOVE THIS PEDAL!...just don't ever drop it...
953,501,4.0,I like the sound of this pedal. It gives my ss Fender Princeton chorus a good tubelike sound. I have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy. I prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs. The TO800 gives me the sound I like without breaking the bank. I haven't used batteries in it because I use a 1 spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard. If you'rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger. You won't be sorry.
463,501,4.0,this is a fun pedal and it really seems to work pretty good as far a getting tube like tones. Simple
975,501,0.0,"Bought this because of all the great reviews, ButThis doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though"
199,501,4.0,I love this pedal. It gives just the right amount of crunch when needed. Typical Behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound. I use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern. Nice and quiet when not in use and can scream when you need it to. Highly recommended.
1205,501,4.0,"For the money, this one's a no-brainer.  It's a one-trick pony, but that's what it's supposed to be, and it does its trick very well.  Sounds better than the Ibanez or Boss models - warmer and less processed-sounding.  Plugged into a solid-state amp, at its lowest drive setting, it sounds like you're playing clean through a tube amp.  Plugged into my '65 Twin Reverb (not a re-issue, but the real thing)- WOW!I just got it a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem. Don't be a 'gear snob' who looks down on lesser-expensive products - the sound is what matters."
832,501,3.0,"Sound just like an Ibanez Tube Screamer to me. Many seem to complain about the plastic housing but, I'm fine with it. Seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so... Sounds great but I also have a Berhinger Ultra Metal that I think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this. Note I use it with a Marshall JMC800 head, a Marshall JMP head and a Crate Blue Voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent. I've got some videos on YT if you search UM300, JMP800 and Blue Voodoo out."
763,501,4.0,"I am not a giging muscian or even a serious player.  I play for fun and relaxation.  I have been playing for about 10 years but only in the past 2 years have I taken up the electric gutiar.  I have a very simple amp setup with a Fender Starcaster 15 G as my practice/ backup amp and a Fender Mustang 1 20watt as my main amp.  I love the Mustang, but have always found the Starcaster kinda weak (well duh it is a simple practice amp).  I have 2 very basic Guitars (a Jay Turser M300 Series and an Epi LP Special II).  I normally only use the Mustang but latly have found myself really appreciating the simple clean sound that the Starcaster can give, But it is a one hit wonder.  I am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome.  I order this pedal on a whim thinking that it might add a little depth the the starcaster and I might be more inclined to use this amp more.  Boy did I hit a home run with that!  The pedal arrived and I spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster.  The depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing. It truely gives it a tube crunch but yet retains the nice clean sound when the levels are backed off.  Flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion MONSTER.  Yea I know I can't imagine what this pedal would do on a &#34;real&#34; amp!  I also found that I'm getting better response with my guitar tone knob too.  THat was always an issue with this small amp- the tone knob made very little difference.  Not anymore.  I can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again.  Yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people.  Just for S and G's I plugged this into the Mustang (set on Brittish 60's Red) and turned the levels way down.  Amazingly it backed the crunch and distortion way off from this setting (so now I can go clean without having to touch the amp!)  All the reviews have stated how nicely this pedal works on the upper settings but it was great to find out that it can be used effectively to clean up a dirty channel!  I look forward to playing with this some more on both amps.No for the nuts and bolts of the thing.  Yup plastic.  Well I'm very gentle on my gear (this sits on a table next to me and is activated with my hand) so I don't expect issues, but if I was a thrash metal rocker I would probably look elsewhere for durability.  Don't drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime.  The switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate.  No issues there.  The dials are easy to read and turn smoothly.  The LED is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker.  I'm using the AC adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement.  THe box is heavy enough to stay in place, but lite enough that I could easily toss it in a gig bag and not worry about it damaging a guitar.  Cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime.  I left the unit plugged in overnight and there was no desernable heat in either the adaptor or the pedal.  after palying for an hour the pedal was still cool to the touch as was the adaptor.My biggest complaint has to do with Amazon itself.  I got this for twenty bucks shipped.  Amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive!!! 10 Days!  Yea it was coming from Vegas to NY but 10 DAYS!!  15 Days later it finally arrived.  15 DAYS!!!!  More than 2 weeks.  Half a Month!! I'm pretty sure UPS SurePost had a guy walk it to NY.  I don't know what the big delay was all about but I was horribly bummed about shipping times.  I ordered a few other items with this (AC adaptor and 5 ft insutment cable to use with this) and they arrived 4 days later.All in all this is a great pedal.  Outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget.  If you have a simple practice amp and want more out of it, then grab one of these pedals and be prepared for amazment that so much sound can come from a little package."
631,337,4.0,"This pedal, used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board ('The Labyrinth'), does what it claims to do and more. It seriously boosts the instrument signal from my Tele at a mere 50% level setting and makes the subsequent MXR Distortion + pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain. I've purchased a host of Behringer guitar pedals during the last year (used, I might add) and am happy with every single one of them. Don't let the cheap price fool ya. I've been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970's - yes, I'm ""old"" -  and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer. I'm just glad that I'm getting most of them for under $50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and Behringer jacks the price of everything. Oh yes, I use a OneSpot 9v multi-adapter to power everything, so I cannot comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries. GOOD STUFF!"
1030,337,4.0,"thank u behringer!  your pedals really kick ass, this one is outstanding, and for the price can not get a better deal, highly recommended."
477,337,4.0,Every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig. THe Behringer Preamplifier/Volume booster pedal is an inexpensive yet quality volume pedal that works great!
1060,337,3.0,"I got this several years ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by it, really was nice with my acoustic to raise some volume on my soundhole pickup before the direct box. I gave it to some one after I used it for a couple of years."
1082,337,4.0,I purchased a budget passive soundhole pickup for a guitar I bring to a local open mic.To get any volume from it the sound guy had to boost the channel very high and the sound was still a bit thin.  I found the Behringer PB100 and after reviewing various posts about it as well as checking out the YouTube demos of the device I purchased it.  I used it for the past four weeks at the open mic and have been impressed with how it boosts the sound without effort.  I can add a bit of bass which makes the guitar finally sound as it should too.  This pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now.
1033,399,3.0,"Was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died. Useless now. I used the ""line"" input (to tap into an aux feed that got recorded) as it came off a live board. For the price I guess I shouldn't complain too much. Behringer often means trading price for longevity as the QC seems to be very hit and miss. So now time to decide; do I resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta?Note: this is a low end, but still ""pro audio,"" piece of a equipment. And while it truley doesn't get super loud, for people who say it barely does anything volume wise I have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment? If so, your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the +4dBu ""line level"" signal that pro gear offers. Subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with. And as a result are getting poor volume plus the added ""bonus"" of increased distorion and/or floor noise when you do try and crank it up.Update: well it works some days and not others it seems- so a I keep it around for now as I am having more good days than bad days with it lately. Can't really see a rhyme of reason to it- connections don't seem loose or intermitant or anything like that- I just either have good volume or it craps out??? It is in one permanent location, used exacty the same way every time- so it's never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear."
139,399,4.0,"This box is small, but packs a great punch! I don't notice any difference in audio or loss in sound. The two dials for MIC and MON levels are nice and stiff, and feel like they will last.This personal monitor station is much smaller than I thought it would be, which is definitely not a bad thing! The connectors feel nice and the whole thing screams quality (especially for only $20).If you find you just aren't getting enough mic in your headphones, grab this ASAP."
1267,399,2.0,"I bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio. The idea was to give the vocalist/instrumentalist personal control over their own levels, without the engineer having to change any settings manually. The item works GREAT for that, as long as you're not using a powered microphone. If you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing, and interference when the monitor, and microphones are plugged in. Plus, the hum/buzz is so loud you can't hear anything from the microphone. The only way I've gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a Direct Box, and then into the board.  I'm told that a Hum eliminator would do the trick, but that's another $40-$100 I really wasn't planning on forking out. I'd rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalist/instrumentalist than pay an extra $100 at the moment. Again, it's very good at what it does, if you don't power the microphone."
280,399,4.0,Love this amp.  My Drummer is stoked to be able to use this product and has really enhance our music.  Affordable and great quality
284,399,4.0,"This gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix & a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the ""more me"" setting. It's simple & easy to use. Works great."
1335,399,4.0,"This is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars. Adjust your volume of the main mix, and adjust your instrument/mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds. Perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for &#34;more me&#34; in their monitor. You can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want."
834,373,3.0,"This is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast, especially if you are using any of the XENYX or other Behringer brand mixers (it also works with other mixers as well).This is a great, inexpensive, way to  get your analog audio into your digital recording software. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux (at least it did for me)."
1051,373,3.0,"I do live shows online, and my older Behringer mixer does not have the built in USB port, so these digitizers do a great job for me.  I constantly get comments about how clean and clear my sound is, and while I largely attribute that to the mixer, this digitizer is just as important a link in the chain.  Very simple to use, audio out of the mixer goes into this digitizer, plug the USB cable into my computer, my streaming software sees it, and people hear me.  I am definitely a Behringer fan."
973,373,4.0,I use this with a Behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music. It was just what I needed to give me clean sound. Running it through the USB not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like I was in a studio. I highly recommend it.
1273,373,4.0,"One of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers.  Well - after starting to use it on Windows 7 x64 I was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings.  I went to the Behringer website, I found the product page, found a tab for drivers, downloaded them and boom .... all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days.  Needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap - drivers are absolutely required if you use Windows 7.  I am using this with a Behringer 1202FX mixer - it is a good combo.  The build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough.  I treat my gear with care - I figure it'll probably last for years and years and years.  I am extremely happy, and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation."
283,373,0.0,"Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. WRONG! I am returning it. It does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac (my Mac finds everything). Bought the Focusrite unit instead. Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. Save your money and time. Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others. Yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. It also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me."
1391,373,3.0,"It's hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does.  It works and it's by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer.I use it with Audacity.  At first, I found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss.  After fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out, I thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product.  The next day, I fooled around with it more and realized I needed to turn the mic input down (in Audacity) and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer.  When I did this, it completely shut out the hiss.  I've been making great recordings since.It's a plug and play tool, but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like I experienced.  However, they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well.For those wondering about latency, obviously there's some.  You'll get latency with any type of recording device.  You just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program.The only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high.  It does not sound like that in the recordings, though.  So, it's OK.  I can deal with itThis is a very good product and can't be beat for the price.  When it comes to quality, you have to set it up correctly.  When you do set it up properly, the quality is fantastic.  It would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it, though."
1078,373,4.0,"I bought aBehringer 802 Premium 8 Input Preampsback in July and I didn't know that I needed this. So now that I have it, I can finally record to my laptop! Great product!"
293,373,4.0,"This unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a USB audio input. I have not used the headphone monitoring section (doubt I ever would) so I cannot comment on that feature, but this unit is so simple to use that I was pleasantly surprised.For anyone in a band out there - I used this device to take a line out from our PA system into an old laptop running (free) Audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording. This even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage."
1320,373,4.0,"This little device is more than worth the money.  I run a Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1280S Powered Mixer into the Behringer 1202 12 channel desktop mixer($80)into the UCA202 into my computer.  The recording is awesome.  My recording playback sounds like its live.I use a lot of Behringer equipment and no, I don't work for Behringer.  I'm on a budget.  That means little money.My friends say, ""Duh, oh, well, Behringer is built cheap and is junk.""  And I say, ""Duh, huh, really?  I've got better sound than you, a lot more equipment to power my show, it has never broken down, and I paid a LOT less than you did.""In fact, I use Behringer XM8500 mics ( 3 pack for $60 ).  I was playing a gig at a small pub.  A friend who swears by Sure mics asked if he could do a song on my break.  I said sure.  When he was done, he said, I LOVE this mic.  The sound is awesome.  Nuff said."
764,373,4.0,"I'm reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer, and I finally did after nearly throwing in the towel.  Turns out I was using my mixer's CD/Tape switch incorrectly, thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback.  I finally went on You Tube and found a Behringer guy that has a video that's less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer.  Just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple I was doing wrong - I was over-thinking it. Once I got it to working correctly, I could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly, including the control on my PC that controlled the recording volume for this unit.  So, now I'm looking forward to doing some real recording with it, using Audacity as my main recording software. (Edit: I did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really, really pleased with the results - I can hardly wait to do some more recording with this. So, to the arrogant salesman who bad-mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a $150.00 Lexicon unit, I won't be needing that - I'm quite happy with this little interface, thank you very much. And to everyone else, don't forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your PC and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on-board sound card.  Thanks Behringer, this is a great value!!"
633,373,4.0,"I own two of these Behringer boxes (they come in two modals) and use them with Sonor/cakewalk and an internal software sound modual (Roland Virtual sound Canvas) to play back midi files with my live two piece band. The sound through the PA (Soundcraft mixer and Mackie active speakers) is loud and very clear, in most cases, no eq needed. I guess it really revolves around your personal needs. For live performance these Behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal. I do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone DAW (Tascam 2488 24 track).If you are a live musician or a DJ using something like Virtual DJ these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards."
460,373,4.0,"This is a solid little USB Interface.  There are no frills, and there's no latency.  I have used this for @ 4 years without any problems, and it's very portable.  I run this between my small, 8 channel mixer and my laptop for recording guitar, and it's well worth the price to have one of these around.  Can also be used with tape players to import audio into your computer; I use this for more than just guitar recording."
277,373,4.0,"Got this based on other reviews, especially one who took the time to really expound on it.  I used it for recording a cassette to computer, but I really bought it to use to interface my mixing board with my computer.  Should work just fine.  The seller was fast, getting it to me over 2 weeks ahead of the projected arrival date.If you've used other Behringer equipment, you may or may not be impressed with their quality.  Just remember, that although they may be engineered in Germany, they are made in China.  Enuf said.  This particular unit seems to be built pretty well, but time will tell."

If you buy EZ Drummer 1.0 from now until then, you will ALSO get the download for 2.0. Bear in mind, EZD2 is a completely new/different program from EZD1, and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 Pop/Rock Kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the EZD2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the ROCK! expansion kit from what I've seen). EZ Drummer 2.0 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available. ***RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMING***If you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find. It's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product. You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother: Superior Drummer 2.0, made by the same company. Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument.There are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately. YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation (Pro Tools, Cubase, etc), and set EZDrummer for multi-track output. From there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal. Most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: Kick Drum, Snare Top and Bottom, Toms, Cymbals, Overhead, and Room. Once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically. Adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY close-to-life. In reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit.As far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre. The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD (after performing the mods above)... but only for Rock. As for me personally, I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, I found the Rock kit lacking, especially since it's a ""tight"" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick)."
685,287,3.0,"A breeze to install on my mac mini, simple to use with Garageband. The bad reviews here are bizarre, written by inept people who either can't handle the install or have a buggy PC or OS. I was up and running 5 minutes after I tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging.There's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software, go do some research, see if you like it. It's way better than the drum kits that come with Garageband and there's plenty of kits to expand with. I got the Vintage Rock kit and I love it - almost as much as I love pizza, which I will marry some day. I like a cheese pizza. Some call it ""plain"" but with the right blend of sauce, cheese and crust, there's nothing plain about it - it's somewhat complex, much like myself. We are a perfect match, pizza and me. We go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom. I'm not exclusively a thin crust guy, sometimes I dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish.The only weak point in this pizza I mean software is that you can't do a cymbal swell. Apparently, it's the same with all these virtual kits, regardless of brand, but it would be nice if someone (toontrack) would address it by including a ""side stick"" attack on the crashes. If you try to do a cymbal swell, you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal ""ting"" with each attack, so it's kind of a ""ting-ting-ting-ting"" sound instead of ""bwooooosssshhhhh."" I'm sure I can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting. Bwoosh loop - no ting-ting. Do I get a fortune cookie with that?Pizza time!Ohhh, myyyy loooove... my darlin'... I hun-ger for.... your crust...."
174,287,4.0,"I could go on and on for days, but the best things about EZD are the endless EZX packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live, organic sound that you can never get with loops.You can edit the grooves and fills via MIDI if you need too, add in cymbals, etc. It's really, really an amazing program. Best money I ever spent!"
1253,140,4.0,I have a solid non weight relief Les Paul Traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me. Like these better then the bulkier Dunlops.
426,140,4.0,"Best straplocks I have ever had! In almost 30 years of guitar playing, I have tried many straplocks: cheap, expensive, nickel, steel, gold... youn name it, I have tried it. These are the best, topping any other by far. More secure than all competitors, never wear out at all, locking system never fails and these always maintain their fantastic looks and for a very long time. I have them in Chrome in every guitar I own. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
1405,140,4.0,This is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar. If you don't enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but don't like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar won't slip out of the strap while you're playing then upgrade to this system!
980,140,4.0,"Besides looking cool they are for sure not going to malfunction, you have to pull up on the tab to get the strap to release. they spin nice. Good locks, I like them better then the dunlops."
788,140,4.0,"For anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once, is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind. I mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used, so I wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily. Anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose. Also, I didn't want to have short &#34; strapletts&#34; dangling from my guitars while it's being displayed. So for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes, I get everything I wanted. Quick release and reattach of the strap, the piece of mind that it's not going to just randomly drop one day, And they come in all the standard finishes, chrome, black, gold, nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display. I have these on all my guitars and always will. As an added bonus, once you have these on multiple guitars, you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear."
1364,41,4.0,"When I first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune. Mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and I later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame. Sometimes I just don't pay attention to the obvious;)It turned out that there are 3 short tuners and 3 long ones. The long ones go on the top 3 strings, the short ones the bottom 3 strings, get that because I had them on incorrectly. And even worse, I was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the 2 bottom strings. The string tree(google guitar string tree and you'll see one) was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners. I know silly but I was not paying attention.The reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune! The string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune. Please take a note of that.Overall a good product."
1030,41,4.0,"i got two sets of these tunners, my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now, i love them."
291,41,4.0,"If you have never used these tuners before , you are in for a treat! New strings have never been easier to install. Great upgrade for Squier Telecasters!"
524,41,4.0,"There isn't much I can add to the good reviews already out there that I read before purchasing these for my 91 American Tele but I will say I really like these tuners and I'm very happy I switched to them. High quality and great design. The guitar just stays in tune now, period. Attractive too with the Fender F on the face of the locking knobs and NOT a big bulky look like I thought they may be before I tried them. Very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar. If your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you'll like them or if you should go with a different brand? Go with it and get a set of these! If your experience is like mine you'll be very satisfied."
722,41,4.0,I put these on a dual humbucker USA Strat.  The neck was pre-drilled so the posts on the tuners and the diameter of the center post fit perfectly.  Job only took about 15 minutes.  Excellent build and looks great.
570,41,3.0,"These really aren't a very good value. If I had to do it over again, I would probably get Wilkinson locking tuners which are much less expensive and a lot easier to install. If money is no object and you need the F trademark on your tuners, then I guess these are for you."
518,41,4.0,"The locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat. They went on easily but, I noticed they are staggeered so make sure the the taller tuners begin at the low E. After the install I stringed it up and played for a couple of hours. Cosmetically they do look cool and functionally which of course is the purpose they keep it in tune. I am not a big trem guy but when I use it I do not ""now"" have to worry about its tuning."
669,41,4.0,"I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat. What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that. But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before. These are easy to install and simple to use. All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set. As others have pointed out, these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way. It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove. I've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I don't even notice the difference. They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected."
1230,41,4.0,"I ordered these tuners for my Fender Blacktop Stratocaster (MIM). I just received these tuning machines today ... the pegs line up, so they drop right in. Remember ... the E-A-D are that tall capstans and the G-B-E are the shorter capstans ... it all works out. I've also put 5 springs in the block (I like stiff tremelo, bridge flush to surface) and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional Strat knobs (had to get CTS split-shaft 500K pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots). The amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar. BUT, back to the tuners ... they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning. Much easier and faster to change strings.I just ordered another set for my Strat H-S-S ... great guitar but could certainly use these tuners."
1211,41,4.0,"This tunners turned my normal cheap Squier, into a perfect Squier. My guitar now stays in tune better than my PRS and Epiphone."
1224,41,4.0,"Super easy to install on guitar, they look great and they make changing strings a breeze. In just a few minutes I had restrung and tuned my guitar with no problems at all. The best replacement for Fender tuners, by far."
861,41,4.0,"I did the swap myself in a couple of minutes, this are the Ping model 18:1 ratio and they stay in tune just perfect!"
1117,41,4.0,Excellent product at a righteous price. Helps my guitar stay in tune.Changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better.
650,41,4.0,"I replaced the original Indiana guitar tuners with the Fender Locking Tuners, and what a difference!!!  I had to drill some holes in my headstock, but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling.  Then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them.  The locking mechanism is great!  It acts like a vice in a woodshop project.  And all I need to do is put on new strings and lock them down, tune them, use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings, retune a couple more times, and they just don't go out of tune anymore, regardless of how many times I bend the strings.  These are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune."
197,41,4.0,"SUMMARYIf you aren't using locking tuners, you're wasting time when you restring. They are just faster and easier. Overall, this is a really nice convenience upgrade on guitars and it's not very expensive to do. Fender uses these on the American Deluxe, and once I got one, I had to have these on the rest of my stratocasters. Because they save time restringing, you are more inclined to restring frequently, which means you sound better. (Fresh strings can do a lot for your sound!)I've put these on several guitars I have, and always appreciate them when changing strings. At instalation be aware these are staggered height tuners so be sure to put them in the correct holes (see below). These are drop in replacement tuners for most modern MIA and MIM Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters that use a Shaller style tuner. Fender makes these relatively cheap now in chrome, although I wish they would make them affordable and available in a gold finish. I've seen also seen nickel and black, and they make gold but hard to find and rather expensive (something like $120 a set).FUNCTION/PURPOSEI think people believe these somehow give you more stable tuning or something but that is actually not their purpose. Proper use of a traditional non-locking tuner is just as stable. Some folks don't actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they don't get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and don't string it correctly. For those folks, these will elimiate the resulting ""pings"" and such. But their intended purpose is to speed string changes. I believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect. A locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning, and that's why you always find them with Floyd Rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing. But locking tuners are not really for that purpose.FIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside. If you are considering a replacement, make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you don't have to drill the back of the neck, the tuner bores in the headstock, or use inserts. If you want to use these but don't have the little alignment holes, Stewart Macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes. It's expensive (about $40) but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts. It is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig, and even with the jig, easy to be slightly off. These fit most newer FENDER stratocasters and tele's, both american and MIM and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those cases.Pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change. If you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount. Maybe buy and inspect, with the knowledge you might have to return them. There is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isn't it, look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now. Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole.Typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at [...]These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- For Fender/Shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64"" and the rest at 11/32"".- Vintage style tuners use 11/32""- Gotoh and Grover use a two step 13/32"" to 11/32""- Sperzel uses 25/64""- Planet waves uses 13/32""Of course, if you are mechnically inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar. Sometimes that means using inserts or bushings, or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw, or for alignment pins in different locations...but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a drop-in replacement.When installing, be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners. These are not all the same length -- they have staggered heights - 3 long and 3 shorter. (I think I have also seen some sets that are 4/2 but these are 3/3.) Put the long ones in the E-A-D string holes, and the shorter ones in the G-B-HighE holes."
136,41,4.0,These replaced the stock tuners on my Squier Deluxe Stratocaster and were NOT a drop in fit. There are two pegs on the tuners that didn't line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes. I was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away.These make string changes so easy and I love the ratio of these tuners. Because they are staggered I was able to ditch the string trees as well.
569,41,4.0,"Perfect retrofit for my 1989 American Strat. The locking mechanism is strong. No problems at all. I like to stay brand loyal, so I honestly think these tuners will go on the rest of my Fender collection. Tuning is a breeze and is very stable."
783,41,4.0,"I put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less. They fit perfect on my American Standard Stratocaster. They work like a charm. If you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat. This are a no brainier, the price is right, and they look great on your stratocaster."
813,41,4.0,"These Fender locking tuners are top quality.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  You definitely don't want to go with a cheap alternative on something as important as your tuners, and this is a set you can count on."
603,41,4.0,"Nearly all of the reviews I read on these were very positive, and I concur. These are very nice, solid tuners, especially for the price.They do add a little noticable weight to the headstock, but it's not a problem."
252,41,2.0,"Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat.They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them. Worse, the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so, I'm going to have to fill them, first.The quality of the locking tuners looks great!I only wish that they'd show a diagram with the specs written on it so that I could have known that these don't fit my guitar!"
1031,41,4.0,"These Fender Locking Tuners are the best for Stratocaster guitars, mainly if you have a tremolo system, what helps a lot the tuning stability and speeds up the strings change."
321,41,4.0,These replace the OEM tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock. They look fine. When I get the guitar back together I expect that they will work properly. Delivered on time as promised
720,41,3.0,Quality tuners overall. I like the look and feel of these. The only complaint I have is that after &#34;locking&#34; the strings the tuners loosen slightly a short while later. So I have to continually check that they are indeed still locked.All in all though very good for the price.
753,41,4.0,"For the money they are great ,look nice are very easy to install .you will like them on the guitar."
617,41,4.0,"Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy. I know I'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also. Look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing.July 20, 2012:Just installed these Fender locking tuners on my Strat. Didn't have to drill the tuner holes, they were the perfect size. Placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole (with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them) and  very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points. Then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch I made a center punch mark (just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft) on each indent that the tuner made. Set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than 15 minutes."
547,41,4.0,The tuners arrived today. I had them shipped to my business address. It took me longer to get home from work than it took me to remove the stock tuners & replace them with these. Perfect fit & they look great.
1197,41,4.0,"I had trouble with strings going out of tune too often. Installed these Fender locking tuners, and voila !!!!!Amazing difference !!! Re-stringing is much faster now, and tuning is fast (no long loops around the tuning pegs) ,holds up much longer, rarely need to re-tune now, even after lots of bending and vibrato. ( I love the Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9-42 strings and Fender stainless steel 9-42 strings also).My opinion is every Strat benefits from these tuners, they should be standard on both the MIM's and American Strats."
1071,41,4.0,"I have these on several of my guitars and I love them.  Nice and stable, easy to change strings and lock tightly.  Always check the diameter of your peg holes prior to installing. To note these have the two peg placement anchors on them, so if your headstock only has the single hole for the tuning peg, you will have to do some drilling. Really nice upgrade for your standard tuners."
792,41,4.0,"Easy upgrade.  Fit with no problem, direct replacement for the stock tuners.  Make changing strings a whole lot easier.  Glad I did it."
162,715,3.0,"We use these at our church to light up stands for performing music or doing readings during worship.I appreciate the adjustable antennae so that the lights can be directed to specific areas. The light is bright enough to be able to read even if the room is otherwise in darkness. I do wish they had one more LED in the heads, though - with two standard 8-1/2 x 11 pages on the music stand, the outer edges cannot be lit directly (though there is enough bleed over light to see it, it's not as bright as it could be). Just another 20% output would make these 5 stars perfect.Construction-wise, they're slightly fragile - clearly not made for industrial or heavy duty use - but for standard usage, they will hold up just fine and should last for years.We love them - we have 7 or 8 at the church that we use. They're especially wonderful because they're battery operated. With all the cords we already have from microphones, it's wonderful not to have an equal number of extra power cords running a bunch of electric lights. There's an extra environmental cost with using the batteries versus plugging them in, but the handiness, adaptability, and lack of extra cords make it worth it.Definitely recommend these to anyone, and also recommend the manufacturer add another 20% or so lumens."
117,715,2.0,I am a little disappointed. I could use a brighter light. I forgot how dim LED lights are. I am looking to change if I can find something else.
14,715,2.0,They do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand. The switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey.
597,715,3.0,Works great. I use this thing several times per week in rehearsals and it always does the job. My only critique would be in battery life; maybe a different setup (it uses 3 AAA batteries) would provide longer life. Otherwise it's great-
763,715,4.0,My wife got this for me as I tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions.  THis is the neatest little light I have ever seen.  It takes 3 AAA batteries (included- but I did not find them until I was tossing the package out). And has 2 nice LEDs.  The lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music.  The clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand.  Battery life so far has been at least 8 hours (actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also).  I love the ease at which the lights are adjustable.  A real needed item is you play in darker rooms.
473,498,4.0,"Great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless.  Unless you have a mixer, you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this.  Really puts out the sound though, and I guess that's what you get an amp for!  I used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 2-3 to fill the place.  Very nice effects on both channels."
1046,498,4.0,"I am so happy with this amp. I've had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing. On a couple of occasions, I have plugged in my acoustic, my mic, and my buddies mic, and it still handled the load and sounded good. I'm impressed. I even have a Digitech pedal that I use with my Fender Strat, and it sounds amazing. I highly recommend this amp."
476,498,4.0,"This amp sounds great, looks great, works great and is a breath of fresh air from &#34;modelling&#34; amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through. This Behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five &#34;flavor&#34; settings in each. They are all on one dial and there is no pushing, pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you've switched gears. Here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty. There is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar. The foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar, microphone for singing, drum machine. The EQ sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set. I've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned--it's velcroed on there just fine. The cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material. Plenty loud."
310,310,4.0,I have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market.  This metronome has 2 distinct audible sounds and a flashing light which makes it much easier for me to see and hear the beats.  Works very well.
668,310,4.0,"Very nice metronome with just enough features. In particular I love the name based tempos displayed on the face, many metronomes do not have that feature.  Sits on a standard music stand fine without falling off."
1217,310,4.0,My aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it. It's been in heavy use (1+ hours per day) ever since we got it many months ago and I don't think we've even had to replace the batteries yet. It's got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust. We tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn't loud enough and my kids (though very adept at touch screens) found them tricky to adjust. This one is great.
1129,310,4.0,"The tuners I have for my guitar/banjo have modes for use as a metronome.  The problem is to use them as a metronome you have to push a small multifunction button to switch to metronome function, then press smaller buttons to set the speed of the metronome.  I find them annoying.This metronome can be set with one hand by simply turning it on and twisting a dial.  The speed is easy to read and setting the loudness of the metronome clicks is easily changed.  And there are two clicks to choose from.  The metronome has a flashing light too.Overall a very useable metronome.5 stars."
402,310,3.0,"When I sit down to practice my guitar, I just want something very simple to keep time. It was a pain previously to have to mess with menus and such on a computer to bring up a metronome app from tablet, phone or computer. With this, I'll just have to flip a switch and dial the tempo that I want. Simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines. I do recommend this one."
1009,310,3.0,"The only complaint I have about this is that there's no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over. This probably doesn't matter to all of y'all though. Other than that, it's a very nice machine with a flashing light and two &#34;click&#34; options. Easy to use and quality built.  ~Pegleg~"
894,310,3.0,Volume control is nice. Two clicks to choose from- the low click is better than the high one to my ear. I would recommend this product.
1287,403,4.0,"I bought the Mini Tone Master as a practice amp for my Dean EVO electric guitar, and love it -- but there are a few things you should know before a possible purchase:1. When they say ""mini,"" they mean it. It's a tiny little thing about the size of a hardcover book (or smaller), and about as thick (2"" thick or so).2. It also runs off a 9V battery, though if you have a DC9V adapter, there's a plug for it. it also has a 1/4 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well.3. It's LOUD. Even when at low volume its tones will fill a room. This is a major plus for such a tiny, inexpensive amp.Controls on the amp are great; it has a gain/distortion knob that is almost as good as having an overdrive or gain effects pedal hooked up to a full-size amp. It's strong enough to where if you're playing small gigs such as coffeehouses or hole-in-the wall small bars, you won't need to lug along your 10W (or larger) amp with you, though that may depend on the tone your guitar puts out to begin with. Still, this is an awesome deal; I paid about $30 here on Amazon for it, so if you need a practice amp but don't want to spend a ton of cash, snatch up one of these little bad boys. You won't be sorry."
1156,403,3.0,"I expected this to come with a DC adapter. Nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn't be any or I could have ordered one. The product is good, surprisingly loud. The bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles (once the battery popped out by itself when I played a low E) but that's no issue. I have only used it with a 9V battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain. I hope that doesn't happen with an adapter. It's a nice little amp, good for carrying around. If you have long fingers, you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it's height - it's that small! A guitar strap, a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it. The distortion it gives is good. Not good for palm muting. This is nice for practising Randy Rhoads, The Doors -type of rock where not many effects are used.Also remember the DC adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner -. Many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one. It's easy to change the polarity, open the box of the adapter and exchange (needs soldering, obv) the red and the black wire places!"
279,403,4.0,"I like the sound of this amp. As has been said in other reviews if you want clean sound it isn't the loudest in the world, but is loud enough for practice. If you want a little distortion, turn the gain up and you can have plenty of volume. I'm using it with a cheapo guitar from the sixties, (a Decca), and I believe it produces the best sound I have ever gotten out of it."
621,403,4.0,"Sounds ok on its own, not very loud or good quality at any high volume, but then when you plug in some good headphones, AWESOME! Great gain, tone, high volume, sounds awesome, perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect. Great sound, awesome deal. Score! :D"
303,403,4.0,"I have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex - space and noise is an issue. As a beginning guitarist, I contemplated a small amp but decided on the Mini Tone Master (because in my apartment, the smaller the better). Also, I had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that I am... I just wanted something no-frills that was small, compact with enough quality sound to help me as I practice. The Mini Tone Master delivers well.I was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce (from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone). It does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery. Battery life is also pretty good. I've had the same battery in there for several months already, playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far.It is a little frustrating sometimes, as another reviewer mentioned, to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling, I found a setting that was acceptable to my ears.While I didn't need volume, this little guy can be loud! No weakness there.I also plugged an acoustic-electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well."
234,106,4.0,"So, these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar, but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice.  Nonetheless, I put a couple in just to compare them to my old, plastic pins.  What a difference!  Unquestionably, the sound board was far more sensitive.  Sustain was much better and I got a richer tone, as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported.  I should say, however, what I got was definitely the true, ebony wood pins with the inlay.  I can't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors.  While these won't work due to size, I'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when I find the right size."
841,106,3.0,"Make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing. Most of them are plastic.I bought the ebony with pearly inlay. They look great, it is, indeed, real ebony with a pearl inlay.The pins are sort of an odd size (not sure if there is a generic pin size...), so they might work, and they might not. They fit one of mine perfectly, and another, not very well. I would assume they fit all Martin guitars well, because my experience with Martin is that their instruments are pretty similarly made in way of parts and quality.Overall, great bridge pins for the price, and they sounds much better than plastic ones!"
395,106,4.0,Thanks for the prompt and good service. These are a quality product and really enhance my Guitar and I am very happy with them Thanks !!!
1355,322,4.0,"When you get it, it looks so simple, so basic that you can't believe that it doesn't come with the mic, but companies got to make their money right? I use it with my Samson CL8 condenser and it is perfect. Works great for podcasting, vocals or anything else you want to record. The adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever, it does its job well."
1167,322,4.0,"This is a very nice looking and solid piece of equipment. with a single modification, I was able to fit an array of other condenser microphones in this shockmount. I have never owned a samson microphone but judging by the quality of this product, I would definately consider buying one."
195,322,3.0,"This Sam SP01 can be easily modded for use with the Oktava MK319. I found instructions through a google search. The metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed. Instead of hammering it out, I used two screwdrivers to pry it out. That leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use. Using my dremel tool, I was able to enlarge the hole just a bit. As a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove. You must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible. Then your Oktava will fit just fine. This mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting. I'll post up a picture later.I found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality. It wanted to cross thread as I putting it on my mic stand. So I wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently. That's my only complaint about it."
691,322,4.0,"I ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount. It seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on. It's especially effective when the microphone is on my desk, where my computer tower (which has 7 fans) is directly under it. It's not perfect, but the level of noise reduction really is amazing. On top of all that, it looks nice too. If you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk, you should definitely consider getting this, along with a solid stand and a pop filter."
76,322,4.0,Fits MXL Cube mics perfectly! Sturdy and easyt to setup. Ordered two more.Rare to get items these days that exceed expectation
130,322,1.0,"While the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the KSM32, look elsewhere."
587,322,4.0,"The Samson shock mount does work with the Audio Technica AT2020, yes. Does it work well? If you can securely close the little gap between the AT2020 and the shock mount then, yes. There is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the AT2020. Only other thing is that the colors don't really match up well but I don't really care, its a good shock mount.Ask yourself before you buy though, do I really need one? I don't really use mine since I have carpet on the floors that doesn't like the mic stand shake too much."
27,322,4.0,"I picked this up for a friend who has the AudioTechnica AT2020 USB and Yes this does work with that mic too.  It's solid, helps with mounting, and will be well used."
888,322,4.0,No problems with this. Fits my Behringer 60 dollar condenser mike just fine.  Like it was made from the same company but it's not.  They must have standard fittings on mikes.
418,322,3.0,"Does what it says it will do and it does it very well. The connector is a 3/8in female slot so make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect to that. The mic/boom stand I bought and the on desk stand were both 5/8in male so I had to buy 2 cheap adapters (6$ each). I also am having some issues really ""locking"" in the Audio-Technica condenser mic to the shock mount. So far it stays in, but isn't ""super"" secure (wobbles just a little if it's moved), but maybe I'm just doing it wrong. Aside from that, though, great product."
219,322,4.0,"Excellent Quality and Craftsmanship.I was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do, I figured it would be made out of a ""cheap"" feeling metal. I was wrong. It is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe. It is strong to. It feels like I could really bang it (I won't) and it would not break.I use this with an Audio Technica AT2020 which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base. The mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still. It does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk (or whatever)that will still come through. It looks cool too (and everybody knows that matters). I am very pleased with this purchase."
423,322,4.0,I have this paired with the Behringer C-1 Studio Condenser Microphone.  It matches the mic well color-wise and fit. The C-1 fits the mount perfectly. I recommend this mount highly.http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000CZ0RLK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1358133926&sr;=8-1&keywords;=Behringer+C-1
1233,322,4.0,"This is a good, durable mount. I like the look of it, as well as the light-weight feel. Not much else to be said."
406,322,4.0,"I recently bought an Audio Technica 2020 and was looking for a shockmount for it, I bought the one that Audio Technica makes and I was not satisfied with the quality, so I returned it and came across the Samson SP01. My first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount I have for my Neumann TLM 103. I immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the AT 2020. As soon as it arrived I put my AT 2020 in it and it looked stunning, after I mounted it on my on-desk mic stand I bumped the table a few times to see how it worked. In short it works great, The SP01 isolates the mic extremely well. I also tested the shockmount with my Studio Projects C1 and Rode k2 (both very heavy mics) and it works great. One word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand ( which I find extremely amusing). Like most shockmounts the Samson SP01 has an adapter that is too small for most US mic stands already in the mount ( the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand). THIS IS EASY TO REMOVE!! All you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it!! Once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand."
540,322,4.0,"This is the best shockmount in my opinion (This is the first shock mount I have tried.). I bought it with a desktop mic stand, and used it on my Audio Technica AT2020 and it worked very nicely. It does the perfect job for podcasting, as well as gameplay videos. I would recommend this to anyone."
1406,322,4.0,Does its job. Good solid construction. Support cords seem to be of good quality. Knob tightens well. Comes with thread adapter. Smooth silver satin finish. Affordable price. 'Nuff said. Just buy one already!
374,322,4.0,This is a quality product.Super fast SHIIPING  through Amazon as always.The product is well built easy  to use pretty straightforward.It's perfect for my Samson mic.
420,228,4.0,I use this ALL the time.  It's pretty basic but really good for a beginner.  (Not all chords are in here but the &#34;core&#34; chords are).  Worth the price-
191,228,4.0,"This Guitar Tuner is such a great and useful tool. It teaches chords and got me to play my guitar better in less than one day.Thanks, Austin Garcia"
536,228,1.0,"I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store.  Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right?  The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well.  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate.  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely.  Strike a note once, and it's sharp.  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune.  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better."
369,228,4.0,Very versatile tuner. It automatically tunes to the string so you just pick and tune away! It also shows you chords in case you have forgotten them. There are other things you can do on this tuner and for the price it is a great buy!
461,228,4.0,"loved this thing, I have since lost it, as happens with little doo-hickeys like this, lol. worked good. pretty precise, meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy. sometimes it felt a little off, but robots know best, right?"
26,228,4.0,"I am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar, and it seems to work fine, no complains"
103,228,4.0,"Had a guitar for years,, always tune it but never time to practice, it tells you what note is actually being played when your string is out of tune so you can zero in on the correct one better.."
499,228,4.0,Very compact size and easy to use.Good feature for the price.Shipping is fast.very happy for this product.Best recommended.
153,228,4.0,"It works great, not much I can say beyond that."
1109,328,4.0,"I've been swapping back and forth between Evans and Remo for a while, but after really liking the emad kick head I decided to lean more toward Evans just for consistency in my setup.I consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest 'compatible' drumhead to what I really liked from Remo on the Evans line, and I was led to the G2 series. (from Remo's Emperor series-- both being 2 plies of 7mm free floating film)Honestly, I think I'm going to stick with Evans from now on though!I ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the 'level 360' sizing, and I wanted to give them a try. My fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that I got was new enough to be L360 sized.I got them on, and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy. I use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process, but it went smoothly. Not sure if it was the placebo effect, but I seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well-- deeper but just as resonant as an 808 kick.The coating seems to hold up better on the Evans heads as well-- Remo tends to 'flatten out' within a few hours of play, where the Evans not only lasts longer, but has a more finished feel to them."
546,328,4.0,"Recently I was looking for some heads to put on a set of Starion shells that I modified. My original plan was to use a set of Attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells. That decision was based mostly on price. Not completely though as I have used the Attack heads for resonant heads with very good results. The Attack heads that I bought though are single ply. To me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but I think a two ply head is better for a batter head. I gave the Attacks a shot on both sides but I wasn't completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to go.In the past I have used Remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively. I still very much like the Remo Pinstripe heads but decided to give these Evans heads a try just to try something different. I am very happy I did! These Starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance. The most noticeable difference between these G2's and the Attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider. The Attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated. The G2's seem to resonate everywhere! From very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance. I have some Moon Gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound. By adding, removing, or moving the Moon Gel pads around I can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tune.I should mention that I am still using the single ply Attacks for the resonant side. With the G2's on top and the Attacks on the bottom these shells sound great! Also, on the bass drum I have Attack no ring heads on both sides. I also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing! So, the Attacks have their place but on the batter side I am very impressed with the sound, tuning range, and ease of tuning of these G2's. If you've never tried them, give them a shot, if you have you likely already know what I'm talking about!"
465,328,3.0,I have been using them for about 6 months. I play about twice a week and they have maintained a good sound over the past 6 months. Not too difficult to tune either.
433,328,4.0,I bought these to try them out. I have used remo a little then I used to have some Aquarian heads and wanted to try Evans to see how they are. Amazing. I practically beat the crap out of them and the held up. My next acoustic drumset will have Evans on them.
260,520,4.0,I don't know why more people don't use these: they're amazing. I've used many strings and owned many guitars. These aren't diamonds or gretsch but they're fantastic. I love them on my strats. The last and make playing a breeze. I don't have any tone loss between these and .10's. If I do it's more than made up by the fact that I can play better with lighter strings.
292,520,1.0,"Strings rust very easily, yield fairly poor tone and break often, though they have the same bending ability as .09-.42."
575,520,4.0,"These strings are beyond amazing. Switching to Ernie Ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar, and if you do any blues playing at all, Extra Slinkies are for you. They bend and bend and bend, are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos, and give a great sound whether you're playing gritty or bright. I also play country and punk, and these strings let me get enough twang and beef, respectively, to play those styles as well. The best $5 you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put Ernie Ball strings on your guitar."
457,520,2.0,"Weak sounding, and break very easily. I would not recommend these to anyone other than those who literally have no callus developed."
153,520,4.0,"Great strings, I use Ernie Ball strings on all 7 of my guitars, both acoustic and electric and never had a complaint. I have experimented with others but always come back to them."
671,520,2.0,"I just cant get enough sustain out of the high E.for my taste. Tried them on Epi LP and a PRS. I'm no Eric Clapton, and I dont use 4 amp heads nor do I employ 3 guys to work on my guitars, but thats my impression. Just not enough umph..."
1215,520,4.0,"These are my favorite guitars strings, they last a long time, bend well, hold great sound, and you won't have to tune your guitar every five minutes like some strings."
1154,363,4.0,"For the price, I got a little more than expected. The sound is pretty great. The scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound. Other than that your can change amount of distortion. Its cheap, and maybe it doesn't have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot. But for the price this is one hell of a deal! Quality item.Only complaints are; its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something. But thats expected, and not that big of a deal if you're careful. Now the one issue I really have with this pedal, its cosmetic so its not worth 4-starring this review; but it did get to me. The knobs. They are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures. They are black plastic ones. They look sorta bland and not as cool, but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet. Still a great product though."
226,363,4.0,"To be honest I'm not metal guitarist but I do love metal music and as far as playing goes I love bluesy solos with lots of distortion. I decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix, one of the best names in the business. And for the fact it was cheaper than most. I'm VERY pleased with the pedal and couldn't be happier."
400,363,4.0,"I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them. This one is my favorite, turn on and go. I think it's better than the Sovereign."
273,363,4.0,"Since, as of right now, this is the only review of this product on amazon.com, I'll try to answer any questions you might have about the EHX Pocket Metal Muff Pedal. This pedal is the model of simplicity; a volume control, a distortion control, and a switch that changes the amount (or lack thereof) of mid-scoop. That's doesn't leave much room for tone tweaking, so ""tweakers"" beware! That being said, Electro-Harmonix did a commendable job of pre-setting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amp's eq to get it right where you want it. Playing through my Fender hotrod deville amp, I was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded. The bass was powerful and chunky, great for heavy metal palm-muting riffs; the treble had a good bite but it wasn't harsh; and all three midrange modes sounded great, depending on the application: Want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone? Just leave the mid-switch on the flat setting. Want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good all-round metal tone? Move the switch down to the low mid-scoop mode. Do you want to play Master of Puppets by Metallica? The high mid-scoop mode is calling your name. This pedal offers quite a bit of distortion, but I was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels, my tone remained clear and defined. It didn't turn into a plastic-y, fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals *cough* metal zone *cough* will. I will mention that this pedal isn't the best if you're looking for a more modern metal tone. You won't get a slightly fizzy, ultra-gain (think Slipknot) sound out of this pedal. Rather it offers a very crunchy, defined roar more characteristic of the pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers.In conclusion, I give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well; this version of the metal muff line isn't designed to be highly versatile and ""tweakable"" in and of itself; get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3-band eq and a boost function. This pedal is designed to be a very simple, small box of pure classic metal tone, and that's exactly what it accomplishes."
504,363,4.0,"Within just three seconds of using the Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal, I knew it was a winner. It delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use. Although it doesn't have a tone dial, it doesn't need one. And I say that after trying it through a small tube amp (15w), a small digital amp (40w), a guitar with humbuckers, and a guitar with single-coil pickups. The closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch. As its name suggests, this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be ""scooped."" It has three settings (no scoop to maximal scoop), and all sound great. Fans of sustain will love this box, for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain. The pedal is extremely small, which most would regard as a plus. I bought this after watching a professional-looking YouTube demonstration of it. It more than lived up to my expectations. If I lost this box, I'd immediately order another one. I have zero regrets."
961,425,4.0,For the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck. My daughters love this amp and works perfect. Product is as described.
773,425,4.0,I brought for someone else. But they said they love it. So I am a happy camper I did it right.
632,425,4.0,"I am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings. This tiny amp packs BIG sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard .... and even my bass. The CD input has NO controls but is a very useful feature just the same. Having Behringer mics and a UB802 mixer, I banked on this being a good amp and was NOT disappointed. The 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument. No 15-watt amp will compete with live drums OR outdoor settings.... and do NOT expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you. Every musician should have one of these around. Money well spent!"
140,425,4.0,"This is a nice small amp.  It delivers nice, pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me.  One thing I like about this amp is that it is very simple, not a bunch of complicated settings to worry about.  Another thing, I think it's the nicest looking amp I have and I have about 10 amps now.  It's about the same size as my little Fender Frontman 15 and sits side-by-side with it in my living room.  I use the Fender for electric and the Behringer for the acoustic for practicing.If you're looking for a no frills amp that doesn't cost a lot or take up much room, this is a good one for you.Makes a great little practice amp.  I am totally happy with this one and see no need to add an additional acoustic amp.Mine looks a lot different than the photo, it's more brown and actually looks better."
133,425,4.0,"Hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music. This small, acoustic Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 amplifier gives the musician/singer the needed outside feedback to get things sounding right.No one hears themselves the way they sound to others. This simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music. This is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing, singing song writer. The Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job.As the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars, I thought a lot for years about trying amplification. I probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life. Much to my delight, together with a passive, inexpensive hole-mounted pick-up (the Seymour Duncan SA3SC Woody) , an inexpensive Audio- Technica vocal microphone and this Behringer AT108, I can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even better!At least as importantly, it allows me to hear myself more the way I am heard by others who will not hear me, as I do in part, from the resonations inside my skull.One of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it. The mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom.To hear what those listening hear, you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming TO you, not FROM you. That is where an amplifier comes in handy. It aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hear.When we 'hear' ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback, we are 'hearing' a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads. The people who hear us, only hear us through their ears. The two experiences are not the same.To discover how we really sound to others, we can go about it two ways. First, we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording, or we can put our practice through electronics - either through an external amplifier or through headphones, so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by others.As an acoustic guitar player, I recently invested in a small, specifically acoustic amplifier, the Behringer Ultracoustic AT108, and have found the results to be simply astounding as I can now, for the first time, practice my songs until they sound the way I would like them to sound to others before recording them.For a small amplifier that successfully replicates, electronically, the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier, this Behringer AT108 provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice, along with a three section equalizer, to provide the self-accompanying guitarist with the sound of what s/he really sound like to others. It can, initially, be a rather shocking experience!Technically, this AT108 is at the low end of the famous Behringer line. Although the company is based in Germany, this box is built in China to their specifications. Solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping, it sports:- 15 Watts of Power amp output,- An 8"" dual-cone full-range loudspeaker with 4 Ohm impedance and a powerrating of 20 Watts,- Inputs for an instrument (1/4"" TS mono connector,) a microphone ( BalancedXLR) and for CDs (1/4"" TRS stereo connector,)- A headphone output connector ( 1/4"" TRS stereo connector, and- Three (Low, Mid and High Range) frequency controllers.The unit measures approximately 13 X 14 X 7 inches, weighs just over 11 pounds and is easily portable. It comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plug-in cabling.Finally, to answer a question I had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp, it does NOT make an acoustic guitar sound, in any way, like an electric guitar. The sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic. The natural tones are enhanced, not rendered tinny or 'electrified.'It is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue. The 15 amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configuration.At a current on line retail of somewhere between $75 - $95, an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing, practicing and listening is now open to me. The Behringer AT108 just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments I have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing, singing and recording."
1409,425,3.0,"I have played, listened to, and used audio amps for over 4 decades, and while I haven't owned every name brand amp on the planet, I do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when I see one. This is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar, with an input for a mic (XLR - no phantom power) and a CD player or other audio source. It also has a headphone output (1/4 inch). It has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs.I got this originally for my mother, who used to sing in an Andrews Sisters-type group back in the day. She still loves to sing, and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam. She hasn't had the opportunity to do that yet, but I have tested the amp and put it through its paces. I think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind. The lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback, but considering what I paid for it, I can't complain.Now, this is not a gigging amp, at least not in my opinion (your mileage may vary). It is small, solid state, with an 8 inch speaker, and 15 watts of power (I haven't measured the exact output, so I'm taking Behringer's word on that). I like Behringer, and they can turn out some pretty good gear, within its limits.I like the sound of the amp with my Carvin acoustic guitar with a Fishman preamp. It is an inexpensive practice amp, so I don't expect the same kind of quality I would from a more serious combo amp. The 8 inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good 12 inch, no matter what. The question is, does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work, composition, or just moderate entertainment value? For me, that answer is a clear ""yes.""However, this is an inexpensive practice amp, and if you approach it with that attitude, I think you will find it a nice little amp. Don't plan on using it for your next tour with Manhattan Transfer, Seal, or Celine Dion."
423,425,4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this, but after reading the reviews I thought why not. It is actually a good little practice amp. I'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood. It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house. I was using a mixer that's hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound. That works great, but sometimes I don't want to be tied down to the PC. I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it. I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly. Just be mindful that it isn't a $500 Marshall amp, but it does well in a pinch."
776,425,4.0,"I just can't believe how loud this little baby is. I also have a 180watts Behringer keyboard amp (4 inputs, with lot of FX) but it's a littl heavy to move around.This little amp does everything I need for small gathering. I tried everything as soon as I received it:1) guitar (classic), mandolin, acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampActually, the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp.2) the microphone, although no reverb or echo, is good enough for singing, sounds as the true voice of the singer3) the MP3 input is 1/4"", which I prefer over the little 1/8"", volume must be controlled by the MP3 player itself4) guitar and mic have separate volume control (we really need it).In summary, it's ready to be used right out of the box.It only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy."
800,425,4.0,"I say perfection, because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It is also a great value for what it does.  It offers ample volume for small venues.  I love having two mic inputs and the CD input.  The Behringer AT108, along with my Fender amp, gives me plenty of performance capability."
287,425,4.0,"Received promptly and tested out with acoustic/electric guitar. The sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances. The treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine. The small amp is just what I was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus, I haven't tried it yet since I can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a 1/4 inch RCA plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time."
487,137,4.0,"this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, It's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.Overall, I'm really happy with this pedal."
352,137,2.0,"I bought this pedal years ago, and like most guitarists who buy new gear, I fell victim to CONFIRMATION BIAS regarding the reviews I gave to my musician friends. Upfront, the pedal sounds great. In the store, if you demo this pedal, you'll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer... but over time, you'll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself. Turn any of the knobs past 12, and you'll get some undesirable nasal/hissy/tinny frequencies that require compression, noise gating, and EQ to tame. The &#34;Top Boost&#34; does provide what it advertises, but if the pedal itself is already Dimebagged and you engage the Top Boost... it just sounds weird and unmusical.Electro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but I think they overstepped their bounds with this one. Where is this pedal now in my collection? Sold for cash. After deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a BOSS ME-70 Multi-Effects to simplify my gigging setup, I figured as nice as it is to have an Analog Distortion like the Metal Muff, it would never compete with the Digital Distortion onboard the ME-70... boy was I wrong. After getting the ME-70, I did an A/B test and the ME-70 took home the gold easily. This came at no surprise... considering both BOSS and MXR are respected manufacturers when it comes to Distortion sounds.What would I recommend you purchase? That depends. If you're in a metal band, and you're recording an EP, no pedal in my opinion comes close to fully-cranked tube-amp distortion. However, if your amp doesn't have a good distortion channel or capability, then a more conservative (and affordable) BOSS DS-1 for a more musical metal tone. The reality is, most manufacturers have great distortion pedals, so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone... since no two distortions sound the same. Personally, I recommend the MXR Fullbore Metal... the pedal I wish I had bought instead of the Metal Muff. The Noise Gate and Mid Scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a Top Boost. The Fullbore also has a Mid Frequency shaping knob... which can dramatically shape the overall sound."
869,137,3.0,"Dang that's metal. Were the first words I said when plugging this thing in to the line. With a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome. The only issue was with some manufacturing detail. The input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time. The buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time I used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is. Be sides that its metal, nothing more nothing less. Razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal."
400,137,4.0,"I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them. If you need more control with EQ, This pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket. More versatile than the Sovereign."
273,137,4.0,"This is a pretty awesome pedal, especially if you're going for more of an 80's or 90's metal sound that's more chunky and defined than fizzy. Think earlier Mesa models, like the famous Mark III C+ that was used by Metallica on the Master of Puppets album. Of course no pedal can perfectly replicate that sound, but the Metal Muff does a pretty amazing impression.Some of the best aspects of the Metal Muff include:1. Great clarity and definition, even on higher gain settings. Seriously, most high gain pedals cause you to lose a lot of definition in your playing, but the metal muff doesn't do that. So especially for the lead guitarist, this should be a major selling point.2. Wide range to the tone controls. With some pedals it's really hard to hear a difference when you adjust the tone controls, but not so with the metal muff. You can easily dial in the sound you're after, or maybe even find a new sound you like even better.3. The quality of construction is absolutely superb. Everything about the pedal is rugged and durable. I'd feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup.On a different note, I've only used this pedal with my Fender Hotrod tube amp, and it sounds great. However, I prefer the Rocktron Zombie pedal to the Metal Muff(see my review of the Zombie for more info on that). However, the Rocktron Zombie doesn't sound good through solid state amps. I mention this because if you're using a tube amp, I honestly feel that the Zombie is a better option. But if you're playing through a solid state amp, the I've read that the metal muff still shines. Just something to consider.To conclude, this pedal is awesome if you're looking for a pedal to give an all-round good, straight-up metal sound. Sure, it's a bit of a one-trick pony, but it's a pretty good trick. If you're looking for an ultra high-gain distortion monster then look else where, but otherwise I recommend giving the Metal Muff a look."
1022,477,3.0,"Not much to say about a basic bag.  It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar, has good padding, and has a large front pouch for music and small (fairly flat) items like a tuner, winder or spare strings.  Has a carry handle/strap, but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have.  Seems well made."
168,477,4.0,"Just an all around nice case, good construction, good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver.  This isn't one of those semi walled cases, this is just a normal gig bag.  Works for me, in fact I bought another for my classical."
1299,477,4.0,"Nicely made and well-padded guitar soft-case purchased to protect a Jasmine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar.  The guitar fit inside the case perfectly, and a zippered pocket on the case allows for storage of picks, stings and other flat items.  Very nice product."
1355,6,2.0,"Hey, it's a fun little toy, but I've seen this thing going in most places for an even $100 which is ridiculous. I was lucky enough to get it on Amazon for $80. Once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust.  I've made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it's not one of those tools you'll use every song... unless you're so amazing you can make it work every song! Learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun, but once you get it, and you're over it, you wonder why you wasted $100 on something that shouldn't have cost more than $50. It's essentially a 9V battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light. This was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when I had nothing better to use my money on."
565,6,3.0,"I first became aware of the EBow way back in the 80's when the song &#34;Big Country&#34; by the band Big Country came out. They used it to simulate bagpipes and I always loved that sound. I finally purchased an EBow about a year  ago. I'm a songwriter and record my own demos at home. I also perform live in a cover band. I don't use the EBow very often but when I do, it really adds to the performance. I recorded an EBow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional. For live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating. With practice, I think this could improve. I play the solo on STP's &#34;Sour Girl&#34; and it sounds very much like the original recording. People in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and I get questions about how it works. I have not had good luck with arpeggios but again, practice could improve this.The octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound. Battery life is exceptional. I have only had to replace the battery once. Overall, I think this is a great product. I wish it had been a bit less expensive but if I lost it, I'd buy another one."
237,6,4.0,"The ebow is a crazy concept. It's fun to use and also very challenging. It comes with a book that had many variations on how to use it, which was nice. Comes with a velvet pouch and dvd. It's a little pricey now I assume from supply and demand but if you've got the extra cash and play every day, pick this up. Also, I played in a band and we did Miserlou and the other guitar player played the trumpet part with an ebow. I don't know how he did it or what setting his amp was on, but it sound like there was a TRUMPET in the room. He clearly, was good with an ebow. Goes to show how diverse they are."
1283,6,2.0,"I wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately, it just isn't my thing. I played it all but 2 weeks until I got bored and stopped. It now sits on my amp collecting dust. I pick it up occasionally, but I always end up putting it back down shortly after. I am sorry, I just can't dig it... :(Edit: So apparently, a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post. Normally, I'd just laugh at these no-lifers, but I am sick of getting constant e-mails from internet tough guys, so I'd like to formally state  that this is not a bad product. It can be fun, but the effects it gives are not worth $100, and its build quality is not worth $100. Like I said in the original post, I became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed. The last time I picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout  active pickups on my schecter. Its not that I ""didn't know how to use it"" like one of the morons in the comments section stated, this product requires very little skill to use. Read the manual if you are having trouble, it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this device.Would I recommend it? If you have a hundred bucks to drop, go for it. If not, your money is best spent elsewhere."
802,6,4.0,The e-bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar. Great tool!
665,557,3.0,"These Nandy mics are great entry level mics if you are looking not spend to much cash.  They have a long range and great sound fidelity.  If you are trying to save on your budget these are great, if money is not an option keep on looking."
1346,557,3.0,works ok for the price and features it is fine. get the batteries it did not came with any. I am using it for a dj karaoke system I do recommend it.
1398,557,4.0,got the mics from dealer fast .i pluged them in and they are great no feedback and great sound .they sound better than my sure mics looking forward to useing them at my next showi would tell a friend if they want set of good mics at a great price these would be the ones
18,557,3.0,"This microphone works well for our needs. I purchased refurbished so, when I received the microphone, the mic piece is actually removed from the handle. It could be from shipping. I re-attached the item and added a windscreen. Now, my kids play around with it and the microphone never detached anymore."
1127,557,3.0,This worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet. Sound was good and it was easy to set up.Good for the price and no regrets.
959,557,4.0,Bought these for home karaoke and they work great. I also have a weekend DJ business and these work well professionally. Why spend more? My DJ business includes up to 4 Shure wireless mics at around $500 a piece but these inexpensive Nady's seem just about as good in sound and performance (very few drop-outs if you stay within 30 feet of the receiver). I'll probably start taking these on gigs since they are so affordable to replace if they break.
794,557,1.0,"Pros:-Price point-Good, clean audio quality when working.-Changeable mesh ballsCons:-Limited upper frequency response (&#62;8kHz)-One stopped working after about half an hour of use. It was not dropped or abused in any way.-Requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet."
681,29,4.0,"Just a bag for my guitar stand. No big deal, but it sure makes it easier when I have all that stuff to lug around. I love my Hercules guitar stands, but they a don't like to stay put when folded up. This takes care of that problem for a couple of bags. Sturdy material, nice draw string to close it up. Shoulder strap works just fine. Glad I bought it."
1335,29,4.0,"Do you have a Hercules guitar stand? Then this will make transporting it easy. It seems like a gimmick, but I have two stands and it's nice to be able to grab both of them by using the bag straps, and still be able to carry more gear with my other hand."
240,29,2.0,If you have the full folding single stand this works quite well but the ones with the rounded neck that is one piece with no hinge are a bit tight for length.  OK quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic.  I don't understand how people can spend thousands or even hundreds on a guitar and then buy an 8 dollar stand only to see their guitar fall over or get damaged at the neck.  If you pay attention to the prices you can really get some great deals on Amazon... untouchable deals ...
81,29,2.0,Tis makes it a little awkward to carry. Overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show.
742,159,4.0,Most comfortable picks - only complaint is that I would like four in a pack. If you use all four fingers buy two sets...
480,159,4.0,"I'm used to conventional steel finger picks. These actually work really well as long as you don't play hard, like I sometimes do with my other picks. Playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks. However, these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly."
181,159,3.0,Sounds like a great concept and they seem well made. I just don't care for them. I know others love them so I guess it's just a personal thing.It took weeks to receive them in the US. Don't be in a rush.
1058,159,4.0,"I love the open feel from these picks.  It's almost like picking with with just your fingers, except with more volume."
242,159,3.0,"I decided to try these open metal finger picks when I could no longer find ProPicks, which I really like.  ProPick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar.  Compared with the ProPicks these are manufacturer from a heavier, stiffer metal.  They offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger.  I find these (and the ProPicks, for that matter) much more natural than conventional picks.  These actually have some advantages over the old ProPicks: (1) you get three finger picks, rather than two; and (2) because the metal is a heavy gauge, they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers.  It would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they're protected in the guitar case; however, they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free-ranging around in the case.  Highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar."
917,159,2.0,"Don't know what the delay was but it took forever to get here.  The picks look like they will work although they are a little hard to bend, we will see if it's what I was looking for, thanks!"
1240,159,4.0,"I play with fingernails and just can't control standard metal banjo-style fingerpicks because I can't feel the strings. I used Alaska picks for years, which are very good. These are better. They give the control of nails, yet the tone and protection of metal - and I can feel the strings! Muting, harmonics, everything...  If you play with nails and want finger picks, these are for you."
705,428,4.0,There good mics
469,428,4.0,great price and helped out with recording to a Tascam 4 track cassette (which I like using on occasion vs digital) and just plain useful with so many other apps......excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage!!!
1227,428,4.0,These microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly.  I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed.  They don't come with cables so be sure you have some available (xlr-xlr).  You can get a 25' cable for under $5 also here on Amazon.  Good deal all around.  Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to.
799,428,4.0,These mics are great. I wasn't sure what they would be like but I would buy them all again. They are cheap enough to replace and they sound great. We Shure mics and they needed repaired all the time. These have a bigger sound pick up area and they have not had any problems at all.
345,428,3.0,"I've had Behringer mikes before, and currently have a couple of XM2000s, which are very reliable and comparable to Shure SM 58s. I saw this three pack of 1800s for $40 in a hard case and couldn't believe it. I hooked them up right beside the 2000s, and while there is a little difference, it's not much. The 1800 has a little more high end, but it's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass. The presence is also boosted a little on the 1800, meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback.For now, I'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists, and keeping the older 2000s as backups.I bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one SM 58. Although the Shure (and the B 2000) is better, the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for. I can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup.A wise choice for the budget conscious."
191,428,2.0,"I got this yesterday, and everything was alright, except that two of the three Mics worked. One was dead. I tested all three of them with the same, and different cable, and made sure that the the On/Off switch was on. It was first mic I tested of the three, and the dead one of the three. Everything was good except for that one Microphone."
355,428,3.0,"These are pretty standard dynamic mics, and for what you pay the quality is good. I use them as room mics mainly, for which they perform admirably. I've only used them once for (backup) vocals, and the results were good. Would recommend these for folks on a budget. Also, the case is nice."
773,428,4.0,"Made of all metal,looks and feels well made. Sounds clear no hum or buzz comes with a nice case and that a plus."
120,428,3.0,"Surprised really. For the price I dont think I could have done better. Nice case, come with stand adapters, and make me sound pretty good and I cant really sing. Dropped one a few times and its still working. Good feel/weight. On /off switches on each. I record to DAW and the recordings sound fine. I usually run everything through a BBE so that might be part of why I am pleased with them but I do recocmmend these for mics in this price range."
468,428,3.0,"These don't sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other SM58s and Beta 58s in a band situation, but that actually wasn't the purpose of these microphones... the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system, at which they excel. The facility we use these at, the mics have a habit of walking away, or escaping maybe... stolen? Perhaps. They sound great through the ceiling, they have on/off switches, and they're cheap, we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when we're down to 1 again. Seems like they'll last forever, too bad they keep wandering off on us."
862,428,3.0,"I love these microphones, I really do. I also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice. The 2 things I did not like was 1, the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it, otherwise it does not sound as crisp. 2, although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders, the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it won't screw in. It is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an XLR Female, so buy the correct wire when connecting to an amp/speaker. For the price I really do recommend these, as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centered,and close to your mouth. Overall a great product."
564,428,4.0,"These microphones are great for recording vocals.  They pick up local sounds better than they pick up distance sounds.  They do not have any detectable noise or issues.  Depending on your situation, you may need to have a external pop-filter or windscreen, however, these microphones contain an internal windscreen."
706,428,3.0,"I use these at parties and they work good for the price I paid. I really have no complaints aside from sometimes you really have to get up on it to get a good clear voice in a live band setting. I use a wireless for that now, still for the price, these are hard to beat."
1391,428,4.0,"If you're a professional and you're JOB is music, then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality.  However, if you're just doing it as a hobby/side job... or even just want the mics for a PA system, then it's really hard to beat what you get in this deal here.  The deal is fantastic.  I use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and they've been perfect for me."
983,428,4.0,This item was received well packed and on time.  Provides a great sound for my needs and would recommend it to all my friendks.
415,428,4.0,I had some band mates that did not seem to respect my Shure SM-58 mics very well so I bought some of these cheap mics to use on them. I was very surprised to find that I like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable SM-58 (and these Behringer mic's are about 1/10 the price each.No problem with feedback or handling noiseNo problem with electronic induced noiseSounds goodDirt cheapHandy carrying caseWhat's not to like?
39,428,4.0,"My band had no PA or mics or anything.  While I admit these are not the quality a band will work up to, they fill up the stands at an affordable price.  Not much distance--you have to &#34;eat&#34; the mics--but the sound is great.  Full range, clear (not muddy), and no breaking up of sound.  This is a great place to begin."
915,428,4.0,Comes in a really nice case.  Works great.  Great price. Very light.  Can't speak to durability because haven't had them long and haven't used them heavily.
1351,428,3.0,"I was looking for a financially good deal. The price was so reasonable, I said, ""How can something this cheap be that good"",..well they were a great investment. I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone. When I told them the price, they thought I was pulling there leg,..I wasn't. The case is plastic, foam and clips. Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself. I'd buy these again in a heart beat. I just might buy another 3-pack!!"
507,428,3.0,"I bought them at 45 dollars. Use for small music gigs and DJ/MC uses. They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn't so important, as long as you can be heard and understood. I recommend for use of: 1. Small music venues (smaller bands), Djing, public speaking, band practices/rehearses, etc.For higher quality microphones at a reasonable price, look at the Audix OM2 when it's around 80 bucks, or Audio Technica products."
1049,428,4.0,"Excellent equipment!  For the price I paid, can't beat what I got.  Have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them.  It's been several years now, and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment."
244,428,4.0,Order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring. I didn't think  that these mikes would give me the quality sound I needed for the price i paid.
691,429,3.0,"...two weeks in and I can already feel it drying up. Good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled, but it seems it will cost me a fortune if I keep using these."
688,429,4.0,"THis system works great! I have a Taylor 910ce, and two other guitars I use these on - very simple and works great!"
137,429,4.0,I will no longer use other humidifying methods for my BR-243A. There's too much that can go wrong with over or under humidifying a solid wood acoustic guitar. Woods swell and shrink based on moisture vapor and it can also affect the tone quality.The beauty of these is that the gel packs maintain consistent humidity and make any changes gradually.
126,429,4.0,"I have four of these - and will continue to use this product. You'll purchase this system first, then all you need to do is get the replacement packs. For my Taylor Baby, the string spacing was a little small, but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars. Very easy to use. As a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition, I would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments."
1147,429,4.0,"I own several Taylor acoustics, and a few other kinds of guitars. I bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity (too dry). These are so easy to use, and can be &#34;recharged&#34; if you feel like $12-15 for 3 is too much every couple of months. I've successfully recharged these using distilled water about 3 times now, and they work just as great as they did new. These also come in a resealable package, so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar case.You can tell when they've dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling. It means they need to be replaced.To recharge them, I take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid (big enough to hold 1 quart), and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom. Next, I take a smaller empty ziplock container (the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich), and float it on the water in the larger container. Then place the 3 packs in the floating container (stacked on one another or on their sides) and seal the top of the larger container with a lid. It traps the humidity in the container, and the membrane on these packs is two-way, so they absorb it until they reach capacity again."
269,429,4.0,"I live in a dry climate, and I have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily.  Since I can't afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments, the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing.  I get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack.  The time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price. On the refillable humidifiers, you really can't forget more than a day or two to replenish the water.  With the humidpak, you have a lot more security.  Going on a trip?  You won't have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case."
486,429,4.0,"This thing is awesome!  I hate refilling humidifiers, and this thing is just leave it and forget it.It has a pack that hangs over the strings and in to the soundhole of the guitar, and one that restsin the case up by the headstock.I've been playing for about 15 years, and have always used a humidifier.  This works just as good as anything else.Keeps my case at a nice 60-70% humidity.I would recommend a nice Hygrometer to keep in the case too.  Just to make sure you have the proper humidity level.UPDATE 7/17/2013So being the lazy guy that I am, I never changed the packs out during the end of winter when they were getting a little hard.Well I noticed over the past couple of weeks that they were absorbing water!These really are a humidity system, rather than just a humidifier!They are almost completely back to their normal state, being very gel-like feeling.So, I am convinced that they work now."
744,429,4.0,I bought this for my Taylor 714.  It seems to keep things humidified very well.  I like the idea that it takes moisture out and puts moisture in as needed.I have replaced packs twice.  I have not had any problems with the packages leaking or creating any problems in the guitars.
1407,429,4.0,These work great keep the guitar case around 43 degrees but do not seem to last as long as they did in the past. They are easy to use.... I continue to buy them because I live in a dry region of the country.
899,429,4.0,You take the packs and put them in the sleeves. There is a double sleeve and a single sleeve. I have the double behind the neck of my guitar in its guitar case and the single behind the body. It has worked so far. It is very arid where I live and I want my fret board to be happy.
338,429,4.0,"This is a wonderfual addition to help maintain the humidity for your guitar, this product is recommended by Taylor guitars."
272,429,0.0,"They say 2-4 months, I've never come close to even a month. Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  I don't recommend these."
1385,429,4.0,"I bought this for my new 12 string Guild acoustic. I use Oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them. The reason I tried this one is because it's necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them. And with 12 strings, it really put a lot of tension on them. Another difference is there is nothing to do with the Planet Waves. You slip the included packs (2) into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings. They should last 3-4 months & you don't do anything else. Also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock. With others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they don't dry out. I also used a Dampit but because it hangs from a cord, it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acoustic-electric! I may eventually replace my Oasis humidifiers with these also."
240,429,4.0,Standard great quality from Planet Waves/D'addario but these certainly can change price very frequently throughout the year.  I think it almost doubled in price a week after I ordered... not sure why.
505,429,3.0,"Let me start off by saying I have had several types of humidifiers all of which have worked well. The major upside to this humidifier is you do not have to worry about over-humidifing your guitar! Packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use.One star short of a 5 star review. Why? The price for the replacement packets.Other than that, a wonderful system!"
476,429,4.0,"Unlike those who have complained that they dry out fast, I have always gotten much longer life out of them than the product promises. What I can't tell you is how well they actually meet humidity ideals because I've never monitored the humidity in the case to see what it is and if it is on par with what the manufacturer says. I have taken it pretty much on faith that they deliver what they say and they have read some endorsements by people like Bob Taylor of Taylor guitars that they work. Bob has too good a name and no incentive that I know of to be frivolous about endorsing such a product that might not work, so, I take it that Taylor had his lab people check them out thoroughly to be sure of Humidipaks effectiveness before Mr. Taylor would give them an endorsement. That was good enough to sell me. But I didn't just buy it because Bob Taylor says they work--they occupy a very cool niche which I was hping someone would fill. Planet Waves Humidipaks are for the person who is willing to spend a little extra to not to have to keep fiddling around with water, sponges, gauges and those Oasis water bag and just have something that you can dispose of and replace every so often. That's what I want. Sure, water is free. But it evaporates fast and it's a job to keep having to take care of. So, is it worth it to buy a disposable thing like this that you don't have to mess with? Or do you want to save $15 or so by doing all that work wetting sponges and whatnot weekly? I'll gladly pay the extra few bucks not to have to worry about hydrating my guitars and cases but once avery 6 months.None of my guitars have shown any signs of humidity issues and I have lived in New York City and Virginia Beach in the years since I've been using the Planet Waves Humidipaks. One accolade that I will give Planet Waves is that they did recall the product a few years back and promised replacements when the new model which resolved a potential leakage problem was released. That re-release seemed to drag on for a while and when I contacted Planet Waves to gripe, they sent me a check for the ""list"" price of all the units I had returned to them. Well the list price was three times the retail price at the time and that was a bit of a minor windfall at the time for me which impressed the heck out of me and I used the money to buy their other humidity products in the interim to humidify my guitars. But when the Humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements ANYWAY. That was really being treated well by Planet Waves and I have never used anything else but Humidipaks since. Humidipaks give me peace of mind that my guitars are being humidified and I'm more than satisfied with how long the paks last."
1125,471,3.0,These replaced the ETB92 nylon tapewounds I tried. I didn't realize how much low end I was missing until I put these on. Very nice.
1037,471,4.0,"My bass-playing has gone on for 50 years,...and during the time I've tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars.  I know from that experience how the quality and construction of strings has improved over the decades.This set of D'Addario chromes is remarkable.  It's a flat wound string with all the smoothness and quiet character found in that string type.  In this set, I especially like the 4th string at .100&#34; dia. This set, by its design, gives a very strong and powerful signal to the amp,...and therefore makes even my Schecter Diamond Series 4-string sound largely like the early P-bass with bottom to spare.  There's a 'however'.... and this is it,....this string is NOT muddy sounding like many flat wounds.  Clean, bold, and full of smooth overtones that work well.  I really like them.  The price is fair, and we'll see what kind of life they exhibit, as I don't want to be spending lots of hard-to-find cash on new strings at a frequency that is aggravating.Don P."
606,471,3.0,"Well, that's overstating it a little, but several people told me I wouldn't like FW strings on my bass. I wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound, smoother and more mellow. I considered RWs to be way too bright on my guitar. So I put these on my 1978 MusicMan Sting-Ray bass. I only have a little Peavey practice amp, which may account for how bright these still sound. But I love them. I have to dial the active EQ treble control all the way down, this is just a bright-sounding bass! But I wanted more of a stand-up doghouse bass sound, like early basses had. I have a low-level Hofner violin bass, also with FWs on it (it shipped with RWs,what were they thinking???), but I loves me my MusicMan. And I love the sound of these strings. Oddly, a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut, but it doesn't seem to affect the sound. As soon as I get a REAL amp, I expect these to completely satisfy. And they WILL pop, but then again, this is an awesome bass, made during Leo's time with MM. But if you want that real ""vintage"" sound, these are pretty damn good. Lack of a good amp, and not knowing how long they'll last is why I gave them 4 stars. Otherwise, 5 star all the way."
1031,471,4.0,"Yeah, i bought these for my friend' s band and their sound are really very impressive. Great durability and tone."
1425,471,4.0,"I recently picked up aSquier Fretlessbass.  As with any guitar, the factory strings left much to be desired.  With fretted basses, I'd always liked strings with a little brassiness.  But round-wounds just didn't feel (or sound) right on a fretless.  Small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction.  And round-wounds just didn't have that acoustic sound.  There were quite a few choices for fretless strings, but I've always liked D'Addarios on my 6-string guitars.  These flat-wounds were a perfect choice.  They've got plenty of bottom, but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings.  The bass sounds more like a 'real' bass.  And the action is now so smooth. I can use a small vibrato when I like--no longer restricted to the wide Jaco-style.There are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds.  But there's something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player--the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound.  As soon as I put these on, I felt like I was home."
6,204,4.0,"these are a lighter tensioned version of their popular J74 strings, the pitch is somewhat lower than the J74s and the effort needed to fret a note is much less, nice for old fingers and beginners."
952,204,4.0,"I'm primarily a guitar player, but I do have a decent mandolin that had factory strings on it.  Those strings made it hard to play, so I tried these D'Addario mandolin strings.  What a difference!  These strings are great!"
142,204,4.0,"I used to use 009 to 032 and decided to up it a size to the 010...  I like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound.  The heavier gauges such as 11's are okay too but the 012's seemed to be used a lot for the chop rhythm which I don't ascribe to. At one point I did have a set of Bluegrass 012's on it but they didn't feel right for me plus I didn't like the way the 012's sat on top the nut, I was a bit worried that the nut would crack, which is what happens when the gauges are too fat for the nut slot.IF you want 012's I would highly recommend you take it to a tech so he can evaluate the nut and slot it to the proper width to accommodate the 012.The reason I switched from 009 to 010 is that I was hard pressed and in need of a set and the local music shop didn't carry the 009's any longer so I went to the 010.  I believe my mando was set up with 10's or 11's but I wasn't sure.  I tweaked the action and the 010's are fine and I've made the adjustment.Strings, ahem....  are just about all the same.  They local music shop is very knowledgeable and they told me a story around NAMM shows and how the string booths don't really give out too much info and the origins of their products.  There may be (according to the my local music shop) a few companies that actually make their own strings but the bulk of the strings out there are probably manufactured in a mass quantities at factories in PRC or other offshore sources, sold in bulk and packaged by the companies.  Who knows?  And the shop sure tried to find out but it's a dark dark secret out there at the trade shows, so nobody is talking, and making a logical assumptions from a corporate standpoint are probably not too far off the mark, i.e.  Strings are mass produced for market and most string companies as I said earlier are buying bulk and packaging for the consumers.What does that mean?  That means I need some inside info to this bulk purchasing and I'll sell my own!  The quality is probably up as much as the tooling and raw materials will allow, so why not!Cheers!"
1252,204,4.0,"Good strings. Light... but I'll be going to coated strings next.  The coated ones are Medium, which is too heavy for me."
931,204,4.0,"In my 13 years of playing the guitar I have settled on D&#8217;Addario as my string of choice.  When I picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy. I&#8217;m really glad I did.  The tone is great, they&#8217;re durable and smooth on the fingers.  Even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell-like tone that mandolinists are after.  They respond great to different styles and dynamic levels.  You can play sweet classical passages, roaring bluegrass and even rock.  I have a high end Washburn F-Style and these strings coupled with Wegan picks make the Washburn sound SPECTACULAR!  They also bring out the sound of the wood too which I appreciate.  If you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good, this is the pack to get. Thanks D&#8217;Addario for providing an awesome product!"
1416,204,4.0,"The strings definitely have a good tone, though I've got them on a low-end mandolin. They may be more than the mando needs. But they sound great!"
9,204,4.0,The strings are slightly smaller than the J74 and deliver a great sound.  Several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound.  My reply was to purchase a set and give them a try.  Thanks Again
246,527,3.0,"so i just got this product, haven't used it!package looks ok,strings are pakced in one plastic bagi can't wait to try this one, i've also bought Martin M1400, ghs silk and steel, will come back with results!"
672,527,4.0,these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing.  They have a great sound for finger picking and even with a pick they still sound good.
1244,527,3.0,"The strings on my new Yamaha FG700S were too hard and noisy so I ordered these and what a difference in the feel!  Playing went from painful to pure pleasure!  I did notice that the tone of the low E string was a bit dead, especially in drop D tuning so I put that one Yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows.  For that, I gave four stars instead of five."
809,527,3.0,"These strings are well packaged, and easy to unroll and string on my guitar. I've had them on two guitars for a couple of months and they hold their tone well."
1225,527,4.0,"No strings I've tried are like this, it doesn't have a strong character but work together with your guitar. My seagull now sound mellow with brightness! Also this string is perfect for finger picking, I love it!"
242,527,3.0,"These D'Addario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking.  A couple of notes, though:  (1) on the positive side, they are made in the U.S.A. of American-produced materials (unlike silk and steel strings by a famous American guitar company whose name starts with ""M,"" which are assembled south of the border); (2) on the negative side, they cost more than M-----'s silk and steel strings; (3) in general, silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings, especially more than flat-wound acoustic strings; (4) the tone is very nice and mellow, sort of a cross between flat-wound steel strings and nylon strings; (5) the D'Addario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot, or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion; (6) they really work best for finger picking (whatever you do, don't use metal finger picks), and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking."
346,527,4.0,"I like these strings for their warm & mellow tone.  They are easy on the fingers, and I prefer the silver-wound basses."
644,125,4.0,"I bought this to replace an actual full-out PA and was VERY pleasantly surprised.Pros: GREAT price, VERY loud (as well as clear). Also compact and very durable.Cons: None.Bottom Line: As a monitor look no further. I use it as a PA for practicing and it is a God-send. Buy now!"
91,125,4.0,"I was looking for a small, high quality monitor for use in the Praise Band at church. I needed to run my Boss GT-100 and vocals through it on stage. This little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume. It is built extremely well/very solid and sounds incredible. The volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing. I still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and I do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor. There is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom, but I place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my DI box underneath it. Between this and my GT-100 I have the ultimate direct guitar system, with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board. Simply fantastic piece of equipment."
516,125,4.0,"One of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track. A pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs. They can  be configured as a master/slave set-up with a single link cable (a 1/4 inch speaker cable), or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs, assuming five inputs per CM-30. In reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient.The low, mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ. I have run both aRoland RD-300NX Digital PianoandRoland V-Combo VR-700. The grand piano setting on the RD-300NX sounds like the real thing out of this amp, as does the B3 emulation from the V-Combo.I did a direct comparison with this against aMackie SRM150 5.25-Inch Compact Active PA Systemand the sound of this beat it hand's down. Bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range.Vocals through the channel with the XLR are adequate, but not particularly spectacular. Also, there is no phantom power or ground lift features, so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances. That leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances.I use mine as a powered main, but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box. That is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you. However, once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument's volume and EQ controls.There are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand. First, the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the CM-30 to the floor not exceed 43 inches. I agree. This may be relatively small, but it's heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high. It's easy to tip over, especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended."
678,125,3.0,"I play guitar and sing in relatively small places, such as cafes.  I previously used a Fender Acoustasonic Jr and I got tired of lugging it (about 50 lbs) and all of my other gig equipment around. With the CM-30 I can get it (12 lbs), mic stands, music stand, mic, and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel.  That means I can haul everthing I need in one trip.  A big plus.I like the sound quality I get.  My guitar is an acoustic Alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a Shure SM-57.  The Roland doesn't have a huge amount of volume, but if you're looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport, set up and take down, this is a good choice. (If I used it a with a passive guitar pick-up, I'd want external preamp.)  Think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room.I'm also thinking I will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my Acoustasonic Jr.It looks really rugged, so I'm looking forward to years of happy use."
318,125,4.0,"I'm frankly sick and tired of showing up for a gig and having my keyboard run through the P.A., thereby in essence causing me to forfeit all control of the instrument to the bandleader (or board op). Still, I've had to concede that the amps I've been using--a Roland KC150, then a KC350--had plenty of power and pop but no sonic attributes that would recommend them above the Bose P.A. set-up the band uses.  Then, because I needed a small amp with an XLR connection for use as an emergency P.A., I picked up this relatively new item from Roland, which prominently describes itself as a ""monitor"" amp (i.e. meant only for the performer's ears).Was I surprised when I got this thing home and put it through some rounds with a Kurzweil PC2 and SP2.  It's little more than a compact brick, but it appears to have the power of my KC150 and, more importantly, in terms of ""listenability"" it sounds like its several heavens apart from the KC 150 or 350 (those ever-present Roland KC amps will make any piano, including Rolands, sound uninspiring if not boring during the course of a four-hour gig).  This latest contender covers the entire piano range, effortlessly, smoothly, providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed and brilliant but not strident highs.  Perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle ""colored.""  If so, I'll take the coloration any day to the untempered sounds I've been getting from electric keyboards.  The mid-range is tight and controlled, with the upper register ""growing out"" of it gradually but unmistakably.  By contrast, the upper register on the heavy-duty KC amps strikes like a serpent, leaping out of the mix like home-brewed white lightning  hitting the palate after it's just gotten accustomed to a vintage Bordeaux.I even compared this little thing to my previous standard--the Roland Cube 60 that had preceded the KC150 (which has been around too long).  This new one was smoother, bending to the bass notes like a gracious willow and springing to the top ones like fresh spring birch.  In other words, even the Roland Cube sounded uneven and rough compared to this latest overachiever, which handled the tones of the scale like a single portamento, revealing no holes in any of the registers.Playing any instrument or amplifier on the job can lead to a judgment radically different from the one made at home.  If my instruments (I'm usually playing 2-3) have to be mixed through the P.A., fine.  I won't have to listen to them.  They'll be processed by this monitor, which will be facing and playing for me before it kicks out the stuff that the bandleader deems worthy of the public's ears."
1368,860,0.0,"I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the ""Top"" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat)."
34,860,3.0,"Didn't purchase this pedal from Amazon, but wanted to write a review. I wasn't expecting much from this pedal, but it is quite good. Is it a completely authentic acoustic sound? I'd have to say... not exactly. But it's kind of close, and it's a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master, which still sounds distinctly electric. So far, the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the Jumbo setting. Again, don't expect to sound completely acoustic -- it's a nice way to at least approach that sound. Check out some Youtube tests before buying.It's &#34;okay&#34; on my Blues Jr. NOS, but really shines on my Crate TD-35, which is a brighter amp and less colored. I zero the spring verb and use the pedal's onboard reverb for best results.Used it with my Strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a Duncan Hotrod set. Sounds good with both guitars -- especially neck and center positions.Pedal is solid. Be advised that it comes with the 9-volt from the factory, so if you use a DC power source then you'll want to remove the battery. To do so, you'll see a black knob at the base of the pedal. Just unscrew it, pop the hood, and remove the battery. Overally, solid pedal as you'd expect from Boss.A word of warning. Not sure if it's my setup, but when the AC-3 is in my effects chain (not a loop, but in front of the Blues Jr), I started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning -- burnt tube or the like. When I run it alone to my Crate, I haven't experienced this. Could be any number of things in my effects chain, so check if others experience this.I'm wondering if a small, cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal. Never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp. Not sure how a non-piezo pickup would affect the tone. Anyone know about this?"
306,860,3.0,"I guess the term toppy describes the sampling range, which picks up the higher notes. If you want to get the right effect, this is a good choice. For those of us, who find acoustic guitars difficult to play, this is solution. Personally I have a lazy blues style and my attempts to play acoustic guitars, too often feels like I am using a manual typewriter. This product does what it says on the box, but sounds better using hum bucker pickups, or if you play a strat, it sounds very good on the middle or neck pickup. Don't use the bridge pickup, as it doesn't sound too good."
1194,860,2.0,"The Boss AC-3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator. I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. The AC3 does that job. Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful. Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.The key to using this pedal is using it correctly.First and foremost: use single coils. Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD).The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone. I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case. If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly."
197,860,1.0,"SummaryAcoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. I returned it. Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.Pros- Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me."
1401,309,4.0,"As with all Boss / Roland products, the Boss FS-6 performs as designed. I purchased it to control both my Boss ME 20 Multi effects pedal and my Fender Blues Jr amp. The A switch (in non latching mode) allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my ME 20 and the B switch (in latching mode) allows me engage and disengage the FAT (overdrive) switch on my Blues Jr Amp. Everything works exactly as planned. The FS-6 rugged, compact (fits right into my into ME 20 carrying case) and easy to use.I read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries...something to complain about. As with most guitar players I don't use batteries in my effects pedals I use an 9 volt AC/DC adapter. Visual Sound offers the ""One Spot"" AC/DC adapter kit that has a 9 volt battery snap connector adapter. I removed the battery cover, then using a small rat tail file I carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through. I then put rubber feet (purchased at ACE Hardware) on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable...battery problem solved.I also use the FS-6 as a sustain pedal for my Yamaha YPG 225 portable grand piano and a control for my RC-3 Loop Station simultaneously. The possibilities are limited only to your imagination. It is somewhat expensive but it is a Great Product!! If you need a duel switch then I highly recommend purchasing the FS-6."
722,309,4.0,"I needed a footswitch for a variety of applications to include an acoustic amp, guitar amps, and other guitar/audio gear.  Built like a tank and completely configurable.  Well done again, Roland!"
1396,309,0.0,"I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp.  The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site."
116,309,4.0,"I use this pedal in tandem with my APC-40 and map the buttons to various controls in Ableton.  The foot switch opens the door to more organic sound live performances with a prepared track.  The polarity switches are nice, however the momentary/latch switches are what makes this unit so compatible with my DAW. Some functions such as play and stop are momentary functions, other functions such as track on/off are toggle/latch functions.  Without a foot switch that can toggle between the two, applications are limited certain functions.  I use the footswitch for a variety of applications, in a variety of songs with different arrangements.  If I could hook up more than one of these to my controller, I'd have about four of them, but the one is so nice on its own."
783,309,4.0,I bought it to use with my Boss ME-70. I use the to go up and down through my banks I have programmed on the ME-70. Build like a tank. Simply to use. Simply to hook up. I hear it can be used on other Boss and Roland gear.
1387,309,3.0,"Works well.  Very well constructed.  Would it kill ya to add an on/off switch so that the batteries don't run down?  Other than that, it's perfect!"
748,309,4.0,"being new to guitar this is just way too much fun, makes my playing acutally sound like I may know what I am doing, easy to setup and easy to use"
350,737,3.0,Could be more tapered for such a tiny pick. But the material is AWESOME. Nice grip even more so when I sweat.
1156,737,4.0,The yellow material has a rough texture coated over it that gives it a nice rubbery grip with a smooth snappy tone!
952,737,3.0,"Nice picks.  A bit small for my preference.  Great for picking, kind of harsh for strumming,  Quality seems top-notch.  Some guitarists will love these."
263,737,3.0,I have moved on to the Carbon Fiber and 3mm Lexan Jazz III picks but these Ultex picks are also very nice.  They are a little less bright than the Carbon Fiber Picks which in some cases is actually preferrable.  In my opinion (At least at the moment) the Jazz III picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy.  Once you get used to the small size there is no going back.  The large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator.
733,737,4.0,"This Ultex Jazz 3 it's very cool, your durability is very high and I'm feel very comfortable to play with it..."
1309,737,4.0,"If you are fan of the Jazz III you will definitely like the Ultex version.  From my experience, the Ultex has the sound and feel of Tortex but without the ""memory"" aka wear.  The Ultex is thicker than the standard nylong Jazz III's and only when directly compared will you notice that the Ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surface.Five stars for being a better Jazz III.  However, the prices for these on amazon are absurd.  I got mine through musiciansfriend for around $2 shipped."
980,737,4.0,"I already liked the Jazz 3 picks by Dunlop, these made from the Ultex material sound so much better, and the surface of the pick is nice,even with sweaty fingers,they stay put. I do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick. Sweet !!!!! These are clear yellow picks I would love to see them in red, that would be brutal!!!!"
1345,737,4.0,"IDK why GC does not carry these. Annoying. Great pick! Worth buying a baggie. If you like the ultex feel but hate the in store larger only ones, get these."
618,737,4.0,"Firm pick, just the perfect size and keeps a sharp tip.  Once you try these picks you never go back."
921,737,4.0,"This is a nice pick, thicker and easy to hold on to.  I like the size (smaller than your regular picks) and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar."
774,737,4.0,"A very nice pick, both in feel and texture (the design is a bit boring, though). Only complaint is that it's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece, where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece. But that's okay. I got this the same time as I got a set of Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks, and I think I like the Dava picks the best. All three are &#34;tight grip&#34; picks, and all the same size - they're all good, though - I'd rate this one next-best, and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that)."
1071,737,4.0,"Great picks, not just for Jazz though. I play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles. Takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel, but once you do they are fantastic."
15,293,3.0,I have always trusted the Graph Tech TUSQ products and this is no different.  The compensation for this saddle was almost spot on with little adjustment needed.
1363,293,4.0,"I replaced a bone non-compensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this.This is a convenient product as the thing is already close to final thickness you need, you don't need to change the compensation much if at all,  the material sands easier than bone, polishes well, and the tone is really good.A little careful sanding/polishing and the guitar was ready to play. I like the product."
995,293,4.0,"I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. This left the saddle too low to the neck.  I researched the ""Tusq"" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try.  I'm pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain.  I'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on."
248,293,1.0,"When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. This is NOT worth the money."
799,321,4.0,I purchased the plastic and it worked fine but the notes were not as distinguished as the TUSQ. I did have to sand to make it fit. That may sound badm but I am glad because it's better than too small. I did not purchase this from amazon but sweetwater in case you were wondering.
15,321,3.0,"The compensation built into this saddle makes another hit with GraphTech TUSQ products for me.  They have done the hard work, just needed some personal fine adjustments and good to go.  Good sound quality for not being bone."
212,321,3.0,I selected this to replace the cheap plastic Saddle that came on my Fender acoustic. This was a tremendous upgrade and made a difference in the tone and 'brightness' of the sound. This was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions.
224,321,4.0,"I installed this saddle in my Silvertone SD10.  If you have a lower end guitar, this will make a huge difference.  I had to sand it down some in all directions.  I did the length first, then thickness and finally the height.  I used 220 grit sandpaper. The directions are in the package."
1034,321,2.0,"This is a great product, just not for me. I found it brightened my tone way too much and I went back to plastic. Gave my guitar a bad metallic sound, and I lost bottom end."
252,321,4.0,A little patients sanding the saddle to fit my 1973 vintage Guild (better fit than the plastic original that it replaced!) and the sound expanded beyond my expectations! I also replaced the bridge pins with Tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone.
1196,321,4.0,The GraphTech PQ-9280-C0 TUSQ Fully Compensated Acoustic Guitar Saddle will replace any broken or worn saddle to give you a very food sound that may require just a little sanding to make it fit perfect for your guitar.
1089,321,4.0,"Having recently purchased an Epiphone EL-00 I went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to Graph Tech's Tusq material. It is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with. The top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the Tusq bridge and pins, the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional. This was one of the best modifications I have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments. I have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade...I can barely wait. I highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice."
1032,321,4.0,i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love.  i decided to replace the saddle with this one.. and it required some dremeling/sanding to get it to sit correctly.  it was easy to do - and now my guitar has no buzzing on any of the frets and it sounds great with new strings.  it also brightened up the saddle/bridge because my old saddle was turning yellow and not too nice looking.  this one is an ivory-ish color and it is really nice.
64,321,4.0,"Installed this on an old Aria dreadnough I found in a dumpster.Cleaned it up,buffed the finish out,tweaked the truss rod a bit and installed this saddle with new Dunlop .012's and this is one of my prize acoustic's now.Thanx GraphTech!"
1396,899,4.0,"Got to admit I was a little intimidated by the installation process when I was shopping for this pickup.  But when I got the box I was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions (not too long, not too short) along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly.  The jig method is super easy and provided great results.  I was really excited to try out the pickup so I plugged it into my Roland AC-33 and let her rip, it was awsome, very full and very representative of my guitars sound.  K&K you have a convert in me.  I am now thinking about trying this on my Martin!"
486,899,4.0,"So based on the reviews from Amazon, and a friend who swears by these pickups, I decided to put one into my 310 Taylor.I am extremely pleased!  This was my brother's guitar, and he had a Mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop.  It sounded terrible.  I tried messing with placement to get it to sound better, but it just didn't sound good, had tons of feedback, and just didn't have a good feel.I installed this pickup myself.  I have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars, and this one was pretty painless.I didn't have to drill out the endpin hole, so it only took me about 20 minutes to install this bad boy.When I tested it out I was blown away.  It sounded beautiful!  Just like my Taylor, only louder!The true test was an actual live performance.  I brought my Baggs Para Acoustic D.I. and I was glad I did.I was able to adjust the EQ just a tad, cut some of the mid-range a bit, and it sounded even better!I could not believe it.  It literally gave me chills.If you're on the fence about this pickup, go for it!  The reviews don't lie, this sounds fantastic, especially if you can EQ it a bit.I did plug in without the PADI, just to test it and it still sounded good.  If I forgot my PADI I would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system.  It might be labeled as passive, but it's got the volume of an active system for sure!It's a great buy in my opinion."
905,899,4.0,"I put this in a $200 guitar.  I have a Recording King (RD-06) that sounds so good, that I wanted to use it for live gigs.  So I popped in this K&K.  I ran it through my SWR California Blonde II acoustic amp.  If you have been wanting an acoustic guitar to have that &#34;miked&#34; when you plug it in, this is as close as it gets!  I recommend getting a sound-hole cover if you play with a band, but you will not be disappointed.  The installation can be a little tricky, but with a little patience and reading, anybody can install it.  If you don't feel comfortable, just go pay a local luthier to install it for $30, or ask your grandmother for help :P"
281,899,3.0,"This pick-up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically.  It does pick up percussive noise which you don't get with under saddle pickups.  It is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don't use a sound hole cover.  Over all I'm please because I was able to install myself and it was simple.  You do need to use an external pre-amp, but even with piezo pick-ups that is usually the norm.  The directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions.  The only change I had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too."
933,899,4.0,"Installed one on my CF Martin, almost leaving a thumb super-glued to the inside of the guitar. An interesting experience - would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar. I'm sure that some of my DNA still resides in the guitar.Bought another for my brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the CF Martin through a brand new Kustom Sienna Pro30 acoustic guitar amp from Amazon. I've read that folks prefer the K&K; over the made-for-the-GS-Mini-Taylor-pickup.Get it."
1312,899,1.0,Disapointed. The sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound. It sound muffled. I will have to replace it soon.
164,899,3.0,"I use a late 70's yamaha steel string with this going into an LR Baggs Para DI and it works amazingly well. The sound is impeccable. But you can't expect to just plug it in and go. You'll need a feedback buster and a good preamp. But it really does the job, good tone."
1038,84,4.0,I bought this to have at home or when I travel; my full size stand stays at church. I have a new Martin 12-string that I did not want lying on the floor. This folds flat (maybe 2&#8221; thick) has a wide secure base and fits in the bag I carry my other gear in quite well.
1271,84,2.0,"The Hercules Travlite Guitar Stand is an average stand in my opinion.  It does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but I'd keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner, if you value your guitar.  Not a specific knock on the Hercules but most low and portable stands like this, are the same, they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down.  You may be careful around it, but it's hard to say for others nearby.  For a cheap guitar, I wouldn't mind using this, but for a more expensive guitar, no thanks.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
1338,84,4.0,"I own two Hercules GS302B stands for my electric guitars, and I couldn't be happier with them. When I needed an acoustic stand I turned to the Hercules GS301B and have no regrets. At the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars. Not only do stands have to hold guitars securely, they shouldn't harm the finishes of the instrument. Unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higher-end guitars; since I have two guitars of this nature, protecting them was of the utmost import to me. Fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes, and I have never had problems with mine. The stands themselves (both varieties) fold up to be very compact if you need portability, and support the guitar very securely. I don't gig with these guitars, so portability was not paramount to me, but stability was: these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy (mine reside on a carpeted floor, and I have never had any issues with them tipping over.) Some people may not love the yellow and black ""bumble bee"" coloration, but I actually find it whimsically industrial. I am completely happy with all three of my Hercules stands: they are safe, portable, rugged, and won't hurt the finish on most guitars. If I need another guitar stand, it's a good bet I will buy another Hercules."
201,84,4.0,"This is a nice, sturdy well made guitar stand.  It is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly."
413,84,3.0,"This thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand.  Of course one might think that would translate into sturdy, and one would be correct.  Super simple to use.  No buttons, levers, or knobs. Just pop it open.  It doesn't have an actual mechanical locking feature, but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place.  It holds my acoustic securely, and I have no fear that it's going to tip over on its own.  When you're done, just nudge the outer legs to ""unlock"" them and it's super easy to fold back up.I had a Fender mini acoustic stand, but it didn't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so I figured I would try this one.  I am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter.  HOWEVER..... I can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2.75"" thickness.  If Hercules could have figured a way to avoid that, this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine.  It's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag, but I think the Marketing guys used a little creative license with that description.  (Either that or they're comparing it to the Cosmo year end recap issue.) Still a great little stand and I would buy it again if needed."
1236,138,2.0,"I was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband.This product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the 1/4&#34; port (the product specs does not show or say 1/4 plug port).My product has an orange USB light instead of a blue one. The support people at Behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo (sounds like BS to me).The problem I had and the reason I bought this is that I tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a 1/4-1/8 adapter chord. It works but the levels are too low. When I received this, I was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are, but not by much. It is a step up from the adapter, but far from professional. I'd say the level is beginner/intro level sound and quality.I bought a &#34;like new&#34; product describing faded or damaged packaging. When it arrived, the pkg box was dented (I don't care) and product looked new inside. But, all the instructions described a blue USB light and CD of driver and recording software which this did not come with. Behringer gave me a link to download. I assure you it's crapware and beware. For the mac, garageband is far better and easier to use.Rock out!"
1303,138,3.0,"This product has turned out to be great with few exceptions.  It comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three, not true.  The license included only works for one amp, the AC box combo and not the other two, you need to purchase the license for them.  Plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor.  You cannot run the output through your sound card to your PC speakers due to latency.  You must use the headphone jack on the interface.  In addition if you are in an austere environment and can't get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work.  Once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product."
1335,138,4.0,I use this to practice at my computer to keep from disturbing my wife when she is studying or my daughter when she is sleeping. Great little box!
190,138,4.0,"I ordered this so I could plug my guitar into my computer and record music. Works well. Quality German manufacturing as always. Nice. I would definitely recommend this. It worked with my windows 7 starter, Acer netbook."
1157,138,2.0,"The Behringer UCG102 device is an aging (yet affordable) piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the USB port of a computer.  This opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones.  For the budget player, it could be argued that a mere $32 investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilities.However, while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly, there are some significant problems here.  First and foremost, there is the problem of getting the device to work, getting the software to recognize it, and configuring it to run without significant ""latency"" (which is a delay effect where you don't hear a played note immediately when it's played, which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible).  The UCG102 runs on an ASIO driver.  They include an older version with the software, and you can snoop around online and find other options.  But that doesn't mean it will necessarily work with your software, or work well if it does.  For example, Audacity is a popular ""freeware"" program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer.  I've been told that Audacity doesn't work with ASIO drivers, and when I got it to record, the latency issues rendered it unusable.You do receive two other software options with the device.  The first is energyXT2, which I believe includes a license for the compact version.  In theory, this program should work like Audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects, in addition to drum and bass track loops.  However, I have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program.  I'm sure it CAN work, but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out, that's really not ideal for a budget product.The second item is a trial disc with Guitar Combos by Native Instruments.  So far, this has been the most impressive of the options offered.  You can demo three different amp simulators (Vox, Fender, and Marshall) and then enter a code to unlock one of the three.  I like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp, which allows you to dial in some realistic tones.  It's also the only program I've been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in (there are problems with recognizing mono vs. stereo).  I adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to 8 miliseconds, which is just into the range where I don't notice it as a problem.  Still, while the models sound good, I'm not sure how often I would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recording.Shortly after ordering this device, I discovered that my sound card has a blue ""line in"" audio jack on the back.  By running a simple 1/8"" to 1/4"" audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card, I can do direct recording, which is monitored through my computer speakers (no latency) and sounds great.  Even better, this method works through Audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks.  If the UCG102 worked as advertised, it would be a more convenient way of doing this, but I simply can't recommend it for most people.  I feel like there's ""4-star"" potential somewhere in this device, but I doubt I'll ever have the patience to unlock it.  3 stars."
64,138,1.0,"..it works.But expect some flaws.First,finding a driver to use was a pain.It doesn't come with a software disc,so look on Behringer's support site for driver download.Whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio,you can't run any other media player and get sound.My advice is unless you have a dedicated PC or laptop for using this...get something else."
1326,182,3.0,"It is a good price, works fine to connect my wha wha pedal to my ampli.4 stars because nothing is perfect but I'm happy with it"
481,182,3.0,Works fine.  Good value
658,182,4.0,"I use this cable a lot, and it has stood the test of time. If it matters to you, the white ends are very, well, white. They look nice in the product photos, but sometimes clash with certain guitars and stomp boxes colors/designs. Just saying..."
276,182,4.0,"This cable is quality, no crackling, strong connections and hard metal. Maybe not top of the line but definitely acceptable."
166,182,4.0,I like this cable for it has an angled plug. It is not that long but no complaints. It works as it should and does well.
1398,182,4.0,wish i would have bought  4 of the 20 footersgoing to buy more of them for sure they are great guitar cables
13,182,4.0,i use this cable to patch a preamp to an amp.  it works really well.  having the two different style of ends gives you good options when putting a system together.
1222,182,3.0,Not too much to say about a cable.  It worked out of the box...no shorts or noises. The jacket on the straight plug was partly unscrewed and that's a continuing problem with these cords.  I use some thread-lock on them.  I find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things.
1269,182,3.0,"I use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp. I do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new. I was initially concerned when I first received the cable that it would not last. The cable is not as fat as I had hoped, however the ends are solid and sturdily built. I usually use Mogami Gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so, if that long.  This Hosa Cable is a very good cable and I even chose to use Hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals. They last."
682,182,4.0,"Believe this 5 feet Cable is no small thing. The Jacks are high quality construction. Very very durable. The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable. I plan on enjoying this Cable for many many years. I'm glad I bought it, and thanks to Amazon who made it available."
262,182,3.0,works great and to me its cheap. cant see why you would buy a more expensive guitar cable.Highly recomended
140,182,2.0,"I thought I was buying the 10 footer and realize I ordered the 5 footer too late.  Let's be honest here, what good is a 5 foot amp chord unless you're sitting on the amp?  My bad..I never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the 10 footers as it does for the 5 footers.  I would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet."
1097,182,4.0,"If you need a well made cable in a short length, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these.  Buy one now."
17,182,2.0,5 feet is a weird length for a cable. It really only has one use: When you're sitting right next to your practice amp. Just don't wander too far off! This cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his/her guitar lesson and has to plug in.I bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between. I feel chained to my workstation. Just my experience. Get a 10 foot and be free!Hope it helps.
1156,182,4.0,"These cables are VERY good. The metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins. There is no play when I plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight- that is, the pin diameter is perfect! There's also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue (which is how I lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice)"
902,182,3.0,"I used to have bulk 18 gauge wire, and Switchcraft jacks, to make my own cables. These Hosa cables probably use 22 to 24 gauge wire, but are adequate for the price. The heat shrink strain reliefs are adequate as well. I recommend tightening the housing, because everyone of mine were loose."
952,182,3.0,"This cable seems top-notch to me.  Some complaints I heard had to do with this brand not lasting.  (Of course, those guys abuse their equipment.)  Maybe that will be something I'll encounter, but this cable appears to be very well made--and it works great.  I take very good care of my gear, so I expect this one to last.  Only gave it four out of five because I'd rate some other cables slightly higher.  This a great cable, the length is perfect for practice, and I'd buy another."
878,182,4.0,a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item if you are a truly music chosen one
342,182,3.0,Awe... it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself. But I did buy another that I still have but it is still in it's original packaging as a back up for my other cords. Until i break it out and use it hard for 6 months I have nothing else to say here.
794,182,4.0,"Construction and Use: 5/5The connectors and shielding on these cables are good and do not introduce much noise into a system.The manufacturer has done a good job on this cable, but the user is responsible for two things (this addresses complaints I see in other reviews):1) Take care of your cables. The right angle plug side is much stronger than the straight plug side; this is by design. Take good care of your cables and it should last you quite a long time. This includes taking the time to store them for use.2) Make sure you know what length you need for a cable. The shorter the cable, the better for studio use. It reduces signal travel time and potential for interference (though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot). If you need a longer cable, buy a longer cable. Don't buy what is advertised as 5' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15' cable."
340,182,4.0,"Bought two for a shockingly low price that I couldn't beat anywhere- even at double the price. Quality cable, sturdy  user serviceable connectors, well constructed, and 6 months of daily use with no issues. What more can you ask for?"
356,182,4.0,Bought these to replace the ones that I had previously ordered from another vendor.  These have good shielding not like the others.
1303,182,2.0,I've purchased several of these in different lengths and styles and never had a problem but this one is giving me some minor difficulties with connection.  Like a loose connection.
627,182,4.0,"I will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp. The quality is great, price is right and delivered on time."
155,182,4.0,This is a great cable at a good price. I works well without the extra noise you get with some cheap cables. I have been playing guitar for many years and would recomend this cable.
1304,182,2.0,"This cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp. I noticed how thin the cable is, but the length is good for my needs. I  have played through the cable once and found it sub par compared to my other cables, which are professional grade and cost a lot more, but this is a cheap cable and sounds like any other cable of this caliber. I use the right angle to hook up to my jazz  bass during rehearsal where long cables at times bunch up and become cumbersome in a studio setting."
621,182,4.0,"Showed up in two days and it works great, looks solid, nice construction, quality cord w/ right angle for $7, yea!! :D"
450,182,4.0,"This is good for the money.  It is short, but works with the small amp that I purchased.  I am done"
134,182,4.0,"These are good quality cables at an economical price. The difference between Hosa, and my high end cables are barely noticeable. The cable shipped fast, and I couldn't be more pleased."
915,182,4.0,Unless you're going to get a very expensive professional chord this is just as good as any other and works great for medium sized venues.
948,182,1.0,"In fact, I don't think this Hosa GTR215R cord lasted 2 hours. One step on the cord and it came apart. This purchase is the very reason why I'm looking to buy a wireless system. Maybe if you're using this to run a PA I would recommend it. But if any performer is hard on their cords I wouldn't recommend this item....but to be fair, I would recommend wireless to any performer. You'll end up saving money over the long haul."
609,182,4.0,This little cable gets used on my practice amp. I love the 90 degree connection. The overall quality seems good and I have had no problems.
247,182,4.0,"Let me be upfront. I often use my electric guitar unplugged. When I am plugged in, I don't move around a lot. So this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing. But no hum or noise and seems solid. It was very affordable. Can't say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time, but for the price, I can not complain at all. I suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage."
1002,182,4.0,"One for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great.  I probably didn't need the 15' length, but at the time, this was the only really good cable with 90* angles."
763,182,4.0,I got this because I was adding a Pedal to my practice amp.  This runs from my Guitar to the pedal.  Works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal.  This is actually my best cable and I think I will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these
1048,182,3.0,This is great for adding pedals. You cant go wrong for this item with the price even more so thank you
268,182,3.0,"been using it for a month or 2 now.. had absolutely no problems..good constructio,looks good..angled end is a good fit..price is good."
1030,297,4.0,"cheaper and as good as if they were original Gibson, fit well and look well, tune well everything, get them!"
1376,297,4.0,"I bought a set of these to upgrade my Kona K1ETRD, a vast improvement over the old ones, now it stays in tune better and they're very smooth, looks nice too!"
135,297,4.0,They are grovers.  They keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock.  I like the vintage look of these and they go great with my Gibson custom SG.  I have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars.
1341,297,3.0,"The low-E tuner on my 1985 LP Standard broke about a week ago - the back came off and the tuning handle popped out. I never liked the ones that were on it but I didn't want to drop the $$$ unless I needed to. I came across these Grovers. They had good reviews and the price was right.Took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and re-string the guitar. The tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever. They also feel more sturdy than the ones I just replaced. It's hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as I haven't had them on for long enough - they *seem* better, though, as the B string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly.I decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these Grovers - they fit better (i.e. tighter). Nothing wrong with the new screws, I just like my stuff to be snug. :)I like them and glad I purchased them - so far."
664,736,4.0,"I've tried pretty much every harp out there, after having played the regional blues & jazz circuit for about 10 years.  Lee Oskar harps are the best value.On top of it, Lee Oskar actually called me once just because I left a question on his website!I've met Rick Epping (of Hohner harmonicas) at NAMM -great guy- but he never called me at 3:30 in the afternoon just because I could not identify a song I thought he was playing on!I carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig, so that is at least $290 for a set of Lee Oksar harps.10 Suzuki Manji harps, while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great, would cost nearly $480 - presuming you could find them.I will not say I've never blown a reed on a LO, but I will say that $22 for a new set of LO reed plates beats $48 for a new Manji, at least in my book.On top of it, all they really did with the Manji is discontinue the ""Bushman Delta Frost"" harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price.Lee Oskar harmonicas are inexpensive, they are simple and cheap to repair, easy to play, have great tone, and are even easy to identify since the 1st & 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb.  That feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet.Give them a shot."
131,736,4.0,"what a nice clear sound it has,,and smooth ,,,nice size for someone with small hands , i got this because of all the good things people wrote about  it in the reviews, sense i always wanted to play ,so decided to learn ,,and wasn't shore what kind to get ,,so thanks for all the reviews to help me out ,, and i am so glad i got this one it came in a nice plastic case ,not a cardboard box, all throw i did order a case for it,( witch i will use) when i bought this Harmonica,, not shore what harmonica to get on a low budget ,,this is the one,,you won't regret it,, i been around blue's  a long time so heard many harmonica's  ,this one truly sounds good,,"
151,736,3.0,"I bought this and a Hohner Special 20 key of C harp to test them both out. This harp is a great harp, pretty much the exact same as the Hohner Special 20 in overall quality. ""Feels"" a little more airtight, brighter and louder than the hohner, but in side-by-side testing the effect is diminished.The Hohner Special 20 just seems to have this little extra...expression to it. More life or something.Both harps very bendable, etc. Real high quality.As for the replaceable reed plates...Amazon has this harp marked down to about the $25 level. Reed plate replacements are about $19. Now I realize that at retail that's half the price of a RETAIL harp, but only $6 less than a ""whole new harp"" otherwise.With this in mind, I would generally recommend beginners start with the Hohner Special 20. Just a slightly better or at least more fun-sounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available ""free"", in my opinion."
697,736,3.0,"My son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in Europe during WW I. Needless to say, I did not want to pass this on to him yet. I figured he could start simpler. I read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument. It has a great tone. Its construction is solid. I am sure this will give him years of entertainment. This is not a toy - a great addition to your mouth harp collection."
1280,736,4.0,"I'm a guitarist with a passion for blues, so it was only a matter of time before I was going to pick up the harmonica.  I almost went with some of the cheaper options, but I am extremely pleased with my decision.  It sounds gorgeous (very full and clear), and I've already been able to start bending some notes--which I understand I notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas.As a blues guitarist I was tempted to buy a harmonica in D or A that, when played in second-position, would allow me to play along with blues songs in A or E (two of the most common blues keys; especially among the songs I like to play).  The second-position for the harp in C is G (not terribly common).  However, I think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in C, since many of the beginner songs are in C, and the C major scale should be very familiar to most musicians.  In other words, as I'm exploring the notes, they make a lot of sense to me.  At this price, I won't mind buying a D or A when the time comes--it's not like I'm already at a level where I'm dying to play those songs anyway.  And, if I need to, there are a couple of songs I've found in G (e.g., Work Song by Butterfield).  That song along should keep my practicing for a long time.  If you are still reading this review, then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp, add it to your cart."
1371,227,3.0,"This is a really cheap microphone.  I'm usually amazed how good &#34;cheap&#34; mics sound (e.g. the shure pg line is fantastic), but I'm not amazed by this mic.  It sounds like a cheap mic.  It handles high sound pressure ok, but sounds &#34;tinny&#34; and is more prone to feedback than a nicer mic.For the price, however, you should not expect any better.Likes:- Price.  This is essentially a toy.- Stand and cable too!Dislikes:- Sound quality.  Maybe you want a &#34;lo-fi&#34; sound?  You could make it work.Overall, this is a really good bargain for an extra back-up or kids mic.  It is not a horrible mic.  It is usable for applications like speaking.  For hi-fi music recording, however, you'll notice it is a cheap mic."
57,227,4.0,"Good quality for the price, It's a mic on a stand. Plug it into an amp, computer sound card, karaoke machine, whatever, and belt out your favorite tune. Is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet? No, my friend. It is not. Sorry. But it is perfectly adequate for most purposes. The stand that comes with is light and I wouldn't subject it to too much abuse (don't invite Iggy Pop over, he's rough on mic stands) but it will do the job admirably if what you want is something to hold the mic while you wave your hands in the air like you don't care. And you're gonna do that, right?"
1232,227,0.0,"Sadly, I can't review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive.  I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work, and I got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all.  And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.  I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.Still... I can't recommend this product."
1161,227,3.0,"I feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing. It works great thank you, Nady and Amazon. It's compact and great to use."
804,227,4.0,"My son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand. It comes with a cord that has a standard 1/4 inch end. I plugged it into a small guitar amp. They use it mainly to sing along with their cds/mp3's. Note that this is not really a mic I would use in my studio - it is more of a toy to be honest, but a quality toy for a young child. In that regard I give it five stars."
425,227,4.0,The mic has loud voice in my Karaoke. The stand makes my setting professional. You feel different when there is a stand holding the mic.
826,227,3.0,"This low cost, compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements.  I connect it to my portable 20 watt amp and provides the sound I need in intimate settings.  The stand is surprisingly stable and good quality."
588,227,3.0,This is not a great quality microphone. But that's not what I was expecting when I paid $25 for the mic and stand. I bought this for my group of kids in a worship school. I need some less expensive equipment to 'play on'. So it works well for that.
614,625,4.0,"Having 250 feet of xlr - xlr (m-f) cables that can be used any way I want (e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo, 1 250 foot for mono, or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work) is very flexible.The packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord (white) to store them when not in use.As all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors, this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job.  I ended up using all 10 of the 25' cords for mics and amplified speakers, plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect.  You can never have enough xlr cables or adapters!"
956,625,3.0,These aren't the dirt-cheap - these actually have some nicer connectors - mid-grade level. They aren't the cheap type with a rubber boot that pretends to be a strain-relief - these are screw on plastic bits with a more sturdy housing. Decent cables and aren't too expensive. Will buy again...
579,625,4.0,"GLS Audio 25ft Mic Cable is very High Quality. You will not be disappointed. Low cost, long lasting. I'm very satisfied."
302,625,4.0,I've used these at every gig I have run sound at for 2 months and so far they have passed the test with flying colors. They allow me to concentrate on other more important things than the reliability of my cables.
123,625,4.0,"I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events. For the price point I was worried about buying ""cheap cables"". This are a great value for your buck. The only thing I didn't like about these... the cable ties suck! haha... If you need some quality ""cheap"" cable, these are for you!"
1006,237,4.0,"Second time buying the 6 pack - great deal for the price. I love having the colored cables makes set up so easy. I also like the XLR connectors on these, haven't had one go bad yet."
267,237,4.0,"These cables are very good quality. I like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage. They are good quality, and very durable."
564,237,4.0,These cables are great in microphone or DI-box applications.  They are clean of any electrical noise.  Having color coded cables are also good too.
422,237,4.0,"very durable and flexible if you are looking for something nice and ""strong"" get this cables."
516,237,4.0,"For me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great value.It's the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place. The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. However, it's the attention to small construction details that I love. The XLR ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly.Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.Of course the color coding is a godsend. I can now tell at a glance what is connected to what, both live and in my home studio. I have not experienced any extraneous noise using these, but I am careful to eliminate sources or route around them. Still, these are as good as any other cables I have purchased.I'll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision. I was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk. Not the case. I can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for."
293,237,4.0,"I own a JamHub Greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space. This cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the JamHub colour coding system!The cables are of a pretty good quality, with solid connectors and well constructed. The cable itself is a bit 'rubbery' and not 'slinky' like some of the higher grade microphone cables, but so far they have held up fine. The cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier."
1335,237,4.0,"What more can I say? GLS makes a great product for musicians on a budget! These cables are solidly made, affordable, and really easy to differentiate on a mixer. I have become a fan of GLS!"
1352,237,4.0,"We have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices. Sounds great, looks great, the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight. Even fixed another bands vox mic connector, his sure cable was loose in the connector, this cable was tight. Has worked on...SM57, Nady Starpower, AKG 5800s, MXL 990, Marshall and Mark bass amps, and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the XLR's and on the numerous mixers. And yes COLOR RULES!"
854,237,4.0,"These cables have been solid; we use them in the studio every single day, and have held up so well compared to many others I've ordered for less.Yes, $70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money, but don't be fooled: nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable. Not only do these hold up and sound great, I've found that when working with a complicated studio setup, I'm always surprised how helpful the color-coding actually ends up being. For the price, this is totally worth it.I use these with the following to really color code my studio setup:Color windscreens:GLS Audio Mic Windscreens MicrophoneColor electrical tape:B004ZZVHGWColor patch cables:B003VYBNHGDefinitely worth it! Makes a huge difference!"
1415,237,4.0,"Picked up this set of cords for a gig I had at a large hotel event.  There were 3 audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages.  We had 48 channels  running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board, the video mix board, and then the house mix board. I had returns A-E for my subwoofer, 3 monitor mixes and a stereo main mix.  I used a different color cable for each function. I had a second set for DI boxes to the guitars, bass and keyboards.  All of the cables worked perfectly! The video mix guy asked me where I got the cables from so he could get a set for himself. These cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear down.Already had 2 sets, so I ordered one more set for my studio, so I can find connections that much easier!Great set of cables!"
288,237,4.0,"I can't believe I never thought of buying colored cables before. I often move all my microphones from one drum set to another depending on what I'm recording and now I don't have to use masking tape and write what each microphone is for, I can just look at the color and I'm all set."
1324,237,4.0,"I've purchased a couple of of the blue 25 foot mic cords from this seller before - same as these.  I've had them for well over a year used in live music at least 5 times a month.  They've been stepped on, and treated pretty rough.  They are still supple and easy to wind up.  In contrast; I have other mic cords from a different manufacturer and the set screws have fallen out, they are stiffer and just haven't held up as well.  Having the multicolor cords makes it a lot easier to see which channel on the mixer is connected to which mic.  Very inexpensive yet reliable cord.  Highly recommended."
918,123,4.0,"This mic is strong, reliable and produces the sound I'm looking for.  I used to buy all Shure products,,I'm switching to GLS..they are just great!"
905,123,4.0,"I wouldn't consider this a $30 backup mic, I would consider this a professional vocal mic.  Period.  This is a great mic!  Out of the box, it has a nice weight to it.  It sounds slightly hotter than say, a Shure SM58; which is why I like it so much.  I typically like to stand back from a mic when I sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique.  I have also tested this mic with harmonica as well.  Seriously... I don't work for the company or have any ties whatsoever.  I'm just a dude in a band.  Trust me on this one."
1087,123,4.0,Yes this ie every bit as good as the Shure SM 58 but you don't get the cool pouch. The 57 version is also like its Shure counterpart. Great sound and great deal. (yes I am a musician too)
1168,123,4.0,I bought this because it was cheap and figured it can't be that bad. I was surprised that it was good. I had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldn't tell the difference.
1368,221,3.0,"Ha, Amazon rejected my first review because I mentioned a competitor by name (chickens). Let's just say that the price is excellent, much better than the competition, and the cables work great.  How's that?"
1087,221,4.0,"I am a pro drummer and run pro sound support PA systems for outside venues as well from time to time. It is essential that I have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds. These 50 ft xlr cables are made well, I hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths. And as usual dealing with GLS and Orange County, they came fast packed well and safe. I am a continuing returning customer because of quality, price and service. And though on this particular order I had no need to contact them, they checked in with me to make sure everything went well. Great folks to deal with."
302,221,4.0,"I have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter. Most stages in bars, clubs and restaurants are small enough to use 25' mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake, but not all. These GLS Audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the 2 months that I have been using them on an almost daily basis. I have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon."
1335,221,4.0,These are great xlr cables. We run them form our board to our mains and they are excellent! I have several gls cables and have zero complaints.
942,71,2.0,I had high hopes for this replacing my pedal board but there are a couple of things I don't like about it.  It has a button clip on the back which is non-removable so makes it all but useless if you don't put it on your belt.  I don't know about you but wearing something on my belt with two 1/4 inch cables is quite a feat.  Add to that possible lines for headphones and an a/c adapter and you look like OctoMan.And what possible function does the kidney bean shape make other than making it odd to put down anywhere with the belt clip sticking out.  The menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad.  The main rotaries on the front have two functions depending whether you are holding another key down to access the second set.  This is extremely difficult to do if you need to switch between settings in a live environment.  I have had multiple mistakes and frustrations.IMHO the POD really belongs on a desktop for DAW recording.  It doesn't have much value on your belt clip.  Still have my effects rack.
536,71,2.0,"I scored a virtually unused pre-owned unit for $50.  It is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features, but simple plug and play operation is possible.  My original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my PC.  My only gripe- and it is considerable - is that the unit sounds too digital to me- particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade.  I probably would have loved this thing when I started playing (more years ago than I care to admit).  I prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals.  Does that make me a 'gear snob'?  Not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days ;)  I've also owned a Tech 21 Trademark 60 analog modeling amp (not bad but traded) and still have a Tech 21 TRI AC analog preamp(great pedal and a keeper)- both are 'modelers' and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers.  I just prefer analog all the way around.  I eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar.  He likes it fine-  I gave 3 stars because it's a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors."
1126,71,1.0,"The Good:This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.The Bad:The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise.  The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied.  The effects are hit and miss as well.  Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones."
950,71,4.0,"I had a Line 6 POD that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that. I considered a few different brands and even other Line 6 POD models. I even ordered a POD XT only to cancel that order when I realized that you can download tones from the Line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval.As many have said, the batteries that come with it did not last long at all, but that was kind of expected. I have since been using Energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs, plus I have a 9 volt AC adapter that works great, especially when I am recording.To use it for recording, simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you'll be able to record with all the tones you could want! I downloaded a Joe Satriani sound and am so happy with it that I have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great!I am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason, but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then, it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough, but I found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to &#34;grip&#34; better and stay put so that it doesn't slide right off.I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with. I don't play live so I cannot say how well it would work for that."
615,71,3.0,"I wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features.  Though it's not perfect, it's like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps.PROS:  32 amp models, 16 cabinet models, effects + thousands of available presets = TONES GALORE; good software for managing tones and creating new ones; can be used in front of an amp (in case you want to know how a modeled Mesa/Boogie would sound coming out of a real Vox); lots of connectivity; compact enough that I keep the unit, the cable and the power supply in my case; no tech problems at all; built-in noise gate and tuner; easy-to-use tap feature.CONS:  There's a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models; manual is a pdf file; hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit (though you can rename and re-arrange them with the software); presets based on famous songs don't always sound right; minor background hum; uses 4 AAA's in a few hours and the manual says don't use rechargables (though it doesn't say why); for legal reasons, the unit uses generic amp names (check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they're based on); with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy; doesn't sound as nice as a good pedal and a Marshall half stack (no kidding, right?  And I still don't sound like Alvin Lee).As an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp, this thing is cool.  You won't get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it.  Master some of the amp/cab models and how to tweak them for gain, reverb, delay, etc. before you dive into the presets.  And once you've got the presets you like best, use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily.The Line 6 Pocket Pod Pack includes a patch cord, power supply, USB cable, CD, cheap ear buds, and MP3 player cable.  The Pack is 150 new, so if you're going to buy the power supply then just get the Pack.  If you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it's like new again."
227,810,4.0,"I've been using a One Spot to power a Gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now.  In that time I've done probably over 200 gigs and I've never had a problem.  Is it super quiet?  No, but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups, there will be noise.  It's a fact of life.  I've never found it to be excessive.  Turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you're not playing.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard."
616,810,4.0,"What an amazing product. Multi-voltage capability for worldwide use, powering eight pedals, and very cost effective, too. If I bought eight adapters, it would cost me well over $120 USD. Even at the price it's sold at, the build quality is pro level. I'd be happy using this on a well-traveled pedalboard. At this price, you could buy two or three of these packs to power huge boards.I usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session. Not all at once, but it's nice to know that the delivery is smooth, without any drops or spikes in power level. I can crank 'em all if I want to, and go NUTS."
353,810,4.0,"I use this to power a Big Muff Pi, mxr compresser, Ibanez Tube Screamer, and a Planet Waves tuner pedal. The only pedal I have that it won't power is a digitech whammy, but that was expected when I bought it.  It works great. I use the 9-volt battery adapter to power the Big Muff and it even works perfect. I get no extra hum with the 4 pedals and it only takes up one spot in my surge protector. Great little power source. I'm not sure I'd use it for professional gigs, but great for home use."
658,810,4.0,"One Spot has become the standard. It is not cheap, but it is well made and useful. With this, you get the power adapter, the extension cable (to hook up multiple stomp boxes), and a bag full of converter cables. The power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet.So far, I have used it successfully only to power two pedals, so I cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board. But I am sure it would do so without issue as I have seen other do it without a complaint."
703,810,4.0,"So I recently purchased the Visual Sound One Spot Combo pack and I must say I am quite pleased. I was checking out some of the higher end products (T-Rex Fuel Tank, Voodoo Lab Pedal Power) and just didn't feel like forking over the money. Maybe one day if I'm going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around $200 I'll go for one of the other products, but from what I read on the Visual One power supply I was willing to take a risk (especially for the great price)Currently I'm powering 4 Hardwire pedals, a Dunlop Wah pedal and the Berhinger CS400 (see, I'm cheap sometimes - but effectively so) So I'm already using 6 of the 8 power supply cables. All pedals are powered without issue, without noise, there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect WHATSOEVER! I can't say enough how excited I was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board I just put together, and when it came through and worked flawlessly, it was all the better. I would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals, or even a moderate or novice player - It's simply a RELIABLE and affordable way to power your pedal board. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!Rock on"
195,810,4.0,"This is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. Using just one wall wart you can power all of them, at least those that receive this kind of power 9v. Where it went above and beyond duty was providing a L6 converter 'CL6' for Line 6 products. I have an M-Audio Black Box which had a peculiar size plug. It was 9V 1000ma but nothing would fit. Then I tried the L6 converter and bingo I'm in business and Black Box bliss. I would recommend having it around just for that. It costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can't find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters. A pedal junkies salvation."
388,810,2.0,"I like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for, and it works well for most of my Ibanez, MXR and Boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket.  It doesn't seem to work so well with my Vox wah, my old MXR Distortion Plus and my Fulltone pedals. I'm using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my Dist+, and I get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah (not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain) and intermittant operating problems with the Dist+.  I get a slightly louder hum from the Fulltone pedals when they're on, but my newer Boss/Ibanez/MXR pedals have no issues at all.  The One Spot is not a regulated power supply (if it was, they'd say so), so maybe that's the culprit; not sure."
15,810,4.0,"Bought this to power all my stomp boxes, wha peddle, tuner etc.  Works just fine.  In fact, bought a 2nd one that stays on my workbench for powering various items being tested or worked on.  Has all the adapters I needed."
485,810,4.0,Easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip. Recommended.  Well worth the price of the product.
1184,810,4.0,This thing is awesome. It doesn't take up a lot of room and has a tone of options for connections....and it's way cheaper than a power box
680,810,4.0,"If you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list  With the price of 9volt batteries you can't afford not to purchase this rig.  If you need it, there's enough wiring to have space between your pedals. But the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board.  A great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the 9volt adapter  The 9volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position."
1037,810,4.0,"I bought a pedal board and needed power and wires.  Bought this kit.  It is just super.  The 'One Spot' provides the power needed, the wiring is just right for the pedals I've installed.  This is a great set,....all you'll need to get your pedal train wired and running."
28,810,4.0,I' don't get any hum and it powers what I need it to. A much cheaper route than a DC Brick or a Pedal Power.
1066,810,3.0,"On the plus side it does the job, powers your 9V pedals and doesn't break the bank...on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into. Neon lighting can raise Hell with this power supply...but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy? Best to have a noise gate handy...just in case."
269,810,4.0,"Works like a champ.  I only have four pedals on it thus far, but I haven'te had any problems.  No noise issue, no ""brown outs"" because the power supply couldn't handle the load.  I still have open leads for those other pedals...(smile).  My power strip now has more space for other ""toys"" to make my weak playing sound better."
1369,810,4.0,I'd read a lot about the One Spot power system.  I needed 220V power overseas and so I ordered this.  It is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet.  I currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards...I may swamp them out fo this one.  Highly Recommend it.
403,810,4.0,"Love it. makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy. Quiet power supply, lots of cables and end caps and adapters, for what you'd pay for a single power adapter. It's nice not having to  dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play. About the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters, but I'm sure you can find them somewhere.good quality, and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply."
389,810,4.0,"Quite a few people are complaining about the buzz caused/induced by this.  I'm not getting any.  I use an old Arion Stage Tuner, a Digitech Bad Monkey and CM-2 Tube Overdrive, a Dunlap Wah from the 90s, and a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.  I run it all into a Fender Deville 410, which additionally runs into an Acoustic B115 Neo bass cab for extra mmmph.At first I thought it was the noise suppressor.  But even when it's off, I'm getting absolutely no buzz from my effects.For the price this is AMAZING.  To be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend.  The cables are VERY long, maybe too long, if that's possible.  If you're even thinking about buying this, JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!!!"
116,810,4.0,"I love this product.  this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings.  No need for expensive large pedalboard power adapters.  For a modest rig, or on the road use, I recommend this product."
1305,810,4.0,"great useful product well made quite, and lots of use to view of my floor effects , works great ,, and no other noise from it , buy it ."
29,810,4.0,This is now powering my entire effects board and it's doing a great job! It easily connects to a variety of different pedals with the adapters included and there's just enough wire to power everything without cluttering anything up with nests of extra wires. The value is excellent for anyone on a budget or who is tired of full power strips cluttering up their setup. I'd recommend this to any musician who uses multiple effects/instrument devices
331,810,4.0,"I bought this power supply for in home use - I don't do too much gigging or recording, so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around. The product works very well; I'm able to power 5 of my pedals easily. The cords are plenty long in length, however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other (i.e. having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal). However, that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product. I haven't had to use any of the special adapters though, but I plan on getting a Line 6 DL-4, so having the Line 6 adapter is a great added touch. Best of all, all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home. I've been using this product for months now and have no complaints. You can't beat the price."
200,810,3.0,"This system works good. I use it every gig now, no problems. The leads are actually a little too long, but that's a good thing."
1390,810,4.0,This is great for keeping your pedal board more organized. All you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in.
1331,810,3.0,"Versus the Godlyke, I'd say this is the better purchase. Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power (2amps), this is slighlty less at 1.7mA (1700mA or 1.7amps). Anyway, if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board, you may want to re-consider what you are using. The product itself is plastic, but seems solid, I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem. Being plastic though, you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over, etc. I do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the Godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into '1 spot' as advertised. The heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival. The extender that comes with is good, seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get. I only wish it came with two of them. I am using a Pedaltrain Pro board and at 32.9 inches, it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals. The combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 1/8"" power connections, some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power. One thing I have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply. A lot of companies think that if their voltage is 'close' to 9 volts, thats good enough. The reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product. You will find some higher end devices specifically warn NOT to use anything higher than 9 volts so 9.6 volts isn't 'close enough'. Anyway, while I have not checked the output of the adapter yet, I did fire it up on all the pedals I could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet. It is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other 'noise' from your signal chain. I'd buy this again and in fact I may buy another just as a back up. It is a tad pricey at thirty bucks... feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but, all in all, a good buy over the competition."
858,810,1.0,It's a good ideal but the big problem I have is if Ya are using a tube Amp. ( have a 65' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one HELL of a HUM. It's so bad I just can't use it at all. I'm not sure about a transistor Amp. but who uses those ????
777,810,4.0,"Sometime round 1994, my friend Kendal built several of these for our band. They were great and incredibly handy. I havent investigated this, but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not. Certainly, if he did, he never patented it or anything.Anyway, flash forward 18 years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes, resenting batteries and individual power supplies. I thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again....and so i did. This one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters. So far, it has lived up to my expectations. I cat speak to playing out with this yet, as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio, but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose. So, for such a simple device, you really cant beat it...unless you dont really use boxes. Personally, i presently have my wah, distortion, chorus, overdrive, delay, slap echo, and flanger running through it. Everything works great.Enjoy!"
1245,810,4.0,A real money saver a very smart buy ! It works perfect with my Boss pedals! I am very Happy!
1063,810,4.0,"This is perfect. No buzzes, no hums, no nonsense. It's just a simple to use universal power supply for pedals. Save yourself hundreds of dollars and get this. I'm so glad my friend introduced me to this product!"
947,810,4.0,"I was new to pedal effects, new to pedal boards, and new to the challenge of how to power it all.  I did my research and settled on Pedal Train for the board (the Mini, with case) and the One Spot for power.  This bundle--including an 8-pedal chain, a few adapters and the power supply--does it all.  In fact, it may be overkill.  I only have 5 pedals, so I have to hide/secure the rest of the chain with twist ties.  And the adapters, never used 'em.  But it is a complete kit.  If you need more than this, I don't know what to tell ya."
247,810,4.0,"I once dreamed of something like this around 1979 when Guitar Player magazine had a plan to build such a thing. It has 9 volt battery adapaters so that if you have a few MXR pedals from 1979, they will work on this setup. for those who have 9 volt power adapters of the more modern kind, they fit these, too. I got all sorts of stuff plugged in; mini amp, flanger (has AC), equalizer, compressor, fuzz, wah. Love my gizmos. Say good bye to batteries. This is very affordable, too, given the high number of effects it will supply. I could find nothing better on the market for the price and features."
638,810,4.0,"The One spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain.  Everything needed came with the combo, making it ready to go right out of the box."
1158,810,4.0,I have this hooked up to 4 Pedals so far and it's awesome. Real cost saver on batteries. You really cant go wrong for the price.
974,810,4.0,"What makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to 8 pedals.  It comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using! Powers pedals that have negative tip -like boss, maxon, ibanez, etc, etc.  Even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal!  Also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip!!!One of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don't stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks...takes up less room on your pedal board.  Also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables.The other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss..it can put out up to 1700mA...which is how it can run up to 8 pedals.A great item at a great price. No brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more."
294,810,3.0,"It does what it says it will, but it's still not a great pedalboard solution. The distance between the plugs is sometimes too short. Also, if you're not using ALL  the plugs, you've got a dangling end you've got to try and stash or tie off. Again it's a good item for what it does but it has inherent problems if you're pedalboard has varying distances between pedals."
1119,810,2.0,"Getting a proper pedal power unit (like Voodoo labs, DC brick, Ciok) is recommended. Even though this has a lot of outlets, each pedal may not receive enough power. I usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok. Any more than that, and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals. May not power some pedals that have a high current draw."
897,810,4.0,Does what it says. I have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them. Much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries.
345,95,3.0,"I play steel guitar and add effects to the song and different ones to my solos. I'm always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs. This is easily adjustable, and adds a depth and a near-Leslie sound. I use it often and it adds an interesting sound not possible with other effects. It's easy to use in combination with, for instance, a Chorus, or a Tremolo, for dynamic steel guitar sounds."
28,95,3.0,I have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time. I have bought $150 pedals and $100 pedals and I got this one for $25 and it blows all the others out of the water. The only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the Behringer power supply. I couldn't get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my Pyle-Pro PPDLP02 DC supply. The plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that I love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in Michigan.
759,95,4.0,"I've been wanting a pitch vibrato pedal for a while but didn't want to spend $350-$500 for an old boss vb-2(which this pedal sounds exactly like) so i looked at this which I didn't really know what to expect but when I got it I was amazed by it, it sounds really good. It maybe less durable than a metal pedal but who cares for this price I wouldn't mind buying a new one if mine broke and considering there is hardly any companies that actually make pitch vibrato's(uni-vibe/Vibe pedals are not pitch vibrato pedals)buying a new one isn't a problem."
197,95,4.0,"SUMMARYGreat pedal, buy it, you'll probably keep it! At its price point - 5 stars. I am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard. Only time will tell but I like adding some vibrato for clean sounds. It reminds me a lot of how I used to set up my Super Reverb amp. Compared to all pedals, I'd actually give it 4 stars - downgrading 1 star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the Rise control. But I liked it so much I decided to score it ""at its price point"".PROS- dirt cheap at $25 for a new pedal- sounds great - does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise (I wish I could say the same for some $200 pedals I've tried.)- Latched/Unlatched mode -- the best feature on the pedal. I love that I can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts.- Small form factor - normal ""single pedal"" size- Standard power supply - 9V Center negative - runs from pedal board power or a battery- The larger foot pedal surface (compared to just a silver bullet switch) is nice for the unlatched mode useCONS- Cheap plastic case - I doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case.- Latched/unlatched switch is small (hard to reach, have to bend over, can't do with a toe)- Rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound. Probably not needed on this pedal. Two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability.- Like most pedals - the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe, and the settings are hard to see. My favorite pedals have large knobs, well marked settings you can see from a distance, enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another, and in the best cases, enough space, size, and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump.Suggested Redesign, ""Super Vibrato"" or ""Vibrato II""1) Change to a metal case2) Lose the Rise control altogether3) put the latched/unlatched modes on a 2nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes4) Increase the size of and space between the other two controls -- put large ""foot controllable"" knobs with high visibility knobs.Then again, at 25 bucks, I might just buy a 2nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode."
1361,95,0.0,"DOA...no good, out of the box,plug it, nothing.....no way to send it back (I`m not from the States)....meaning...I just wasted away $40 something bucks (add shipping)....I did bought a Behringer pedal before (Tremolo/Pan) with good results, but I guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals....Well, I`ll man up and buy something else..."
1305,95,4.0,"this pedal is well made plastic but w great electronics made designed by german mind.. it sounds like a chorus and vibrate at once,, wave tone and quiet,, w true bypass on bord.. great pedal for the money,, get it . its worth it. for guitar bass or keys."
304,336,4.0,I recommend itthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityI like the sound it is very goodthank you for this product
432,336,2.0,"behringer may be cheap, but they do create some good products, for this one it's a hit and miss. although i ordered three of them."
922,336,4.0,"This should be your first pedal. For 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion. No other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck. It's clean, High Fidelity, and versatile as a swiss army knife."
1145,336,3.0,"I got this because at just around 32 bucks, its pretty much seemed like a stealcompared to other pedals I was looking at.But a few notes..If you buy this, definitely have/buy a 9v adapter with a (-) polarity.Also know that when people said that little blue light was blinding, well,they weren't kidding. I've put a little paper and tape over mine as well, however it isn't sticking.It might not have the best effects or effect strength, but as my amp has no built in effects, its better than nothing.If you're cheap like me but want effects, this is decent, although the chorus effect seems particularly weak."
1030,330,4.0,"i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great, for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal.behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality.thank u guys."
845,330,4.0,I have other Behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them.  I use a power snake instead of batteries so I cannot comment on battery life or compartment access.  The box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence.
52,330,2.0,"I ordered this pedal based on the previous review, but to me it sounds cheap and faint. I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping. To me, it wasn't even close to as good as what you get on Fender amps or on my TC Electronics Delay pedal (which includes chorus/vibrato), and I thought that I would go solo with this pedal, but for me it's a no go..."
1319,330,4.0,I wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since I have mostly Behringer products (and am more than satisfied with my other pedals) decided to try the CO400. Again I am more than satisfied. A chorus isn't something you use all the time so I expect this one to give me years of good Behringer reliability and service. For someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal.I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can't beat the price. A great value for your money.
150,446,4.0,"I am a beginner guitar player. I have a Yamaha F335BL and a Hohner HC06.  I bought the Yamaha a few years back, and just recently started to really learning to play it.  It sounds ok, but not great (though the Price is pretty good for it)  It is all laminated, and the action is pretty high.Looking online I saw that people really liked the Seagull S6 Original for its sound and price point. Boy were they right. I got this guitar from Guitar Center (after I tried it out)  The action is low, and the fretboard is bigger (for fingerstyle and beginners this is really good).  The sound is also REALLY good, its very resonant, and just sounds &#34;good&#34;.  It is hard to describe the sound, you woul dhave to hear it.I did replace the pins with Presentation Tusq Pins, I could not really tell a difference in sound, but it did make it look nicer.Highly recommend this and other guitars from Seagull (try the Merlin, its fun)"
317,446,4.0,"I've been playing for about 17 years.  Most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in Columbus, Ga.  My performance guitar is a Martin HD-28 and my practice guitar is a Blueridge BR-180.I wanted a third guitar just for kicks.  I'd been looking a Taylors, but didn't want to spend that much money.Enter the Seagull S6.  A fellow picker asked if I'd ever heard of a Seagull - I hadn't - he said they were nice guitars and I ought to check them out.  So, I did a little research.  I first read all the nice reviews here for the S6 and then went on YouTube and listened to a few.  My guitar is a Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 and I really like it. I choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft, and I understand that the spruce has more volume. I got the S6 today and this evening my wife, with her Taylor GS Mini, and I, with this S6, played Smokey Mountain Memories.  Nice, real nice guitar.I found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box.  I'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, I'll let him.  I'm also going to put on some Elixir Light strings.  I don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box.But, the bottom line is that I am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right out of the box.  I'm glad I bought it."
1055,446,4.0,"This is my first time buying a guitar without testing it first.I have no regrets.All of the positive reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent guitar model are spot on.If you're in the market, and don't have a grand to spend on a new acoustic guitar, get this North American made gem.You won't regret it."
372,446,4.0,"Seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website, but there is no dealer anywhere near me, so I bought one sight-unseen from Amazon, based on the good reviews. I'm glad to say I can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design.A traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction.  The narrow, reverse-taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom-heavy look when viewed vertically. Back and sides are cherry with only a light stain, and the binding is dark. The top is natural cedar.As dreadnoughts go, this one is very comfortable to play sitting down. It appears to be based on the Martin outline, but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout. Weight is pleasantly light, and the semi-gloss finish is comfortable to the touch. Players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard, but those with small hands should consider the """"Slim"" version, with a neck 0.08"" narrower at the nut.Sound is what really counts, however, and this Canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there. The maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high-quality, fresh strings, allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up. Overall, it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category, with good volume.Buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer. Both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering, and the truss rod required adjustment (a long-reach hex wrench is included). If you are not experienced in these tasks, a local luthier should do it for no more than $30 or so.Based on sound, playability once adjusted, and construction quality, this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range. It is a real standout in value.Update 8 DEC 2012: The more I play this guitar, the more I love it. It delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought ""snap"", and once the action was dialed in, the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding I didn't fully realize hindered my playing. I am considerng replacing my Takamine mini-jumbo with a Seagull equivalent."
242,446,4.0,"Although not through Amazon.com, I recently purchased a Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar. I compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range, as well as with the Seagull Entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range.  The S6 has a nicely consistent tone which, although maybe a little too bright for some players' tastes, projects very well.  Some reviewers and guitarists with whom I've talked wonder how Seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in North America for the price.  I think that I found part of the answer when I looked inside some of the Seagulls.  The braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars.  Looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it, though, you'd never know.  I find the 1.8"" neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering.  It's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width.  For me, it works.  Some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar.  Seagull does offer other models, by the way, that have a more traditional width.  The slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale Gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models:  just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering, but not so short as to cause floppy strings.  I couldn't be happier with the Seagull S6, especially for the price!"
871,446,1.0,"I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews. I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull to me is over-hyped.Thanks for reading!"
1201,446,2.0,"I personally think this Seagull is over rated. A lot of reviewers are covering the muddy (not crisp) sound as &#34;mellow&#34;I don't think so.  I have over 115 guitars in my collection, and around 15 of them are acoustics.I have nothing against Seagull, or Canada, but bought one of these NEW off the rave reviews, and just recently (I have had both theS6 and FGX730 for five years) pulled the S6 out for another try just because I could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used Yamaha; IT DID!Side by side I went through the chords on each guitar, and had to finally come to the conclusion that the Seagull had to go.With a price tag of $420.00 for the S6, and $282.00 for it's Yamaha equal, the FG730S, unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away, I would stay away from this guitar, and look elsewhere.Oh, by the way, I have an S6 for sale!"
1311,446,4.0,"I bought this guitar in 2005.  It sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way.  I think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value.This model has the cedar top.  I love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars.  It is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that.  If you prefer the bright concert sound of a Martin then you'll not want this cedar top.Yes this guitar has an oiled finish.  This allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded.  It also allows you to knock the heck out of it.  Funny thing is that after five years there isn't much damage just a little arm wear.  I think you'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around.The neck feels silky smooth.  The frets are well placed and don't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you'll get in other guitars in this price range.  Paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing.This doesn't come with a case so I bought a hard shell by the brand name ""Canadian"".  Great case.When I bought it it really didn't need an adjustment but I took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me.  I've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished.  I also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in Chicago.  Performing these tasks will prolong the life of your Seagull and your enjoyment of it.--------------------Update: 10/13/2012 update of my 2010 review.  This guitar sounds even BETTER.  I went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic ""just for fun"" and I had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket.  To my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior.  You see I learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will ""open up"" and keep sounding better.  Yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of.  It will increase in value (to you at least)."
382,89,4.0,"I take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile, but it always finds its way back in.  Unlike Kaga, I put it at the end of my chain, right before a Boss Line selector, for multiple amps.  I used to put it at the beginning of my chaing, during my metal days, and it does well there too.  I'm more blues orientated now, and love it at the end.  With my fuzzes I can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth, then at the end with the EQ, I got it jacked up!  Unlike most people I love a bass players V on my EQ.  I love that bass, but I play through 10's and 15's and those speakers handle it better than 12's, although I do have a 2x12 with V30's in it and it sounds nice.  This is a must have pedal though, no matter what you want your sound to end up like, if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone, you got it with this thing."
352,89,3.0,"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: If you play an Orange, Vox, or Marshall, you don't necessarily *need* an EQ pedal, but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level.Why is this? Well, the Brits design their amps with wide and musical EQ but the overall frequency response is narrow. This has led many British amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that British EQ isn't as dramatic as American guitarists want it to be. There is nothing wrong with this by any means - it's just an overall characteristic of British amplifiers.Secondly, any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel - since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly. This pedal is more than capable of providing that boost. +15dB seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty, or dirty to overdrive, or overdrive to distortion.LIVE PERFORMANCE: If you're in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs, you've probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass/midrange noise (100~500Hz) that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter. Applying EQ to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low-end from the picture and boosting your high-end for better clarity.RECORDING DIRECT-IN: If you're using this pedal with a DI box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping, you'll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your Strat or brighten your Les Paul.WHY 4 STARS? Yes, the noise. It's not bothersome by any means, but if you're recording with a mic'd amp or direct in, you will absolutely need a noise suppressor. I use my GE-7 with the BOSS NS-2, and the NS-2 completely removes the white noise generated from the GE-7. The result is an amazing, clean boosting EQ.IF YOU'RE ON THE FENCE... go ahead and get this thing. You won't regret it. It's not just for Tone Snobs, it can really make cheap gear sound way better, and take great gear to the next level."
675,89,4.0,This 7 band eg. is a great way to change the sound of your guitar. It has more flexability than just a tone knob. It's easy way to get scooped metal or just fine tune the sound of you amp and guitar. Highly recomended!
1157,89,4.0,"I've had this pedal since the mid-90's, when I started playing in my teens.  While an EQ might seem like an odd choice for a beginner's pedal selection, I was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap CRATE and Marshall amps I used back then.  Since I have better equipment now, I haven't used it as much.However, as simple as it is, it is definitely a useful tool.  You can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs.  Or, you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts.The only negatives I recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise (but not so much that you couldn't trap it with a noise gate), and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit.  Again, nothing that can't be fixed with other effects.  And if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment, it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well.I give it 5* despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and BOSS products are built rock solid.  I'll have this thing forever."
1326,560,3.0,"So if you want to play just in your garage this is really good for the price.I like it, it's ok, the sound is kind of a cold distortion. If you like warm sounds you should see something else."
304,560,4.0,amazing the bestI can't believe ... this pedal is the favorite oneexcellent sound good metalwithout words..I recommend it  thanks behringer
715,560,4.0,"Bought this distortion pedal for our son...who plays his electric guitar daily. He loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use. It also produces a nice &#34;distorted&#34; sound quality and tone (I don't know if I would agree, as my generation hails from a different genre of music). But he loves it and I guess that's all that matters!"
1137,560,4.0,"Very nice tone, very nice metal sound, very crunchy and deep. Well worth it for the price, on par with other way more expensive pedals. Definetly buy the power supply with it though, it just makes it better and easier to use. Very nice product overall"
36,560,4.0,It has Great sound and distorts like its suppose to.I have been needing one for A long time.Thanks Beringer USA
922,560,4.0,So many tones to choose from with the variable frequency Eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal.
8,560,3.0,Sound 95% like the boss mt-2 just not as clear as boss pedal. Sounds like it belongs to 80's trash metal didn't really do me to good with modern death or thrash metal
620,560,0.0,"It sounds very artificial, I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that I use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price I payed for it before. I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. Shitty pedal."
1048,560,4.0,"I've always liked Behringer products ,There prices are pretty reasonable and the quality cant be beat.I just ordered there blues pedal cant wait for that one !"
897,560,4.0,Don't let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you. This is an awesome pedal. Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound. It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don't abuse it to much it should be fine. You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours. As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price. Buy this!
932,797,4.0,I am well pleased with the quality and performance of these cables. I have used them with my bands PA system and they work nicely. I would and do recommend them to anyone looking for quality at an affordable price.
812,797,4.0,"I have purchased various lengths of these GLS cable to patch my rack equipment. They are well made, reliable and cost effective. The XLR connectors are secure and I couldn't purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less. The colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light."
516,797,4.0,"I use this to patch in four ports from aBBE DI-400 4 Channel Active Direct Box Direct Injection DI Boxand two from anAlesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifierinto a mixer. First, the size is perfect in my rack configuration. The cables easily reach, and the color coding makes it a snap to see at a glance what is connected to what. That is a great improvement over tags and labels that require you to get close to read.What makes these a bargain is construction. The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. However, it's the attention to small construction details that I love. The XLR ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly. Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.Overall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent set-up and teardown, and is built to last. If you are shopping for patch cables in this size these are a great value in my opinion because you will probably not have to replace them for years."
1221,865,4.0,"This came today and I must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly. My Takamine acoustic/electric fits perfectly and is VERY STABLE on the stand. I have 100% confidence this will NEVER tip over on its own. You'd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over. Anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill.This is built like a tank and should last a lifetime. It is adjustable (the neck) fully padded, and the two-arm base piece swivels for a custom fit. The stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport. A+++++++++++++"
511,865,4.0,"This OnStage ""Heavy Duty Guitar Stand"" is exactly what we were looking for to hold my son's acoustic guitar. Here are my observations:+ Easy to Setup; takes just a few seconds+ Sturdy; free standing design works well+ Neck Retainer; adds a degree of protection from accidental knocksThis is a great basic stand that works exactly like we hoped!Highly Recommended!CFH"
1117,865,4.0,Excellent value for the money although not any more heavy duty than other stands I own. Nice and stable for my classical guitar.
205,865,4.0,"This is a good stand.  I've had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before, and this one is definitely much sturdier.  It fits every guitar I've put in it just fine, and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck.  If you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something, then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up."
506,865,4.0,"Using this for a PRS electric guitar with satisfactory results.  Easy to set up. Sturdy enough for repeated use.  No worries about using this with an expensive instrument.  Simply put, it's well made and works great."
1040,865,2.0,"This stand was very inexpensive and I thought I could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my Epi Sheraton II.  Unfortunately I am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand.  It seems to be built well enough for what it is, but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards. Also, for left/right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems 'tippy'.The construction itself is 'ok'. The rubber tips on the feet seem fine, but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short.  The body cradle is nicely padded but isn't firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design, it just isn't all that solid.  You can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece.  It ships with an unsightly white UPC sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage.Granted, the Sheraton II is a large and heavy guitar but the OnStage is billed as ""Heavy Duty"" and to me that means SOLID, which this stand just isn't, at least with larger guitars or basses.  When you use a guitar stand you can't afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood.Bottom line, you get what you pay for. For smaller, lighter guitars, Strats and such, it may be ok, but for Dots, Sheratons, 335's and larger Gretch's, I just wouldn't trust it and that goes for most basses as well.I will need to look for something else."
858,865,4.0,"I have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is Great. As a matter of fact, I ordered 2 more. Get this one and have No Regrets........"
450,865,4.0,This stand was purchased to replace my older bass guitar stand - which was weak and falling apart.  I neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect.
1003,43,3.0,"I think it's good but for wiping down after playing or for buffing after wax on my classical guitar bodies, I think I prefer the old flannel cloths instead. Micro-fiber seems to be slicker and generally did not feel that it was doing the job (mostly removing finger prints etc). Maybe it needs to wear out a bit or if it had a thicker nap to it."
170,43,4.0,ordered a few of these...should come in different sizes...but for the price these are fine...keep em in every case...enjoy..will buy again
1298,43,4.0,I chose this rating because I found this product superior to other similar products I have purchased in the past.
15,43,3.0,"This is a good micro-fiber cloth, but I guess because its from Ernie Ball it costs more than other clothes.  But if you are like me, its all about my axes, I have one in each gig bag/case!  I don't recommend using with polish, just a wipe down after each guitar or bass use."
1279,43,4.0,Works great with or without polish.  It is a good size and the ziplock bag it comes in keeps the polish I use from drying out.
77,43,4.0,"It is just as described,I am happy! Amazon always comes through,without a hitch,it was delivered as usual before stated time!"
596,43,4.0,"Removes grime and such. Makes surfaces very smooth(I don't know how it works individually, I used it with Gerlitz cleaning spray). It works well with cleaning spray."
950,43,3.0,It works and it is relatively inexpensive. I keep it in the original packaging so that it stays fresher and it really makes the finish on my guitar shine like new.
1071,43,4.0,"Awesome little untreated polishing cloth. I have purchased these for all of my guitars (more than I care to admit) and they are fantastic. They clean great, removing all oil and fingerprints and they are reasonably priced. Awesome product to keep your axe looking great."
665,146,4.0,I bought these xlr cables for my mobile DJ rig and they perform flawlessly.  The contruction is of high grade material and the signal is of studio quality.  Buy with confidence.
936,146,4.0,"Good quality cables , bright colors make identification easy when hooking up to a mixer , this makes it easy to follow whats going to where , good connectors and nice flexible cable , does the job very well, with care they should hold up well , thumbs up for GLS"
423,146,4.0,"I've used GLS products before and they are good quality for a fair price. Their microphones do a great job for little cost. I've been impressed. These cables didn't disappoint me, either. Don't judge their products on price alone. Try them first. You will be pleased and your bank account will thank you."
817,146,4.0,"I am no audio file, but these do the job and I like the colors.I did buy some more expensive Magami ones and I can't tell a difference."
709,146,4.0,"*Incredible quality and value.These cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than I expected for the price.They use heavy duty wire and insulation, and are well constructed. They employ quality connectors, and have strain reliefs on each end.The dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables, and the color coding is a big plus as well.Not only is the product outstanding, but I was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure I was happy with the cable set.I am so pleased with this purchase that I am a customer for life.*"
244,146,4.0,"If you are have problems knowing what and where your systems are terminating, theses are a must for you. I have mastched them with my microphones and it is easy for controlling and identifying ."
830,430,4.0,Very happy with these cables. Just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job. Well made and look and feel sturdy.
1167,430,3.0,Its the exact same thing as my &#34;Shure&#34; mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material. thats fine by me. They fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should
864,430,4.0,XLR cables are hard to mess up...these are great. They do the trick. Why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap?
1400,430,4.0,this is a solid cable works very well form I can now walk around more with the extension no more limitations. Quality is excellent.
1078,430,4.0,I purchased these cables for my Behringer 802 mixer & MXL 770 mic and these cables are perfect! Finally get to have quality sounding tracks knowing I have the professional cables to back me up! The best XLR cables you can find. Hands down.
1349,430,4.0,These cable are perfect!!  I've bought much more expensive cable that didn't have the quality of these.  They even had velcro (re-useable tape to hold them 2 each).
1371,549,4.0,These balanced patch cables are great.  This is the third set of various music cables I've purchased from this brand and they are all great quality for the price.  Love their XLR microphone cables too.
900,549,4.0,"Ok, 6 TRS patch cables, 6' long each for $30.00? I was skeptical when I purchased these, but I'm happy that I did and will soon be ordering at least 6 more.  Absolutely no noise from my mixer to my stand-alone recorder or to my computer-based interface.Excellent value.Update:  I just received another set of these cables.  I'm extremely happy with the build quality and performance.  I'll be looking at additional items from this company."
312,549,3.0,"I recently bought these for my home studio, so far so good, keyboards to mixer. They are a little flimsy, but so far no problems, have extras if necessary, high end cables also break down. They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus. For the price and selection and results, works for me."
1325,549,4.0,The title says it all.  There is literally no better deal on the net for the quality you receive!  I've been using my cables very happily for 2 months now with no problems!  If you're looking for some good TRS cables....look no further!!
670,549,4.0,"I bought the TS version of these cables, and they have served me well, These are of the same quality, and a great value for the price."
255,549,4.0,They look nice and do the job perfectly well.  The price is not too bad.  The colours help with organization.
1176,549,4.0,"Besides that fact that they are quality cables, the colors are pretty dope and really stand out nicely in the studio."
421,621,4.0,"Holy buckets of tone batman!Let me start by saying, I'm always on the quest for great amazing tone. I think it ends here. This pedal is absolutely remarkable. Built like a tank, I'm pretty sure it will out live me. Its full of sonic options.The overdrive has a level, tone and overdrive. Almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an EQ which is a total plus in my book. it also has a mini toggle for comp cut, fm, and vintage modes. The comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end, the fm is really transparent, and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange bite.Yes, this may be another tube screamer clone, but it's a darn great one.The added MOSFET circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your low-end fattening it up, if thats your cup of tea, while the standard leaves it more transparent. You should know this switch does effect the whole signal, not just that of the boost side.On to my only negative check on this pedal, the boost ONLY works when the OD is on. It is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive, just additional circuitry to add more gain to your OD signal.Another great feature, this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v-18v.Running at standard 9v gets you easier breakup, whereas 18v will get you more headroom.This pedal won't be leaving my board, probably ever. If you're even thinking about it, just do it!!! You'll never regret it."
1018,621,4.0,So far so good with this pedal. Nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated.I mainly play relatively clean through a tube amp and use this pedal to simply cut through on the leads.I don't use this pedal for searing leads or ultra dirty sounds - just a little dirt - and two levels of it.It makes a good single channel amp act like a three channel amp and so far it is working great!Main amps - 1960 Bassman - 2012 Fender Hot Rod Deluxe - 1957 Fender Bandmaster - these amps sound great with this pedal - I don't use all three at the same time but one of these amps is with me when I play out.This pedal is very versatile and there are lots of good sounds in there so you will probably find something you like in there - but I don't think it will metal very well by itself but it would kick the front end of a good tube amp into another level of distortion pretty good.*****************************************09/27/2013Still lovin' this pedal. You gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up.This pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds - and is very versatile.I would purchase another if I needed it.Worth every penny.
83,621,4.0,"This gear is for who wants a versatile overdrive pedal. It's go from light overdrives on channel 1 to heavy drives on boost channel. With mini trim pots you can add some flavor to the sound.On the other side, you can't use boost channel without drive channel."
1364,719,4.0,Guitar bag fit over my Fender T Bucket guitar. Cheap price and does the job. It has just enough padding and heavy duty nylon to protect my acoustic from being scratched. Worth $24.
464,719,4.0,"Haven't used it yet, but it looks nice and came quicker than expected. So far so good! I recommend it."
1152,719,3.0,Very easy to get the guitar into and seems to protect the instrument very well.  Exactly as described in the ad.
1190,719,0.0,"ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home ""12/23/11"" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for."
104,719,4.0,"This bag is made well enough. If you are careful it offers good protection. You can't rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly can't stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc. If your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag, otherwise it's a good bag, especially at this price."
499,719,4.0,"I'm very happy when I got this gig bag. Good quality and Thik cussion. Good enough to travel around this world with peace of mind.Best price with free shipping! That's good enough? Finish your serch and buy this one. I highly recomended this. PS.-this gig bag cannot fit full size guitar, OK?"
647,743,4.0,Quick and accurate.  I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars.  Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though.
1326,743,2.0,"If you are like me that you love playing music, this is a good buy. It pretty much does what it's supposed to. So, you plug it and it's ready to use. It's pretty fast, and accurate for it's price. Light weight.The only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the 6th string.Overall, it's good enough to buy it."
1141,743,4.0,"Bought this in early March this year & have it in-line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board. No problems with it at all. It works as advertised. I've found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my Fender G-Dec amp so what does that tell you?Not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because I love mine. For the money you can't get one that touches it. So what if it's not $100+? That means you have more green stuff to buy other things.Since buying this one & having it work so well, I now own a couple of other Behringer pedals."
1030,743,3.0,"for musicians in a budget this is the deal, it is not the best but it still does the job.not very powerful to read the signal of strings in my acoustic guitar as it does the Boss tuner, but for electric or bass is fine.very accurate too. just gettit if u are in a budget."
1172,743,4.0,"WOW, I got more than I expected from this Chromatic Tuner, Sure it's a plastic case, but who would be rough on a pedal anyways, had it about 3 weeks now, and im impressed, I see people say the blue indicator light is too bright, but truthfully, its OK, because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough, if it is too bright for you, just put a little piece of black tape over the light, but like i said its OK cause you can still see the tuner lights, I use this pedal with theVisual Sound One Spot Combo Pack, works like a charm."
1137,743,4.0,"i had no issues with this, got it so i could tune on stage while playing without making lots of noise. works great, does exactly what it says, definetly get the power supply with it, so you never have to worry about a battery. i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times."
1220,743,3.0,"Look at this pedal.  Look at what it does, and what it costs.  $30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor, and that's if you don't even try to hunt down a lower price.  By contrast, Boss's TU-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing, and it costs $100 retail.Yes, the housing is made of plastic.  I don't know about you, but I generally won't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set.  If you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever, it should survive.  And if it doesn't, so what?  It's cheap to replace.The other person on here obviously got a faulty model, which happens.  Mine's developed a touchy input jack over time (it's actually the earlier TU-100 model), but I don't know that it's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap.  One star off for these kinds of quality control problems, just to be fair.  I own three other Behringer pedals as well, and they're still going strong.A tuner is an essential part of any musician's rig, and this does the job just fine.  Use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing.UPDATE: After having used a new tuning pedal for some time, I will admit that, yes, this is a subpar tuner.  However, I still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay, this isn't a bad investment.  For a guitarist just starting out, this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound."
1384,743,4.0,Seems great need more time to explore what it can do...
845,743,4.0,This workk well however I do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range. I may need new cables.
268,743,3.0,thing works fine... easy to understand settings ..sturdy enough.. lights nice an bright. i like it..use with power supply and not batteries..works best
239,248,3.0,"Cables are good, my only complaint is the connectors. The 1/4&#34; is not too bad at all, but the XLR end looks and feels cheap. I guess that's because they are cheap. Very good price and good performance. No wierd signal buzz like other cables in this category. Overall, 4 stars!"
888,248,3.0,It's not as nice as my Audio Technica one but this does the job and I'm happy.  A little flimsier than the AT but at the price it's good.
19,248,4.0,"Great price but very fragile.  I'm a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables.  The end separated from the cable - not very good quality, would not buy this brand again."
964,248,1.0,"In my experience these cables were not great.  The connectors rattle, they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise.  I can't expect miracles at that price-point but I certainly expected better. I avoid this brand of cables."
705,407,4.0,Love these pedals good buy
545,407,4.0,"These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like ""All Nightmare Long"" and ""Beast and the Harlot"" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em"
385,407,4.0,"I bought this for my son's 7th birthday. He badly needed an upgrade from his Ludwig Jr Kit's bass pedal. This is a great pedal for younger kids, or people learning the double bass for the first time. Seems a little slow, but, as I said, for my 7 year old it is perfect. Seems well build, but for pros or the gigging musician, you may want to save up some change and buy a better pedal. 5 stars because of the price and what I was expecting to get. I wasn't expecting pro level gear for a sub $100 pedal."
607,721,4.0,"This is, by far my favorite pedal on my pedal board, but you should know somethingi hate it at first, because i had a solid state amp, and this one sounded like crap(sorry for the bad word), then i got a tube amp, and omg, its like GOD in person.I really really recomend this one."
233,721,4.0,Excellent stomp box. You can dial it right in to get that SRV sound. Very sturdy and very well made. A must have for any blues player.
240,721,4.0,For the money this is a tremendous pedal.  The next step up might be the new MXR Bonamassa tube pedal but that is almost double the price.  By the way Bonamassa does use this pedal albeit a fairly old one ... maybe the maxon made version.  I doubt there is that much difference...  Very well made and useable and effective tone controls unlike other pedals that I find only click in at the ends of the adjustments and the middle area is modest.  It is great and I kinda like the great look.  You really have to watch the prices cause they do fluctuate a fair bit .  It has gone up more than 10 percent in just a few weeks..
803,721,4.0,"If you need a tube screamer. You can't go wrong with the TS9. The only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you. I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. It sounds amazing. It just might not be your sound. I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9. People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. They prefer it. It's not better. Both are great."
83,721,1.0,"I bought this unit for a friend, and I could compare with others overdrives I already have. I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise."
536,820,3.0,"I've owned a TS808 since I purchased it used in the 80s for around $20.  Yes, this is a great overdrive.  This pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings.  Pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup - now you're in tone heaven.  But the plain truth is this:  there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does - and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the 808 reissue.  This was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives.  I own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it's not the most transparent or versatile. There is a 'mid hump' in the EQ of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn't.  I'm glad I own mine but I don't think I'd shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue.  If I am not mistaken both the TS9 and the TS7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time.  If this pedal came in under the $100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars.  I really hate to burst anyone's bubble but SRV's tone was really in his fingers.  And so is yours ;)"
675,820,4.0,"I have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but I hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers. It really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound. This pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts. This pedal has three preamp settings: Ts9, Hot, +, and Turbo. It's great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar. One nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings. For example: if you set on the ""Turbo"" setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely. If you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound. If you want a metal sound, then I recommend the Metal Zone by Boss/Roland.BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal"
994,820,4.0,There is a reason this is the number one best selling guitar effect pedal on the market.  The Tube Screamer just works.  :-)
803,820,4.0,"If you need a tube screamer. You can't go wrong with the TS808. The only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you. I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. It sounds amazing. It just might not be your sound. I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9. People who say this is better than the TS9 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. They prefer it. It's not better. Both are great."
273,820,4.0,"To start, as the full name of this pedal would indicate, this pedal is for tube amps. I can't comment on how it'll sound for a hybrid, and my experience is that it's definitely not for solid state. Distortion pedals go much better with solid state. Further, tube screamers aren't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain; again, that's what a distortion pedal will do. Tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder,and are most commonly used as a solo boost. Tube screamers are in the category of ""overdrive"" pedals, and like the name would indicate, they're meant add a little extra ""over"" an already ""driven"" amp, but in a more natural, smooth, organic way then a distortion pedal would.HOWEVER, the Ibanez TS-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer. The extra knob that switches between ts9, +, hot, and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options. Let me expound:I play hard rock and metal through a Bugera 1990 head (basically a Marshall JCM 900)and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers. While that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap, it's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided. A standard Ibanez TS-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern, heavier tones, because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids, again, to help solos cut through the mix. But the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem. By switching to +, hot, or turbo mode, the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally. I like the ""+"" setting the best. So the way I use this pedal is that I'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high. Then, for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound, I'll kick on my ts9dx, with the drive pretty low (9 o'clock), volume at 12 o'clock, tone about 1 o'clock, and + mode. With these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone, and adds a little gain and volume. So it's basically like adding another channel to my amp.I will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you: tubescreamers in general, and certainly this Ibanez ts-9dx, add mid-range to your tone automatically. And you can't dial it out. The regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids, and a little more high mids. The other modes add more low mids in particular, which in part contribute to the overall ""thickness"" to the tone, which can be great. But if you're after a scooped mid sound, say for metal, then I would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost, where the mids will help cut through the mix.In conclusion, it's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt. And yes, this pedal will do that. So will the BBE greenscreamer, behringer tube overdrive,mxr distortion plus, Boss SD-1, digitech bad monkey, or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations. But by adding the turbo-mode options, the Ibanez TS-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players (depending on the exact style) in a way that these plethora of other options won't."
83,820,4.0,"This unit is like a old blue jeans. Problaly exist betters pedals, but it's produce the vintage overdrive that match with everything..."
22,174,4.0,"If you're not familiar with EHX's signature distortion/fuzz pedal the Big Muff, please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out.  Describing its sound with words helps, but doesn't really do it justice.  It definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you'll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand.They're one of my very favorite effects, honestly.  So for this review, I'm going to focus more on how the Little Big Muff stacks up against the other models.For starters, this version takes care of ALL of the common complaints regarding the NYC reissue.1.  Its true bypass.2.  Its much smaller (not super tiny like a Boss, but a little slimmer than, say, the wider MXR pedals like the Phase 100).3.  It uses a normal 9v adapter jack (thank you, finally!).4.  It sounds better.Yes, it indeed SOUNDS better than the NY Reissue.  Some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has.  This one is smoother.  Not as creamy as the Russians, but it also doesn't suck tone like that one does either.  Its a touch higher gain than both the Russians and the Tone Wicker versions, but all in all it absolutely is a Big Muff.So if you're in the market for one of these, and you don't want the options the Tone Wicker Muff provides, this is absolutely where its at.  Its better in every way than the NY Reissue.Also, it costs less money! Yay!"
504,174,4.0,"The Little Big Muff does one thing spectacularly well: it delivers massive fuzz-plus-sustain. For that purpose, it's excellent, both in sound and construction (it feels like a metal brick). However, be warned: if you're looking for a standard ""distortion pedal,"" this is not it. It's a fuzz pedal. It delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal (like, say, a BOSS DS-1). If a great fuzz pedal is what you want, this is a superb choice--and, so far as I know, the best one for its price. If the price is still too much for you, consider the ModTone Fuzzer, which is about as good but substantially cheaper (at least as I write this)."
1070,174,4.0,"I own several Electro-Harmonix pedals and overall I like the brand (even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his YouTube videos). Of those I own, two of them are the smaller versions of the GIGANTOR classic E-H pedals, one of them being the Little Big Muff.First of all, if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz, overdrive, and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything. These effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds, so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do. Do some research by looking on YouTube, looking at Dave Hunter's book on effects, and testing them out at a store.If you are looking for a basic fuzz box, the Little Big Muff will give you nice sound similar to (if not the same) as that of the Big Muff Pi, depending on the exact year/model you have. I think the tone is great, but as with most basic fuzz boxes, there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them. It is simple to use though, and it makes a lot of noise.As a bonus, these don't take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the Big Muff Pi, yet will give the same tone. It is great for punk, alt rock/grunge, and classic hard rock like Hendrix and Black Sabbath.I also have a germanium (red) Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini, another good small version of one of the classics, and the Fuzz Face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three (the blue silicon and aqua Hendrix models boost treble more). To quickly compare it to the Little Big Muff regarding sound, the Fuzz Face does not have a tone control, but I think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation. While the Little Big Muff will give you more control over the tone (EQ), like many EHX pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly. In this case when you begin turning the Sustain, it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone. As you increase the amount of saturation, you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same. So, I'd say while both the red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini & the Little Big Muff are good tools, each comes with its own disadvantages.Though some E-H units come with power supply, this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries. Although few pedals come with power supplies, I think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unit.If you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board, then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industrial-looking Little Big Muff. I like pretty things, but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kit.Bottom line:(1) Gives the classic Big Muff fuzz sound(2) Does not eat up pedalboard space like the old GIGANTOR models(3) Noisy (not always in a good way) when on, but has true bypass when off(4) Has tone control (EQ), but the ""Sustain"" saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control (limits dynamic control of your picking)(4) Simple to use, but limited sound palette(5) Decent price, but power supply sold separately(6) Bleak appearance (not shiny, colorful, or sparkly)"
434,854,2.0,"It's a cool pedal, especially considering it's price, but don't be fooled. All this pedal does is perform volume swells. Any other sound you are able to create with this pedal, you wouldn't JUST be using this pedal. Think of it as a supplumentary effect. If you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal, you need to use it in combination with other effects; Reverse delay, wah, distortion, etc.It's convenient too, if you are playing and you want use volume swells, but you also want to use other effects like wah, whammy, something else that requires the attention of your feet. If you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells. I would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it. Pure convenience.It has it's quirks though, If you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain. To the point where its non-existent. But the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly. If sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast, the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck... the rest will just play as if the effect was off.Other than that, its built well, doesnt add any hiss. no noticeable signal loss, other than if the sensitivity is at min. The battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure. power adapters are your friend.It's cheap, its convenient. But i wouldn't recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless... especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast... that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry. Oh that reminds me, the casing is plastic...:-/"
746,854,0.0,"It was Not what I wanted. When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use. I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer, String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings. It might be good for playing with a Bow, I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow."
616,155,3.0,"I've never really owned a fuzz pedal before, but have tried a few. Out of most I've tried, I've come across the Big Muff the most. It didn't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently. Even my Boss Hyper Metal HM-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks, but it isn't 100% there, certainly.My budget being what is it right now, I didn't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal. There are loads of fuzzes available for $100 or less, but this model is essentially three pedals in one. That's what attracted me to it, along with a few reviews in YouTube. Not to mention the bargain basement price.The three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal. The two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless.FUZZ 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound. It doesn't get too bright, until the TREBLE knob is pushed past 3 o' clock. This fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick. With humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock. I love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay. It seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes. If you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible.FUZZ 2 is more in line with the Big Muff. It has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister. With the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here. This fuzz also has more sustain than FUZZ 1, so it buzzes longer. This makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy. (Head era KoRn comes to mind for me...)The third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile. BOOST. This mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level. It actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the EQ and GAIN knobs all the way up. The resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked). Still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, BOOST does a good job of staying clean. This would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound. It might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.Overall, I like the tones this pedal spits out. I've only had it a few hours, but I love what I'm hearing so far. The build is similar to the other Behringer pedals I have, a NR100 noise reducer, and a TO800, their overdrive that sounds like a Tube Screamer. With this more recent pedal (built on June of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before. I'd still not abuse them too much, though. As always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank).You can't go wrong with the bright blue LED, either! Makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color."
767,155,4.0,Buy this. It's cheap and better than Fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much. It can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard.....Amazing sounds!
536,155,3.0,"Nice features on a pedal this cheap.  I like the capacity to independently control treble and bass.  Switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal.  Not the bulletproof construction of a Boss pedal, but I have quite a few Behringer pedals and I've yet to have a malfunction in more than a year.  I have an EH Big Muff, and this pedal is closer to that than to a Dunlop Fuzz face.  For this price, it's another great tool for your arsenal.  One thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass - if you string a bunch of them together, you are going to experience the dreaded 'tone suck'.  If most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass, you will be fine."
650,155,2.0,"There is such a thing as too much.  You'll find it in this pedal.  I have both this and the Boss distortion pedals, and prefer the Boss."
1377,155,4.0,Real good variation from full out (RAT like) to not so much saturation. The treble and bass control make HUGE sound differences. Its plastic so dont jump on it! The 1 & 2 ( I dont use the boost but its cool) make it that much more versatile. You wont be sorry! Almost bought a Big Muff or another RAT but Im glad I spent WAY less money.
365,155,4.0,"I'm an acoustic player, but every once in a while I break out the Strat just to have some fun and get a little variety.  I wanted to get some of the cool 70s fuzz going just to play around and experiment.  For me, this pedal was a great way to do that.With electric guitar, I'm not a tone freak and I don't need everything to sound 100% authentic.  For me, this pedal gets you 80% of the way there.  It has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls.If you're comparing this to $80 Boss fuzz pedal, this one is probaly a lower build quality (e.g. made from plastic), but it's also only $25.  I'm not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage, so I'll gladly take the savings."
1254,298,4.0,"None of the problems on/off that plague the Cry Baby.  Better sound too!  People are sold on that because of its association with Hendrix.  But THIS is the original, and the best.  Obligatory."
869,298,3.0,"Well long story short this is my fourth Vox wah. Others have come and gone, some have been around longer than others but this one is the newest so im still working with it. sounds like the classic v847 but has the ac plug on it, that will come in handy. not as versatile as the JS big bad wah but far less complex and less likely to have issues with dust and dirt. it has a wide sweep and killer tone but im still looking for that sweet spot that gives that wah'o sound when doing solo work. so far so good not perfect but good."
769,298,4.0,"When its about wah effects I'm too careful cuz not all brands make it well. When I found this one I can be shure that there is no more wah sound out there, crunchy, warm and with the clarity of this... I prefere vox in wah effects, and this its a great choice and its too cheap for the quality you get!! 100% happy with this... Recommended!! :)"
964,298,0.0,"I just got this and I've noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone... I have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent.  There may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you."
1188,298,4.0,"I was amazed by the quality of construction of this item. It looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows.The chrome on the sides looks very cool. Makes it look really smart.The battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom.The sound of this wah is pretty much exactly like Hendrix Clapton from the sixties. Its a wah and wah and does just that.I tried it on both clean and distorted sounds and it sounds great on both.I'm not sure if its a true bypass but I have a feeling it is. Because when its switched on without the battery there's no sound coming from it. Correct me if I""m wrong.It's different sounding from the Crybaby wah. You should listen to both to know which is right for you. I wanted the ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"" sound so I went with this."
1398,672,4.0,i started useing these about 3 yrs ago they are worth the investmentthere grat for a long performance takes alot of pressure off the shoulderif you have never used one befor try it you will like it
271,672,3.0,"The padding is comfortable but slightly heavy, Velcro flaps make installation easy. The only thing I do not like is that it is prone to slide around on my nylon strap. I will probably use double sided tape to attach it to the strap, I feel they should ave designed the inner flap with something less slippery."
1368,672,3.0,"I'm not a big fan of Planet Waves because they ruined the Dare Strap, but this is a good product - it definitely helps alleviate the weight on your shoulder."
70,672,1.0,"My hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder.  The gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy!  I found that it just added more weight.  I'm not using it.  I would look elswhere for a different product."
56,672,4.0,This strap is very comfortable! Love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar. It does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time I put it on but is so worth the final result.
1034,672,3.0,"Very big, very cushioned. I didn't notice that it helped all that much with the weight of my bass, but helped a little. Almost thought it was a little too cumbersome, kind of bit into my neck a little."
621,672,4.0,"This strap is cool, it is black, made of nice material with gel padding, and it Velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar. Like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and Velcros. Where I once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap, now I feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever. Adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar. Get it if your strap isn't feeling good, other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss. This one is legit."
848,672,1.0,To heavy....it doesn't stay where you need it. slips down becuase of wieght.. get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar...
916,305,4.0,"I love the tone! do your research though! Plenty of distortion, plenty of bass and treble, makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter!"
820,305,4.0,I own over a dozen overdrive pedals.  I know that is just insane.  this is the best I have and the best i have ever heard.  I use it after a low gain overdrive to boost my leads.  It does a great job.  tons of tonal options.  If I were to buy one od pedal it would be this or a barber
956,305,4.0,"Subjective: Nice thing is that it's fairly transparent - there's no changes to the top/bottom end that the tone knob can't fix, and it's fairly good in the transitions area. All gain pedals can do gain - but how it transitions from dirt to clean is what sets them apart...this handles it well. Pluck a string and let it sit, and it slowly cleans up. Some pedals it slowly cleans up to a point then it just goes to bleh.That said, setting it with the volume all the way up, and the drive all the way down, and roll off a bit of the tone knob to 11:00, and using the switch on LF - into the front end of my Mesa Boogie Roadster on Ch3/Modern = pure GOLD. That's the sound I've been looking for out of this amp!So far I've only used it on a few of my amps, and, so far, I've not found it to be unusable or even as a one-trick pony. I'm impressed, and that says a lot for someone who just a few years ago, hated the idea of putting anything between his guitar and his amp...if the amp couldn't do it 'naturally' when it comes to dirty tone...then it's the wrong amp...I still think that way, but a good pedal up front can add a nice twist...and goose that front end a bit where shifting channels might not be what the Dr. ordered..."
46,305,4.0,"I have to admit.  I have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my Strats.  But this pedal gives me everything that I want.The best way that I can describe the sound of the OCD is Quality and Character.As a Clean DriveWhen you uses this pedal with less drive as a clean boost for your tube amp, you will notice that it delivers a very strong character from your guitar and is very sensitive to your dynamics while playing.As an OverdriveI have loved the Ibanez TS9 because it allows a strat to keep a vocal type of midrange while having singing trebles.  When you add drive to the TS9, it retains those characteristics which is why it is the industry standard for strat guitarists who want to keep their stratty character and get the quality sound of a tube amp.The reason why the OCD is my preferred pedal over the TS9 is that it does not let the low end distort as early.  The TS9 allows you lower notes to distort earlier and seems to then amplify the signal.  The OCD gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone.  If you like blues or hard rock, you will notice that this feature is exactly what you wanted to give your playing a really strong character. You gain boldness and when your low end does gain some crunch, it is the biggest baddest tone that you could dream of.I use this pedal with my HSS strat and through a blues Jr III and use the clean boost for the coolest clean tone ever.  It allows your playing dynamics to drive the amp, not some arbitrary clipping from your pedal.  When I am playing heavier blues or rock stuff, I just turn up the drive and have the boldest and highest quality sound that I have ever played with.The HP/LP switchShifting into HP is almost like a gain boost.  I have heard it described as switching from an American Fender-y sound (LP) to a British Marshall-y sound (HP).  I guess this is a decent description.  I have found that I get a thick ballsy sound in the LP and I don't lose any quality in the HP.  It feels like you get a boost in your midrange.To conclude, I would have to say that this pedal is the perfect mix of ballsy overdrive with quality tone.  If you have a quality amp and a quality guitar, there is no reason to try and save $30 by buying an Ibanez TS9 or TS808 or TS9dx.  This pedal will make you a lot happier than those will if you like to keep your low end intact and not allow it to break up too early making it whimpy."
1157,305,4.0,"I picked up this pedal used along with DS-1 Keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think.  Long story short, the mod DS-1 is getting returned and I'm keeping my Fulltone OCD.First, a word about the negative reviews...it tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something, but the 13 other reviews (as of Sept. 2012) were all 5-star reviews. It tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didn't know what the pedal was before they tried it.  And anyone complaining about the price - this is a hand-crafted pedal that is extremely well constructed (the inside circuitry is pristine) and built to last for decades.  I think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost.Now, let's talk about how the pedal sounds!  It's marketed as an overdrive/distortion.  I had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because I indicated I was looking for a distortion pedal, but I was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has.  It is much more an ""overdrive"" in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp, but boosts the level in gain in a very full, rich sound.  The sound has a lot of ""bass"" to it, but unlike a Tubescreamer (TS-9), it's definitely not ""muddy"".  In fact, if you're tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act, this might be exactly what you need.The battery is accessible behind 4 hand screws and moderately involved to get to, but an AC adapter is really the way to go.  It's a standard plug like you find on BOSS and Ibanez pedals, but you can use a 9V or 18V.  I've read some reviewers say that 18V gives you more headroom, while some actually prefer the 9V sound.  Honestly, I tried both and didn't discern any difference - it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinets.Finally, there is an LP/HP switch, and it's really a matter of preference and setup how you use it.  I've been mostly using the LP setting, which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that I hate.  But in a live setting (or to use it as a boost for soloing), the HP setting could be quite useful, as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to ""cut through"" the other instruments on stage.If I had to summarize this pedal, I would describe it as a Tubescreamer you can rock with.  Which is not to say that it's ""better"" than the Tubescreamer, necessarily, but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone.  Put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your go-to for rhythm/chord sections, soloing, or both."
83,305,4.0,"I like a lot this pedal. It's has a deep overdrive. I'm using 18Vdc to supply power, and it deliverys a fat overdrive. I'm using a TS808 in front of OCD..."
1170,290,3.0,"I've never been much of an effect pedal guy; lots of batteries and cables when I can just get a good tone direct into my Fender tweed. I've recently conceded to using more effects and have gone, quite frankly, hog wild on new gear. This is the best of the pedal purchases I have made so far, it's not quite the MXR sound I was going for but there's definitely something here. The boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my Strat.Just two controls, one for volume, one for compression. My only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy, I haven't pulled them off yet but I would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones."
421,290,2.0,"I purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim. I was looking at some nicer ones, and decided to give it a go for only $20. It came in the mail today, and i was surprised that basic-ness of the packaging. Very little instructions at all actually.This DOES NOT ship with a 9 volt battery, and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change, as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew 4 corner screws on the back to do so. (wish there was a plastic back, or thumb screw option)This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way.Don't expect to boost your signal level with it, with the makeup gain/output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down, it was about the same volume as the original signal, only a little noisier.Did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain/add any noise when off. Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on, due to the nature of raising the noise floor.It also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boost/low cut going on. even with the sensitivity knob all the way down, it kills your low end. It is quite bright sounding.With that being said, it works wonders on single string/double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the G, B, and E strings, and makes them sound tight and full.It does seem quite durable, The case isn't made of cheap plastic, which is a good thing.Though not as rugged as some of the other pedals I would own.The switch and inputs seem a little cheap though, granted it was a $20 pedal.I feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea, however for home/non daily-use i could see it lasting a while.The LED is really bright. Almost so bright, that when you're looking to adjust the controls, it makes it somewhat hard to see what you're doing.All in all, if you're looking for a cheap compressor to boost your  treble strings and give em some extra punch, this may be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20.If you're looking for a warm full bodied compressor, this is not the choice for you. You should really wait and get the MXR Dyna Comp for just a few bucks more."
1377,290,4.0,This was EXACTLY what I needed this being the 3rd compressor I bought. I use it for vocals it drops bass a little is super quiet and has a mid range bump. So happy I got this (I got a used one and its in perfect condition so that was a bonus too) Behringer rules!
438,290,4.0,"I use several Behringer components in my set-up (e.g., my mixer, PA Speakers, effects, accessories, etc.) including this pedal.  I have confidence in the Behringer name and always feel like I'm getting a good solid piece of equipment that I can rely on.  This pedal is no exception - it's a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal.  I don't like to depend on battery power for any critical components if I don't have to so I also purchased the Behringer PSU-SB Power Supply General Purpose DC 9V Power Adaptor available on Amazon along with this.  Great price, sturdily built, great compressor effect !!!"
633,290,3.0,"For years I was lugging around a large rack case with my Mackie board and a host of rack effects (reverb, delay, compressors etc.). While using the rack I had a line from my programmable guitar effects pedal (Boss) that went to a rack compressor then out to my little Vox amp (the internal compressor in my Boss ME-30 pedal was terrible). I was very happy with this set up for about 10 years but about a year ago I stopped using the rack (smaller clubs and places with too many stairs). Since then I went to a smaller PA (Soundcraft Gigarac and some active Mackie speakers)and started using that terrible compressor in the otherwise decent Boss pedal. A few months ago I took out my old box of effects pedals and built a small pedal board. This worked great but I couldn't locate my old Ibanez CS9 compressor and years ago I know gave away my MXR. I needed a compressor pedal for my new pedal board that worked as well as the Alesis.Seems like I found a winner. This MXR clone from Behringer seems to work as well if not better than the MXR and is much quieter. Some people have mentioned a slight bump on the upper mids of the compressed signal (and I agree that it is there) but it's not hiss or added noise and I like the sound. My main guitar is a mid 90's Epiphone Sheriton and it sounds great through the Behringer DC9. I can't comment of the durability because I haven't had it that long but the case is metal and everything feels solid. I don't crank up the compression too much and I leave the pedal on about 90% of the time to control the overall signal from my pedal board (My pedals in order: Ibanez TS9, Ibanez Super Tube (a 1984 pedal that was made between the TS9 and TS10) a cheap chorus pedal, Ibanez DE7 delay into a Behringer DR600 Reverb.)For $24.00 this compressor does just what it's supposed to do. It's a two knob ""sqeezer"" just like old MXR and just works. (No need to worry about compression ratios, thresholds, release points or attack settings). Two knobs: one to set the overall compression and one to adjust the output volume. Great simple pedal clean sound.Update: I have had this pedal now for about 1 1/2 years. I notice one reviewer said that the bass sound dropped out on his guitar signal with this pedal. I have to admit that this is true. It's not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable. This pedal is not something that I would use too heavily, it does a nice job compressing peaks and overall range and gives you a nice smooth sound. If you are looking for a guitar pedal to ""sustain"" the sound you may want to look at other pedals. This is just a basic compressor not a true ""sustainer"" and at high levels it will probably make you sound very ""thin"" as the compression ratio gets above 3.5-4.0 or higher. On the other hand most stomp pedal compressors under $80-100.00 will do pretty much the same thing. My Alesis rack compressor will knock the punch out of a signal at high levels also. The sound is clean but it's best used for a little compression, not the huge amounts needed to call it a ""sustainer"". Try the Behringer CS400 for more sustain."
52,290,4.0,"I do own a few Behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range, and this pedal will stay in my collection.I've spent $200+ for a few of my pedals, but I order and try many other pedals within the same effects range, because some I believe are just to costly for what you get, and the sound quality usually are not that far apart.I would put this pedal in that category. This is my 1st compressor pedal and while I dint think I really needed this type of pedal, for the price I thought I would give it a try... WOW! The Behringer DC9 Dynamics Compressor Pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal-board, plus I get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set. So I can go quiet on an apartment at late hours, with a 100 watt amp, that's nice.So I would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal."
455,290,4.0,"Not the same as a MXR so don't get your hopes up on that. It is however a great compressor for the money and useful for many applications, I find myself using it for bass more than guitar but its great for either."
1340,290,4.0,"Let's face it, I'm sure there are better compressors than this for about 3 to 4 times the price but this brought my amp into the light. Bright, crisp, clean, balanced sound reproduction. Got the Danelectro wall wart for it. Worked great. The free shipping was lighting fast and I got more than I bargain for. Get one!"
997,523,4.0,"I love these picks, they are my favorite! I bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year. These picks are sturdy and wont break that easily. I use them for rhythm runs and even lead. They are perfect for rhythm, flexible. My only wish is if they had some grip (raised end where you hold). For lead these sound dull. I much prefer a brighter, more chimey sound.Overall great product! Get it..."
1388,523,3.0,"To me, there's not too much depth you can go into when describing guitar picks. Either they feel good in your hand, or they don't. Either they kind of &#34;disappear&#34; when you're playing, or they feel like a hindrance. These Dunlops get it just right. Enough grip to where you're not fumbling all over the place, and they somehow get out of the way of your playing. They're right up there with the Fender Classic picks, as my all-time favorites to use."
1321,523,3.0,"I love guitar picks. I have tested  alot of them, and this is by far the best one that I have found yet. They are perfect to hold, and very tough, although I do wear through them quickly, but I do that to all picks."
886,523,3.0,Almost a perfect pic for me. I use a .73mm. Just wish it was more like a fender pic finish...that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better. This pic seems to have a coating that makes is slightly softer to the touch or something.  Still prefer this pic to the fender because this one holds up much much better- in comparison to fender mediums.
930,523,4.0,"hands down my absolute favorite pick. I have tried many brands, materials & various thicknesses but I always come home to the Dunlop Tortext Red .50mm!"
1180,523,4.0,"Between the blue and the yellow, I have my needs covered.  These have a weird feeling when you first get them, like they have powder on them.  But within 10 minutes of using it, it'll stick with you much better.  I love these picks."
1262,523,4.0,"I've tried every gimmicky thing you can imagine and have always gone back to what simply works, these Dunlop Tortex .73mm picks, I've tried different brands, shapes and sizes and they all just get in the way, these aren't slick like some of the others, they stay in my hand and they wear ok (as long as I don't get too wild) and if I ever do drop one they show up super easy on the floor due to their bright yellow color, I would be lost if they quit making these or changed them any, hopefully they don't, these are great!"
438,523,4.0,"I always keep a lot of these on hand. These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals). Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks. These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used. For example, I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks. The weight is great for my style of playing. They seem more durable than other brands. They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand. I love 'em, use them daily, and rely on them !!!"
1352,523,4.0,"These picks are great, the best part is the 72 pack. I always have spares. This is a thicker pick, I would recomend you actualy try one before you by 72 of them. The only complaint comes from my wife, since they tend to pop up all over the house!"
496,523,4.0,I'm a beginner guitar player going on intermediate and I've quickly learned that anything from Jim Dunlop is quality stuff.
227,855,4.0,"Dunlop slides are nice and smooth with rounded edges, they sound great, they're indestructable (so far) and they're supremely affordable.  I own a few of them.  I prefer a shorter one most of the time, but I use this one often, as well.Sure, you can spend more on a slide, but I see no reason to."
1141,855,4.0,Unfortunately I wasn't aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when I need the large. The medium fits over my pinky finger and while that's okay I prefered it fit over my index finger where I'd have more control.I cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so I'll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger Dunlop 212 Slide.
1204,855,4.0,"works well.  the glass is a much softer, more subtle sound than metal.  it works on my pinky finger.  would have to have a much larger one for my ring finger and I dont have particularly large hands.  Just don't drop one of these on you tile floor.  they explore quite nicely that way.  I keep mine in a protective case when I am not using it."
1110,855,4.0,Don't know why I didn't buy this years ago. I had a metal slide for years but always like a glass slide sound tone more. I like Dunlop products... they are always good quality. Price with Amazon Prime is a good buy.
1301,855,2.0,"I thought my fingers were medium according to the sizing guide, but no, my fat fingers are not medium."
772,855,4.0,new to playing slide guitar  I have lots of fun with this one  it is fragile so care must be taken as to not drop it ... would buy more from this company
331,855,3.0,"I originally purchased the large size and found it to be a bit too big, thus I wanted to try the medium. It's much smaller than the large, but it fits my fingers well (I'd say I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy). The glass is pretty thin, so it is not as sturdy as the large, but I think it should last a while. As long as you don't drop it all the time, it should be ok. Definitely recommend this slide (especially for its price)."
184,855,4.0,"Very nice guitar slide. The glass is nice, slides very well on my electric and acoustic, and it fits like a mitten."
716,855,4.0,A must for every serious guitar player. This is one of the easiest to use slides that I have ever owned & I have been playing for about 45 years. I play mostly classic rock & this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case.This holds up very well because I have a way of abusing a slide. Dunlop does it again.
586,358,3.0,"I have a large hand and this slide is very loose on my finger. I will order a smaller size. I am trying to learn a few slide riffs. This thick glass sounds fantastic on the strings, My bad for ordering one too large."
1304,358,4.0,"I found the price on Amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it. The slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acoustic/electric guitar and also sounds great with a Cigar Box Guitar with piezo pickup. The slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle, ring and pinky finger.I found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better IMO. I have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar, but a Dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchase.Jim Dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part, their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and I think this one will last a long time."
331,358,3.0,"For what it's supposed to do, it works very well. I also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better I think. This is still usable, but it is for very big fingers. I think I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there, but this still leaves some extra room. Either way, it works well. It feels very sturdy and I'm not worried about it cracking anytime soon. For the price, it's a must have."
293,358,4.0,"I have large hands (I wear an XXL glove) but I guess not thick fingers (Ring Size 12/13). If you want to use this one on your ring finger, consider getting a smaller size.As for the tone of the slide, it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass!"
1080,358,3.0,"This is my first slide, I never use slide to play my guitar, look good size is right for me. I just have to learn how to use it ;-)"
1349,358,4.0,"I bought this along with a Clayton ""large"" glass slide.  Well the Clayton was very thin walled and didn't even fit over my ring finger knuckle.  This slide is very thick and works great!"
609,358,4.0,I thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big. It really doesn't affect play at all so it doesn't matter.
1081,852,4.0,"I agree with all the other reviews. These are high quality sounding, very comfortable (I have a big head too!), durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack. Unless you make money with your headphones (or have money to burn) you probably don't need anything better than the M50's. The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans - they make the headphones take up less room when folded (good for travelling) but I'm old fashioned and prefer rigid phones, they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don't have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation. No big deal though! Comes with nice screw on 1/8"" to 1/4"" adaptor."
15,852,4.0,"Bought these to plug into practice bass amp (wifey a little nasty when I get itch to play at 2 am).  I play 5 string and I could not believe the deep sound I get out of these, especially in this price range.  Highly recommend!"
859,852,4.0,I've been using Sennheiser's for years and while I am very pleased with them I decided to try the ATH-M50Ss on a whim.  I spent a little more ($50) than what I've been paying for the Sennies but it was well worth it.  I get more of a flat response which is exactly what I needed for monitoring my audio mixes.And a trivial bonus ... a straight cord.  I hate coiled cords.
139,852,4.0,These headphones are amazing! They are absolutely fantastic for the price!The only problem I face is that they hurt my head from the pressure of wearing them. But I just need to stretch them out!
818,852,4.0,"I bought these to replace a pair of ATH-M45s I had for 6 years. I used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio. These have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully. I play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what I hear inside the headphones. Listening to music on them is a joy. Everyone has an opinion about a &#34;burn in&#34; period, mine seemed to open up at about 50-60 hours. I listen to music about 3 - 4 hours a day."
840,852,4.0,They sound just like i thought they would.  I love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome.I would buy these again.
577,852,4.0,"I also own Bose Quiet Comfort 15's and AE2's, and the Grado S80i's. these have become my favorites. The Grado's have tight but somewhat weak bass, and amazing (but sometimes too shrill), and airy mids and high's with a great soundstage; both Bose's have more pronounced bass than the Grado's, and good mids and highs, but less airy and soundstage than the Grado's, and the audio-technica's are in between, with the best balance between accurate and pronounced (but not excessively) bass, excellent mids and highs, and very good soundstage. They have become my favorite phones. Though the bass is pronounced, it is with an accurate depth, and a THUD like a top-line subwoofer, when the bass drum hits. All in all quite a listening experience."
308,852,3.0,"These headphones are kind of classics.  Very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites.  They are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones.  However, when I compare them to my other headphones (Sennheiser HD595's) I find that these are very, very inferior.  I had originally intended for them to be used with my digital piano because I wanted some isolation, which my HD595's do not provide.  These do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior.  I think closed-style headphones are just not up to the task of reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones.I use these at work now.  They are excellent at blocking out room noise and they provide enough quality for me to listen to music while working.Unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my Sennheisers.  They are a bit too small for my ears, I guess. And they get hot.  Overall they are just not as good.  They were a good price, though, and they fill a niche that I need.  If only I could find a set of really high quality closed cans for my piano now..."
956,852,4.0,"My main headphones before were HD-280's, which I thought were pretty good, until I got these. I have several pair of HD-280's, one for mixing audio, one for practicing with drums (since they have decent isolation), and one for 'her' to use.I have one of these, and the amount of detail is great. I have a set of M-Audio BX8a's, and these have a touch more clarity, which considering the price difference...wow. For mixing audio though, can't use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right, but, I think these will get used for mixing more and more, with the finalizing on the BX8a's.I didn't know headphones could sound this good."
1115,852,0.0,"garbage if you like it...then buy it.this is NOT how the world of music sounds.TOO MUCH BASS and other garbage...are you guys really HEARING anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981...more and more..we lost analog, we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3, and now to put morecrap into our ears, they give you ONEfrequency...bass ONLY , take it or leave it.will go find REal headphones, thanks.kb"
69,852,4.0,I've tried different kinds of headphones in the past and so far the Bose AE2 fits my taste. I've been using it for years when my son borrowed it a month ago and I'm pretty sure he has no intention of giving it back :) (Its the 5th headphone he borrowed) so I planned to buy another one but I said to myself why not try something different. After reading all the reviews on this product I finally decided to go for it. And WOW...i was blown away. I'm glad I tried something else. No regrets. This one really fits my taste. The clarity is superb and the bass is awesome.
1004,852,3.0,"First time I've spent over 25 bucks for headphones.  Use for both reference with a GNX4 and guitar, and easy listening.  Very accurate and no coloration of tone that I can detect.  (semi-audiophile)A bit bass heavy but overall great headphones. very comfortable.  get hot to wear in the summer!"
817,852,4.0,"If your goal is to use these for mixing, then just hit the buy button.I have about 6 sets of various headphones from low end to nice gamer phones, and these will allow you to hear sounds that your other phones will not.I use these to mix down multi-track audio and then compare the final mix with a set of regular monitors."
653,852,4.0,"I mix and master all my own music on these guys. Before the audiophiles try to stone me to death, listen! I cant have giant KRK monitors blasting in my small apartment, but what I can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light. These are not Beats by Dre, they will not make all your songs have super bass, and they aren't a great fashion statement; however, they ARE work horses and will show you how your music REALLY sounds. Nicer headphones exist, true, but these are the best in their price range in my opinion."
1158,852,4.0,I play Guitar for the first time i have a head set that the drivers are not being over driving giving a distorted sound. The calrity is amazing !
892,852,3.0,"I've owned these for several years and found them sufficient for mixing purposes -- so long as I keep using reference songs for comparison ... that's because by themselves, the ATH-M50 don't have a flat frequency response. They're flatter than most phones under a hundred, but you will find that they're a bit too middy and lacking in lower treble regions compared with a good set of studio monitors.Fortunately, I found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective EQ curve. Load up a parametric EQ and do the following: [+1dB @ 80Hz Q of 5],  [+1.5dB @ 350Hz Q of 2], [-2.5 dB @ 1kHz Q of 1], [+1dB @ 3kHz Q of 1], [+2dB @ 6.5kHz Q of 3.5], and [+1.5dB @ 15kHz Q of 3].  Save this as a preset.If you listen to reference songs with this, you'll find a more pleasing, balanced, 3D kind of sound compared to the original.  I base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the ATH-M50. The proof that this worked is that now these headphones sound a lot like my good studio monitors. They translate better with the correction curve active.The bass on these is solid and seems to go down to 20Hz or so, more felt than heard. Subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound. This is where these headphones are better than studio monitors, unless you have a well treated room with a good sub. I therefore use these headphones to adjust bass, in relation to the reference songs. I also use them for editing slight sounds (pops, clicks) and getting reverb tails right, and with help panning tracks -- they are VERY good for this, like a magnifying glass.The foam pads and black 'paint' on the headband will crack and fall off after 2 years. I wrapped black sports tape around the headband, works well. Replacement pads can be bought on Amazon. So the padding material coating could have been better made.  That plus the middy frequency response is why I give 4 stars instead of 5.  But I still think they're the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred."
1397,852,4.0,"As background, I've recorded many jazz performances and listen normally to electrostatic speakers and have a pair of electrostatic headphones as well as dynamic models.These Audio Technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise. That said they are more difficult to design well as the closed ear cups and back create acoustic interaction with the back of the drivers. These headphones have a very open sound, smooth midrange, excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid, and perhaps a bit emphasized bass.They are extremely comfortable, well made and easy to store. Finally the pricing of these fine headphones are not over inflated as are many high quality products. Highly recommended."
1248,852,4.0,"Bought these as the studio I was using had a very rough, taped together set of headphones and they told me most people bring there own.  Did a quick search for good quality studio quality headphones and settled on these for my choice.  I am not disappointed.  Excellent sound quality and I would pin them against Bose any day."
66,852,3.0,"These headphones are wonderful to wear.  They sound great.  But that's not enough now a days.  With the head band being connected to the outside of the muff, they fit your head so wide.  The pioneer hdj 2000 has the look.  Read my review on those though.  They are terrible.At first glance these things are serious pro grade, they are made of very durable components. Both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head. The head band isn't bad, it's a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued. Not really a big concern though. They have a long cord, and I'll talk more about it later. It ends with a spin on 1/4 in or a standard 3.5mm.The sound out of these things is pristine. It's not muddy and very clear. They have a good amount of bass.  Because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don't leak noise like a lot of headphones do.Pros- Heavy duty- Awesome sound- Comfortable headband- Over ear design- Not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag- Always clear, never muddy, even at high volumes- Very clear left and right ear markings- Spin on 1/4 PlugCons- Heavy coil cord- Heavy (weight never got annoying though)- Looks"
144,594,4.0,"I'm using this in V1 in a 5 watt tube amp.  It's really nice.  I tried the NOS route and I much prefer this tube.  The other good thing is it comes in a box from JJ, unlike some tubes from other places I've ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them."
1383,594,2.0,"I have a VOX AC4TV. It uses (stock) a 12AX7, but I thought I would try the 12AT7 just to see what happened. I had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom.After a little test run, my first impression was that the amp was noticeably quieter with this tube installed. It might have reduced the volume by a third or more - but this came with the benefit of the amp being noticeably less noisy. That was a nice benefit.I didn't notice much of a change tonally. I think this tube basically brought the volume down. I wouldn't say this is better or worse than the 12AX7, just quieter, and with significantly less output.I ended up switching back to the 12AX7."
161,594,3.0,"I bought this tube to test in a friends Fender HRD in the PI spot. He wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain. He liked the result when I switched out the GT 12AX7. I want to try a JAN 12AT7 next, but the JJ is doing a good job for now. Also interested in swapping out his GT (Sovtek) 5881's for JJ 6L6GC's."
639,594,3.0,"I found this tube to sound pleasant, be cheaper in cost than the Electro-Harmonix, and work, unlike the Electo-Harmonix tubes I received."
894,594,4.0,"JJ's are great tubes! This 12AT7 replaced a 12AX7 in the preamp of an Epi Valve Jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone- it was very nice, but I found an old American made 12AU7 that I like more- the JJ is still a great tube."
767,679,2.0,"MXR make pretty good Pedals for the money. I thought that this would be a high output, saturated type distortion. It is not. It has plent of Volume, which is good for boosting. But, even with the Gain Knob turned all the way up, this thing is an Overdrive. Which is not a bad thing, if that's what you are looking for. Very Mid-Rangey sound as well. Just not for me. But it's well built and would make a decent OD. But, overall, a pretty Vanilla flavored Dirt Pedal."
1321,679,2.0,"I was looking for an Overdrive or Distortion pedal for classic rock, and I finally decided on this one. It's a decent pedal, very solid. However, it is VERY noisy and buzzy when not in use, although all of my distortions are. It sounds a little bit thin and hollow to my ears; it's ok, but I wouldn;t purchase it again or really record with it. It's very light and thin sounding. I'm probably going to get a Full-Tone OCD or something like that instead"
401,679,4.0,"This is another in the MXR ""Distortion"" line. The Distortion III has a more overdrive flavor than a high gain pedal like the Boss Metal Zone or the Barber Dirty Bomb but is very flexible. Not really for heavy metal (see the MXR 116 Fullbore Metal) but more for that AC/DC and classic rock sound.There is a lot of gain on tap from the output section so it is possible to hit the front of a tube amp hard without turning up the distortion. The tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable.The good thing about this pedal apart from the price is you do not get that ""fizzy"" top end that some pedals have when you crank the distortion. In addition, the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob.Pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly."
417,679,3.0,"I use this guy with a Fender Twin, since Overdrive sound is not enough for now a days metal. Not much of noise and practical carry. If you really want to go for something a bit more &#34;Marshall JCM900 like&#34;... get a MXR Custom Badass '78 Distortion. For a extreme... get a Riot!"
514,679,3.0,"I was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive. I don't hold it against the pedal though. I have a Marshall Class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive I get from the amp, I say this as a compliment. In my case, however, why would I want to replicate what I already have? I'm gonna return it and save up some money to get a BB preamp. You should check out the 78 Badasss Distortion from MXR too."
806,652,4.0,I am not one to spend a lot on batteries so this was a no brainer. It has worked great now for over a year at least. I had to look it up and I have had this for 3 years tomorrow.
461,652,4.0,"just make sure you get this when you get the tascam. I didn't run it without this power source, that seems too ghetto. they should just jack the price to what it would be with this and viola! but what do I know."
606,652,4.0,"Works just fine for the Tascam DP-008 I also bought through Amazon, and saves a lot of batteries. What else can you say? It works."
1205,652,0.0,"If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder, I have a less expensive solution for you:  if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port. That's a lot cheaper than spending twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart!"
304,588,4.0,behringer perfect pedalboardI can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb1000 from costa rica I recommend it....thanks behringer
443,588,4.0,"I bought this so I had no mess with cables on the board and I'm happy to say it works perfectly. It has everything you could ask for on a PedalBoard and not only works with Behringer, I have Suhr, Boss, Fender, Marshall, Dunlop and TC pedals and they fit very well. It comes with cables and configuration diagram ideas, not to mention it's a great advantage for taking it on the road without having to dissemble everything. Now my gear is always ready."
877,588,4.0,"Our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation, and plenty of connection cords. He has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses. It looks very stylish and functional as well."
292,588,4.0,Very good product.  Bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1.  It comes with a Daisy Chain power cord that eliminates the need for separate power supplies. Foam inserts easily fit Boss and Behringer pedals but can be easily cut to house other pedals.
1418,588,4.0,"I purchased this because even though I use mostly Boss effects, I also use a Behringer Hell-babe Wah. Some of the reviews mentioned that Boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a 'footprint' for a wah type effect. I must say thanks to those reviewers! The only issue I have is that I'm kinda slow, so it took me a while to realize that I had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably. I was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict, but so far it has been a perfect experience! This is such a sturdy board. I must say though, that I had no idea it would be so huge! This is a perfect addition to any serious rig. UPDATE 21/6/10: I've finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the Boss Phase Shifter. So far this board has performed superbly! Yes, there is some noise (as there always is when using overdrive/distortion pedals), but no more than is to be expected. I use a Boss Noise Suppressor (Sorry if this is beginning to look like a Boss ad) and it works perfectly!"
1222,504,3.0,"I've had this for several years. It has worked flawlessly. It has done a pretty good job with many recordings, especially in the field. Zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior.  At the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class."
1090,504,4.0,I just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away. Excellent fer recording acoustic's
632,504,4.0,"This small device has amazing quality. The built-in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand-held mono-recorders. Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise (like reviews state) but when used on low-gain, record quite well. Audio-IN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer (I used a Behringer U-802) for AMAZINGLY clear recordings. Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device. Even NiMH (1.2V) batteries can power this, although alkaline (1.5V) last longer.CON: The plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully."
1396,504,3.0,"I also own an Olympus LS-10.  This gives me the same recording ability 96/24 but it is much less expensive.  You do get the ability to record with four channels which I am dying to try once I get my hands on 5.1 encoding software.  Also nice and not included with other brands, A tripod to hold the unit, a handle to use the unit like a microphone, charger, and earbuds.Some have noted the zoom doesn't have speakers built in.  If you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it.  You need monitors or quality headphones.  I find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments.As I said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material.  Olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls.  This may be a big issue if you don't treat your equipment carefully.  Time will tell, but I have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money.I am also looking at the Zoom H1 which will come out in Sept. 2010.  This product may actually be the LS-10 killer."
339,504,4.0,"There are so many reviews of this little jewel, I won't bother going into details but it's everything I could have hoped for and more. The sound quality is amazing and it's very easy to use. I'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck. I take it everywhere and it has never let me down. I had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that ARE included, I have no complaints."
335,504,4.0,awesome product works great. it even lets you set your level recording options for low or high level or between settings.it has lots of cool features listed in the manual are clearly defined how to use in manual.short version it's awesome.
1284,504,3.0,"I play and teach classical guitar and needed a good digital recorder with which to record myself and my students and also be able to convert to mp3 format to upload to the internet.  I've recorded several solo pieces and it does pick up the guitar very well, including all string squeaks and fret buzzes (darn it).  So, it will force you to clean up your playing a bit.  If you are a musician and want a recorder that is very portable and relatively easy to use, then this little gadget is quite good.  It won't give you ""recording studio"" quality, but you can clearly hear the deep tones of a classical guitar and no hiss, or background noise (unless you have big-mouthed birds like I do) so you're recording is very clear.When I get ready to record, I set the gain as described in the manual, then set the recorder on my music stand and begin playing.  Since I bought the 4G card, I can play the piece as many times as I need too in a row without worrying about it running out of memory just as I finally play the piece to my specifications.  Also, if you connect the H2 to an electrical outlet and not rely on the batteries, that is one less worry.  Your H2 won't die during recording because the batteries give out.I can't really tell any difference in the recording quality with or without the wind sock that came with it.  It sounds the same.  I guess if I were a singer I would use it to screen out wind but a guitar doesn't really need it.  Yes, the screen is very small and difficult to read - I keep a magnifying glass handy, but now I've pretty much got the button pushing sequences memorized and don't need to use it as often to see the screen.  Also, download a free editing program such as ""Audacity"" so you can convert your recordings to various formats.I'd give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial.  It seems fragile and I dropped it once but luckily it bounced off my foot which had a big fuzzy house shoe on it so it didn't break.  But it might have if I had not broken it's fall.  And you will need a longer USB cord.  I can't believe the one they sent was so short.  But that is a very easy fix and overall this is one nice little tool.  And for the price, I'd buy it again!  :-}UPDATE 2.22.12I'm still using the H2 Zoom on almost a daily basis to record my students playing and my own playing.  I still love it, it works great and I feel I really purchased a great item."
318,504,4.0,"I'm raising my rating, and the result?  Getting ""demoted"" from the front page.  In any case, even though I recently picked up the Sony PCM-D50 from Amazon, I'm sufficiently impressed by the Zoom H2 to give it 5 stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of 8-16 track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders.  For quite a while its only competition was the Edirol-R09, but as the price has come down, the Zoom H2 stands out from its immediate competition. Currently, the H2 is my ""back-up"" unit.  But for convenience or stealth purposes, I often use it as my main recorder.Anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed.  Production values haven't been spared in terms of the packaging; the included equipment (no batteries but a power adapter, protective pouch, handy table stand, mic stand adapter, wind screen, ear buds, USB cable, and a 256mb SD card); and the manual (a quick set-up sheet plus an ample booklet with generous-sized print written in clear, idiomatic English that makes some of Sony's recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparison).The screen and controls, admittedly, are minuscule, requiring sharp eyes (though the screen is well-illuminated) and nimble fingers (I much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my Sony to the touch-pad of the Zoom).  What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price, is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind.  It's not simply another ""guitar player's gadget,"" loaded down with an endless supply of effects, loops, rhythm and bass tracks, files within files, programs buried within programs.  The H2, unlike my pricey Sony, can handle both .wav and mp3 protocol, has microphone fields ranging from 90 degrees to 360 degrees,  is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files, offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures, conversations, solo performers and orchestras.  In short, the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or more--and in a practical digital storage card format.Other Pluses:  Although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone (the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by Sony, costing $60 and $90 respectively), the Zoom onboard mic (actually 4) is darn good.  It captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clock's  chimes from upstairs.  And it's reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past (a single tiny hole is more common these days).  Getting the recorded signal onto a computer's hard-drive is expedited with the included USB.2 cable, and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like Cool Edit (which I strongly recommend over editing in the recorder).  There's also a metronome on board (potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions) and a tuner (useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recording).Possible drawbacks: 1. Zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistles--limiters, compressors, cut-off levels, AGC control, auto-dynamic levels, sensitivity ratios, panning effects, and the list goes on.  It's too easy to miss a step, to waste precious time fumbling with the menu, to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments.  Moreover, the instructions, while clear and abundant, omit much information that would help the beginner.  The hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone who's a complete newbie to someone who's a knowledgeable aficionado.  And I have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screen's menu to get to a metronome or tuner. (Frankly, with 75 kids squirming in their seats I'd go to the old single-function, dial-up, block-shaped metronome without a second thought.)2. The H2 is so light that using it with the AC adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely.  Undoubtedly you'll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries (it takes only 2) to record in the field.  At standard MP3 (128-meg) quality, you should be good for dozens of hours.  (The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder.)3. My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site. After having some difficulty with the install, I decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in ""real time.""What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price (2/3 of the H4, 1/2 of the Edirol R-9) is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind.Perhaps the primary deal-maker or breaker: The tiny screen and small controls.  Until mastering the miniaturization, I would want to have a ""back-up"" cassette recorder for any performance that I judged of special importance.  As for build quality, my H2 is like new after almost 18 months use. Undoubtedly you'll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries (it takes 2) to record in the field.  At standard MP3 (128-meg) quality, you should be good for dozens of hours.  (The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder.)My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site. After having some difficulty with the install, I decided to forget about it--especially after seeing how slow (I mean really, ""overnight"" slow) the machine is in ""Normalizing"" a long file or converting it from .wav to mp3.  What takes minutes with a software program like Sound Studio or WireTap Studio requires hours when you're using the Zoom as a computer interface.  Use it for what it does best--namely, produce realistic audio from a tiny, weightless, durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame  its expensive rivals."
275,504,4.0,Excellent Sound quality.Very functional and easy to work with.Small enough to take along.It is my most used Gear in my life right now. I don't want anything else.
336,866,2.0,"Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat?  You can't with this!  It's too narrow at 17 inches.  I am going with a wider one.  (other than that is seems decent)Updated March 4th, 2014: I ordered the On Stage KT7800 and have had it for several weeks now.  I am much happier with it, and it is easier to adjust.  The first one I ordered was defective and I had to send it back, butt now I am good to go."
1363,866,4.0,"I ordered this bench for last Christmas (2005). I'm satisfied so far. Good value for money.The seat is generously padded and is 2.5 inches thick. Padding material is not too soft, and that is good in my opinion.All-steel frame construction feels sturdy.Contrary to one of the reviews, my bench came with height adjustment (it is not on-the-fly kind of thing, though). Each of the legs has 3 holes (low, middle, high). A fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs, and the bolt becomes the crossing point of ""X"". Three positions roughly correspond to 18, 19 and 20 inches.For changing height, all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt, insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it. Don't worry, you don't need any tool to do the job,  thanks to a large plastic knob. See the picture and you'll understand how it works.Mine initially came with middle position. I also tried high and low, but set it back to middle. It seems to be a good compromise for my family, as the bench is used daily by me, my wife and my kids. Sure it's nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily. However, with this price, I wouldn't complain at all."
225,866,4.0,This is perfect for our digital piano.  We love it.  Easy assembly.  I would recommend this to anyone.
282,866,3.0,"This bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods. My only complaint is that I wish it had  just a little more height adjustment- maybe 1 inch. Overall, it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child."
1331,866,4.0,"Pretty straight forward bench. I was surprised at how comfy it was at the price. Good height, comfortable, Id buy it again, no questions asked."
1346,567,0.0,"the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES"
546,567,4.0,These are nicely made and the one I bought is working well. I'm very happy with it and will buy more as I need more.
773,567,4.0,It is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well. Looks like it is holding up so far.
1243,567,4.0,For the price these can't be beat. At this price it doesn't hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency
1029,567,4.0,good cable doesn't tangle very good ends
1127,567,2.0,The Cable is good and normal . good price and works well. The rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and I have to push them in place all too often.
24,567,3.0,"I've kinda forgot I even bought this, it's just another cable in the mess of cables I already have! But it works fine, never had any problems with it. I think it's going through a cheap microphone I have, so It shouldn't be put through any conditioning. I think it would do fine in a live setting as well."
864,567,4.0,"Sold, great quality XLR Mic. It's pretty hard to mess these up. People often build their own, but when they're this cheap, why go through the trouble?"
175,567,1.0,"I have finally learned my lesson.I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say ""good for static applications"" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work.A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple ""does it work yes/no"" is clearly not good enough, as i learned"
1273,567,4.0,I'm using four of these for Podcasting - they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used I am completely happy.
564,567,4.0,This cable is great for XLR microphones or DI-boxes.  They are clean of any electrical noise and appear to be good quality.
910,567,4.0,For the price this product is ideal.  I find myself wishing I had ordered more.  It is perfect for the home studio and is budget friendly.  I shall  probably get three or four more.
702,567,2.0,"Cable worked fine, but the strain relief for the cable end came out when I took it out of the package. You can even see it on the left in the picture that it's crooked because there's barely anything holding it in, so it provides no protection for the cable. Signal seems fine, so if you're not going to use it or move it around alot, it works. If you're going to be gigging with it, I'd get something with a real strain relief."
265,567,4.0,"Good quality cable. Actually much better than I expected for the price. I don't move around much, so I don't know about how rugged it would be out on the road, but the cable is flexible and should stand up to a lot of rolling and unrolling."
1068,567,2.0,"it's 6 bucks so I didn't expect a lot from it, but it works as advertised.  not sure how long the connectors will last though as they do look to be lower quality.  the cable wire is rubber coated and is easy to roll and store, the wire is very thin."
1188,567,4.0,I;ve ahd this cable pair for more than 2 years and have had no problems with them at all. I used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones.Here are their key points:+ Good quality construction.+ Secured heads.+ VERY long cable.+ NO signal problems.+ Overall great cable.+ Buy with confidence.
1214,567,4.0,"cable works perfect no defects, cystal clear sound, constructed well, use them in the studio, no noticiable problems, do not know how road worthy they are because I am a studio rat and not performer."
946,567,3.0,Bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable.  Now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want.
915,567,4.0,I don't use it for any heavy use.  I use it for podcasting purposes.  Haven't had any problems.  So I can't speak to really heavy use of the product.
854,567,0.0,"Be careful; I have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. They were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. Seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.Fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. I actually had two blow at one time, and thought my PA was shot. Thankfully, it was just these cables. NOT GOOD. Spend a little extra on another brand. These have been my favorite:GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords"
1159,567,4.0,"What can I say? It's a mic cable haha. It's a great cable for the price. It sounds good, and seems to be very durable. It's not a monster cable, but considering its 1/5 of the price, I can't complain."
1002,567,3.0,"I ordered this as a spare and at this time, I haven't used it.  My microphone came with it's own cable and this was for a &#34;What if&#34; situation.  I gave it 4 stars on just expectation."
64,567,4.0,"Just as good as any 20' XLR out there.Considering I spent $6.00 for it,it rules! Will buy more when needed."
244,567,3.0,works well when jumping or combining your system with XLR's  for noise  and clear sound. ease in connecting and reconnecting system
261,690,4.0,"Wow. This amp is something else. When it arrived I almost didn't realize what it was because it was so big! This thing does everything! You can set drums, record cords over it and then dub in to the already recorded track and solo over it! But what's even better is you can attach drums to it, a bass to it, a mic to it, and a guitar to it and have a killer jam session!It has more sounds then I had time to comb through at first glance and more features then I know what to do with!AMAZING AMPLIFIER!"
1110,690,4.0,"Like another reviewer here, I too own a Fender G-Dec 30 (BTW: now going up for sale). The Spider Jam 75W specs are all out there so I won't repeat all that info but give you my users impressions instead. First I was fortunate enough to buy one for $300. (the same price as the Fender G-Dec 30), so it's an even simpler comparison for me.***The Line 6 Spider Jam 75W is a full head & shoulders taller and better than the G-Dec.***As just simply an amp it has more power & as good of sound. As for the rest, I'll take line 6's real drums sets and myriad of song backings over the Fender's midi/synthe tunes any day. The ability to save your custom tunes as JAM or WAV files internally or out to a larger SD card is a godsend and to me, the single biggest factor to own this amp over a G-Dec. (I use the max 2gb SD - note: it must be fat 16 formatted & is not HC.) The overdub layering is simply superb (though it's saved as mono). The XLR mike, 1/4"" plug aux & MP3 inputs allow a great flexibility for total song creation. Coupled with my Line 6 Variax guitar, I have been able to produce an amazing range of sounds and songs.The only criticisms I can muster are: 1) - The menu process is more difficult than the G-Dec but easy enough with hands-on experience. 2) - The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough. 3) - Line six really needs to update to an SDHC format so it can utilize larger than 2gb SD storage cards. I have experimented with using a 4GB non-HC SD card & though I was able to format it, I was not able to read / write to it. Line 6, please go to SDHC! I would also like to see an improvement to an ""incremented"" or notched amp model selector pot. As every once in a while it will jump from the A or B selection if not exact."
673,690,4.0,I can't find a single complain about this amp. The amp modelling is fantastic. Plug in for a mic/CD/M3 player. Quality driver. I'm not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website. I used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects. Only thing I wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds. But you can't ask for much more for the price of $399. You won't be disappointed with this amp.
1200,690,4.0,"I bought my Spyder Jam back in 2009, when it was fairly new.  I was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp.  I still am.  It's just possibly one of the best training and gigging tools for a guitarist out there.  You can play along with a drum track, with a drum AND rythmn track, and you get hundreds of presets and about 100 to make your own.  the Spyder pedals make it perfect, allowing you to turn on recording functions, drum and other functions, and also with the expression pedal, you get Wah and Volume.  The seperate tonal controls are great on this amp, and if you really dive deep into the menus, pitch shifting and timing are also available.  And with 24 minutes of looping time, that's just crazy for the price.I found it interesting that for a while, the Spyder IV 75 watter kind of dissapeared off the market in 2011 and part of 2012. It has basically the same presets of the Jam without the looper or drum and rythmn tracks, and was much less money.  I'd say it started to cut into Spyder Jam sales. I have noticed that the Spyder IV 75 watter is back now, but the Jam keeps right on going, with updates and endless support from Line 6.Even the eight year run of the Fender Cyber Twin, and Cyber Twin SE didn't offer the possibilities of the Spyder Jam, and the Cyber Twin was well over $1000 new. Yes, it has a tube preamp, and rewires itself to better simulate amps, but the Jam is SO much more in line with the budgets of up and coming guitarists. No contest, money-wise. And the Cyber-Twin is gone now.If you want an amp that you will keep for a long, long time, take a real hard look at the Spyder Jam."
617,690,4.0,"I've had this Amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great. Took a while for me to learn all the things that the Jam can do since I was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when I received it. Crank this baby up and it moves air. I've used all the in's and out's with no problems. My rig consists of an Ibanez AS73, Schecter Devil Custom 2008, Line 6 HD500, and an AKG Perception 420 thru a Line 6 UX2. Finally, I only play at home so this gear doesn't get banged up from gigging.I agree here> (As B. Russell said: The only downside I can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged. There are a lot of features on this amp, but you need to learn how to use them. The common features are easy to use, but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp, you will need to invest some time into it. Since I'm not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual, this amp fits me well.)"
972,345,2.0,"I'm a beginner and is more than enough for now. if i'm committed to learning, i'll get a better one later!"
404,345,3.0,"Small size, easy to transport, and more than enough power to annoy a small venue with my lousy (but improving) guitar playing :-p"
1288,345,4.0,"this amp is small in size but full of sound.  because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks!! very responsive, very clean sounding. this amp is well worth the price."
1234,345,4.0,I got This amp for my 9 year old son along with a Squire mini strat. Verry good combination. My son loves them both.
763,345,3.0,"I bought this used off a friend when I got my first Electric.  It's a great little practice amp that is plenty loud enough for a small room.  The destortion works well enough.  Bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine.  Input jack has held up real well so far (amp is about 4 years old now)and the speaker is pretty clean.  My only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough.  I can't practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv.  I suppose a set of headphones would solve this problem- but then its something else I gotta plug in and worry about.  I find that I like the sound of the overdrive better (especially thru my Epi LP) but just can't play it low enough.  I end up having to turn the overdrive off, and then turning the amp up loud and turning the guitar down real low.  If you have issues with volume control in your house- then make sure to get a set of headphones- or else you could suffer the dirty looks, and the banishment I have suffered.  All in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point."
1414,69,3.0,"I bought this gig bag to carry my Fender strat around. I'm just starting to learn guitar so I didn't really know much about my options. I figured I had a Fender guitar so I might as well get a Fender gig bag.Little did I realize how good this one really is. Most gig bags don't come with all these storage pockets. There's plenty of room for a few books, an electronic tuner, string winder, strings, whatever.Padding could always be more, but that's the case with probably any soft-shell bag you buy.All-in-all, I like this bag more and more since I've discovered that all the other options in the price range aren't nearly as good."
732,69,4.0,"I really like the deluxe bags by fender.  Plenty of space for stuff, good straps and carry options and enough padding to provide as much protection as a soft bag can."
590,69,4.0,"The previous reviewer obviously got a defective case. The case I got works incredibly well, and always keeps the guitar well protected, and my back comfortable while carrying it. It has a lot of space, and it looks pretty good too. I'd recommend it to anyone!EDIT* I've had 3 good years with this bag, and it has still yet to rip on me."
140,69,4.0,"I just got this and love it.  My Fender Stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag, padded well too.  I can fit all of my &#34;stuff&#34; into the MANY pockets as well.  This bag is amazing and nothing like what I expected for the price I paid.  It has shoulder straps to carry the bag and contents on my back and also has a large loop to hang the bag on a door or hook too.  If you need a bag to protect your fender and to carry you stuff in, buy this one.  I LOVE IT.  I would expect to pay a hundred bucks for this kind of quality but only spent 30 bucks."
1423,69,4.0,This is an excellent gig bag. Plenty of compartments for all of your accessories. Well padded and has enough carrying options. A good buy.
317,636,4.0,"I have one gig bag already (not like this Fender), and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar I bought.  This Fender is lots better then my other bag.  My other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this Fender bag.  The Finder's padding is a bit better than my other bag also, but, of course, neither is as good as hard case.I am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg.  I need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar, because I use crutches and they require my hands.  The Fender's straps are great.  The left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty-wompass and it became difficult for me to carry.  The straps on this Fender stay put - love it.The guitar I tote in this bag is a Martin HD-28.  But, it can also my Blueridge BR-180 or my Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce.  Either of my three acoustic guitars fit the Fender gig bag perfectly.Like I said, its a great gig bag.  If I ever need another, I'll be getting another Fender gig bag."
349,636,4.0,"Really am impressed with this gig bag. My beloved Jasmine fits perfectly inside, has nice padding, tons of pockets to store stuff, backpack straps and handle for easy carrying, and it looks FAB! Love the price too. Can't go wrong with this one."
468,636,4.0,"I was at Guitar Center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased Ibanez EW20ASENT Acoustic Guitar, which is virtually identical to theIbanez EW20ZWENT Exotic Woods Series Zebrawood Acoustic Electric Cutaway Guitar, but everything they had in stock was a bit too small... I've been playing electric for many years, but this was my first acoustic purchase. Turns out I have the ""Dreadnought"" variety, which is a bit larger. This Fender bag received some great reviews, but I was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren't correct... I couldn't find ANY info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag, so I took the leap... and I'm so glad I did! Bag is not too snug, not too loose, and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps. Great padding, yet still lightweight. And a great price! And it arrived a day early... sweet. Ibanez EW20 body (not neck) dimensions: W 16"", D 5"", L 20"". Thank you Amazon & Fender!"
357,636,4.0,"Look no further these are great bags.. Well padded, lots of good pockets, does all that it should. Very pleased.."
1034,636,3.0,"I went with this over road runner because of the pouch designs which i like better because they are square. Unfortunately I think the Roadrunner is better quality, thicker material."
721,636,4.0,I was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent!.  I have a Seagull S6 Dreadnought and it fits in this bag like a glove.  The zippers are also very high quality and this bag will last a long time. Another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor. I had to travel in some very cold weather to a friends home and I fully expected to have to retune my guitar... not so... it was still in tune and the cold had no effect during transport due to the insulation of this bag.
140,36,4.0,I bought this one for one of my heavier guitars hoping for some shoulder relief and it does the job.  It's inexpensive and the padding is excellent.  It looks like it will last too.
205,36,3.0,"My new electric guitar isn't particularly comfortable to play while sitting, so I needed a strap.  I've played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable, so I hoped to find a padded strap that didn't break the bank.  This strap fits the bill just fine.  Depending on the angle that your pegs are set, however, you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling.  If your pegs are set at an angle, like on a Strat, this strap will last forever.  If you're on a guitar with a horizontal peg, like a LP, you'll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well.  This will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security.  The padding is OK, but not great - however, it's certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus."
1291,36,2.0,"Mid-level quality. The shoulder strap tends to move while you play. Gets the job done, but not for the serious guitarist."
627,36,4.0,I enjoy using this strap on some of my guitars. Easy to install and remove. 5 stars to the seller and the strap itself
1020,36,4.0,Decent quality for the price.  Fits the acoustic guitar as intended and seems comfortable to the person it was purchased for.
1342,36,3.0,"Bought this strap to provide extra comfort for my young son who has to hold up a relatively heavy electric guitar.  Suggestions to make this better woudl be a slidable padding, and to have the padded area longer."
1364,423,4.0,I paid only $29 and it is small and convenient. I was impressed with the sound.At first I played it with my Line 6 15 watt amp. I didn't like it cause of the squealing. But then I read how you use it and all that. Boy! It worked great.I use it with a Tascam US 100 USB plugin to my computer and I get a good sound for practice.I still like my Line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain. But this is a bargain and small.You can use this with any USB audio interface.If you like AC/DC you would like this. There are different amp sounds you can get.Cheap and convenient I'am not disappointed.My opinion is that it sounds best with a USB guitar audio device such as Tascams US 100.
536,423,4.0,"Great bang for the buck clone of a Tech 21 GT-2. This pedal does not have the build quality of the GT-2 but the controls are identical and it sounds darn good (especially for the pocket change they charge).  I have not done a gut-shot comparison of the two pedals so I can not comment on how close the actual circuits and components are.  The TM300 is more than just a distortion box.  It's more like a preamp.  I find that it does a very convincing mid scooped Twin type of clean as well as a decent Marshall type growl.  I find the Mesa to be the least authentic though it is not an unpleasant distortion by any means- it just doesn't sound like a Mesa imho.  If you are looking for triple rec distortion there are probably better dirt boxes for that.  I actually have the same criticism of my Tech 21 Tri-AC (really excellent pedal!)  The TM300 works well running into an amp and because it can simulate a mic'd cab it can also be run directly into a PA or mixer and bypass the amp completely. This thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well.  It can really breath new life into a mediocre practice amp (or any solid state). It can also be stowed in a bag easily enough so that you don't have to lug a backup amp to gigs.  I find it much more realistic sounding than digital modelers but it doesn't quite 100% replicate the sound and touch sensativity of a tube amp being pushed (they haven't invented that yet in my opinion). It doesn't replace a tube amp for me personally but if you are contemplating running straight into the PA because lugging your amp is impractical this is a no-brainer. Five stars for what it does at this price.  If you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases.  If you make your living doing live performances (or if price is not factored into your decision making) I would advise you to pony up the extra money for the Tech 21 product because their overall build quality is much higher (with regards to the enclosure, switch, knobs, jacks), their customer service is top-shelf and they are engineered/manufactured right in NYC.  I own three Tech 21 pedals and previously owned their Trademark 60 amp and I can attest to the difference in overall build quality between their products and Behringer's.  Sound-wise they are very very similar though and I DO have much love for these inexpensive Behringer pedals.  I own close to a dozen of them and I have not encountered a single malfunction in more than 2 years."
129,423,4.0,"I read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than I do and since most people seemed to like it, I figured I'd give it a try.  I was not disappointed at all.  It gives you great sound for solos.  I've tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that it's quite versatile.  I still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound I want, but I think that's just learning about the effects this box provides."
1118,423,4.0,"Stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal. I read the reviews and decided to give it a chance; how could I lose at this price? I put it in my cart and continued shopping.Guess what...the reviewers weren't lying (except that one guy who gave it a 2..what a BS review)!It arrived today, and I decided to give it a quick workout. I grabbed a small amp (Fender Frontman 15) and plugged in my Strat (with a Seymour Duncan Hotrail at the bridge) and gave it a go. The 'quick workout' turned into an hour long jam session as I got caught up in what this pedal can do. It turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather! With the mic at off X, middle set at Hot, and California and 3/4 gain...this thing just SCREAMS for solos and is very heavy for rhythm. I spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away.The Tweed and Brit settings were great too, as I tweaked a multitude of tones from this beast. I've had Behringer pedals before and even though they were decent (vintage delay, slow motion, compressor, eq), I didn't get excited about them. In fact, I sold the delay and slow mo recently. This pedal however, is going to get some serious use. I'm not crazy about the plastic casing, but it seems sturdy enough. I can't recommend this pedal enough...the reviews were right! You won't be sorry."
904,423,4.0,"Its one great modeler,i like the tweed that old tube sound and mic position on cabinets.I am using this with bass, gives you a really clean treble and distortion if you like also, try it  with bass you will like it.rock on."
586,423,4.0,"I don't have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes, but enough to know when I have a winner. Behringer's TM300 is made from tough plastic. The 3 other Beheringers I have had about a year don't look warn and scarred, and sound as good as the day I got them. The tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones. Fender clean, bright, British crunch and distortion, a hot  Gain and sweet smooth California sound.  I am playing out of a Peavey, but I hear a tweed. Amazing clarity, and worth the $28 and change. You won't be disappointed."
1007,423,4.0,"Good price and sound. Classic behringer plastic housing I haven't had a problem with ever but I don't dog my stuff... Favor this over built in analog drives, nicer crunch and dirt that's flexible. Fair to say real tube is the best, but for analog and practice amps this does put some life in the tone.  Can't say for metal as I'm not so into, but everything else find this fits the bill."
517,423,4.0,"I bought this product for only one reason: I have several amps that are not guitar amps, but stereo or PA-type, clean, high powered , two channels, that I want to use as guitar amps, either as the primary or backup. This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp, and then adds gain, volume control, ""crunch"", whatever, to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps. I don't really care what tube amps it models, or what mic placement, I just want the guitar amp sound and style. I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box, so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage, and the other half to the house PA. I don't think that many people would do this.The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp, and kind of amp you are driving with it, and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving. The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound, but I've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps, home stereo amps, bass amps, and guitar amps, all of which drove PA speakers, bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers, all in the same acoustic space. Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant, sound different: some more like guitar  amps and speakers, some not. As I said, I don't really care about what tube amp is being modeled, only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box. It works for me.I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2, and based on its performance so far, it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do. I would consider getting the GT2 in the future, but for now this product is, for me, the poor man's tube amp."
536,825,4.0,"Folks that like the original Ibanez Tube King will love this pedal.  Sturdier construction than most of Behrenger's other pedals-  The housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid.  Folks talk about how bad the stock tube is, but that has not been my experience.  I may experement with a low gain JJ in the future, but the stock tube is staying put for now.  Maybe I got lucky and they 'hand selected' the right one?  This unit sounds really incredible when it's running into the front end of my EL84 powered tube amp.  The sound is really organic and gritty, with great harmonics and smooth sustain. Sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp (no suprise there).  Still, an improvement from the sterile solid state tone.  Be forewarned - this pedal is gigantic in dimension.  Who cares, so long as it sounds this good??  I'd wanted a vintage Chandler/Butler Tube Driver forever, but now I honestly don't need one.  This pedal gets me there on the cheap!"
61,825,3.0,"The VT999 Vintage Tube Monster has quite quickly become my go-to overdrive pedal, surpassing other OD pedals I've used, including the Digitech Bad Monkey, the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer, the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive, and remarkably, the Fulltone Fulldrive 2 MOSFET.The VT999 has several things going for it --- Tweakable EQ (High/Mid/Low) which allows you to run a full spectrum, from muddy, dirty low OD sounds, even from a single coil, to bright, screaming lead tones with high mids or highs.- Noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to ""squeeze"" the tone for some interesting effects- Wide range gain that gets dirty around 9 o'clock and full-on distortion when crankedNow, for full disclosure sake, I did change out the tube to a JJ Tesla 12AX7, but most people who know tubes will tell you that really, tubes are often hit-or-miss, simply on account of them being analog, heater-based elements. That's part of the fun of tube-based OD. I have played a VT999 that had a great sounding overdrive, but mine didn't have that sound until I put in a new tube. Try it out with the stock tube, and go to a different tube if you don't like it. At least try a new tube before giving up.There are two things that I don't like about the VT999, and I can tell you -- both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone. This pedal got it 100% right with tone after a tube switch. The 2 issues are:- The housing is huge, and if you look inside, it seems like a waste of space. There's a lot of open space with nothing there, and while I can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat, it's a bit overboard.- Compared to the Fulldrive, the lack of a boost switch is really a miss. Especially given the large enclosure, it would make perfect sense to move the 5 knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side. That'd take little effort, and given the independent power of this pedal, would be a piece of cake to achieve. Heck, I could probably do it myself, but I don't want to ruin the good sound this produces.Bottom line, I understand that on a pedalboard, real estate is everything. This takes up at least the space of 2 pedals. Is it worth it? To me, it is. I run 2 OD pedals on my 2-row board, and I can honestly say, in the last 10 gigs, I have never gone to the other OD. It's been the Vintage Tube Monster every time."
284,825,4.0,With some trials using different tubes this pedal can add something that is very tough to get otherwise. I run my guitar direct because I don't like amps or having to cart the things around. There are so many shades of tone available that it's tough to really praise this gadget enough especially considering the low cost. I also found using a compresser before it helps. I have a Pigtronix Philosopher's Tone & it made a big differrence. I highly reccomend this tube pre-amp & encourage trying out different tubes to get the sound you want.
884,825,3.0,"It sounds good. Not as a professional tube driver, but quite well for the price. Perfect for begginners and intermediate players that can't afford something else that is a little bit more expensive."
100,825,4.0,This thing is amazing. Like many I cannot afford a tube amp. This transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps I played years ago. Sustain and harmonics are insane. Preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones.The unit is very heavy and rugged. The only component I would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost.
926,825,4.0,"I have a Blue Voodoo all tube amp. It's a dinosaur but has a great tone. Sadly, I tried revamping it with all new tubes, but though it gave me the drive I needed, it also raised the noise level tremendously. This was my last resource before selling an amp I did not want to part with. I thought this pedal would do the trick. I was right. You would think with just one AX7 tube you would get just so much drive, but this puppy gives more than expected. Behringer used to be known as junk, but no more."
131,766,3.0,"nice bag ,padding it good ,i just wish the hooks weren't plastic ,, not shore how long they will last,,"
1212,766,4.0,"Purchased for my Epiphone electric guitar... perfect... has a separate area for my sheet music, picks and capo. Nice bag... I REALLY like it!!!!!!!"
793,766,4.0,Everything I would want in a gig bag! A quality bag for a quality instrument. What you see is what you get.
220,766,4.0,"pretty much this is a great case for the price but i would like more padding because i like my guitars to be safe but if you want a better case for protection invest in a hard case. i cant give it a bad review for not enough padding because this guitar has about the same amount of padding as most soft cases. this is also a pretty handsome looking case,if thats what you care about."
1157,766,4.0,"My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case.  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments.  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case.I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch.  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly.  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top.  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps.  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine.  Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars."
1010,181,4.0,"I tune my guitars, ukuleles, cavaquinhos, and piano with various tuners, like the Korg GA-40 or Korg CA-40 or Korg TM-40, and I pair this Korg CM-100 Tuner Clip and the difference is huge.  You no longer have to worry about background noiseI clip it on the headstock of my guitar/uke/cava and it tunes them quite well.  On the piano, I can clip it on any part and it picks up on the tuner.  It works as well as most/all of the clip-on tuners you see on various guitars and ukuleles nowadays, but if you have one of the chromatic tuners that don't directly clip on (like the Intelli IMT series), then this will make it work 100x better (okay, slightly exaggerated) because the ambient noise is not picked up by the tuner's microphone.I give this accessory high marks, and I highly recommend it."
1330,181,4.0,I have a Korg tuner but found that I needed this so it would not pick up sounds in the room and interfere while I was tuning my Dulcimer. Now I just plug this into the tuner and thenclip it onto the headstock of my Dulcimer. Now I can tune my instrument anywhere without picking up background noise.
745,181,2.0,Not as good as the headstock tuner I purchased. I used it a few times. It can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic.  I wouldn't buy another one.
857,181,3.0,"I teach guitar classes at a community college and spend my days in a room full of twangin' 'n strummin' guitars. Human ears and tuners with external mics, including iPhone app tuners, have trouble in such an environment. Why? The cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines.  So I bring an extra beefySeiko Sat800 Durable Style Chromatic Tunerand Korg CM-100L mic to class for students to use. And it works great: clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the Seiko.The Seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years. Unfortunately the CM-100L is not nearly as durable: wires are thin, delicate and prone to breaking. If I was the only one using the CM-100L, it would probably last for many years. But students are rough and can't stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after they're finished (although I ask them not to). The wire gets stressed at the mic clip and/or plug and shorts out. I burn through one or two CM-100L per semester. I found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire (electrical tape is useless).Great product: easy to use and makes tuning in a room full of guitars a snap. Wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables..."
1143,181,3.0,"Bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer. The clip is a bit larger than I expected, but it just fits on to the bridges under the strings. If I had paid more attention to the picture on the site I would have known how large the clip is in relation to the 1/4"" plug.It does it's job, picking up vibrations from the instrument rather than noise from the room. Works well while other things are going on around you. It seems to track 'truer' with this clip than with the internal microphone, meaning it doesn't bob up and down as much. If that holds true for other instruments, I may start using this clip on everything.I saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled Korg. The one I got is labeled, both on the package and on the clip."
372,881,3.0,"This neck plate rides on the body of a Mexico-made Jazz Bass which I acquired second-hand, replacing the blank factory plate. It could be thicker -- it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up. Still, the guitar now sports the old Sixties Fender &#34;F&#34; logo."
1191,881,4.0,I was upgrading all the chrome on a MIM and put this on.  Looks better than the plain one.  Includes the screws.
586,881,4.0,"It is a Fender product, so it is well made. Reasonably priced. It will make any Strat or Tele build shine."
861,881,4.0,"It looks nice on our Fender Blacktop Bass plus the locks, it completely changed the look of the bass, details"
1219,881,4.0,"There was nothing wrong with my original neckplate, but I was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra.  IT was a direct replacement for the original."
1405,881,4.0,"looks and fits great on my start, nothing more I can ask for! my original neckplate was slightly bent in one corner before I replaced it with this one"
321,881,4.0,It looks fine but as other reviewers have pointed out is thinner than the OEM plate that came on the guitar. Some people mentioned putting shims behind it but a better idea might be to cut the ends of the neck screws down by an 1/8th of an inch so that you don't screw the neck screws in too far.  The plate was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon.
1335,881,4.0,"I put this on my Fender Jazz Bass after I bought a new neck for it. This plate work the exact same as the stock plate, but it dresses the bass up a bit. This is not a mod that people will see (like pickup covers), but I like the way it looks when I pick it up to play."
718,881,4.0,Actually arrived in the proper bag and looked great. Had issues before with company but they resolved all issues. I would do business with them again. Thanks for taking care of me. Pleasure doing business with you
671,881,4.0,Never really had to mess much with this item. Its a quality piece of metal with the nice F logo on it. Mounted my cheap Amazon start neck just fine.
363,881,2.0,I bought this new Fender F neck plate to replace the plain one I had on one of my MIM Strats. but at this time I am not sure I like what I have done. It appears a little thinner than the original and just doesn't look as &#34;original&#34;.
534,421,4.0,A must have for the Yamaha PA130. You can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries. That keeps the weight down tremendously and as long as yo have a plug youa re good to go.
700,421,4.0,"Good  power supply for the cheaper Yamaha keyboards. I have never understood why Yamaha keyboards don't come with a power supply? So, I found a suitable power supply for the instrument and works fine. No problems.Don't buy the one from the store, this is cheaper. Be patient and get this one."
4,421,4.0,"I bought this to replace another adapter that came with the Yamaha keyboard I bought at Costco long time ago.The original adapter was bulky and heavy and that's what caused the wires inside to break.Tried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together, but after short use, the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apart.When it is big and heavy, when you unplug it, sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapter.But the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip.This new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and size.It works beautifully the moment I plugged it in.BTW, I am using this NOT on the CP series.  It actually works for the cheaper keyboards too.My CP33 has this identical adapter which I tested on the other cheap keyboard before I bought it.It's great.And shipping was fast."
1027,421,4.0,The Yamaha keyboards that take batteries don't come with an AC power adapter. No problem. I got this the week after Christmas and it works like it came with the keyboard.
30,748,4.0,I am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases.  This is a great pick!  I am using the other 5 and they play very well!
1116,748,4.0,Really cool looking and are nice picks for the $$.  The eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick.  Great deal from amazon - - thanks!!  I will definitely buy more of these in the future!!
201,748,2.0,"a little small for my hands, but the kids that take lessons from me loved them.  Cute idea.  Would like different holiday designs like this."
774,748,4.0,"These picks are pretty cool, fairly stiff despite their thinness. They are also a bit pointier than regular picks, and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality. Nice to try something new, although they are a bit slippery."
787,748,4.0,"I rarely play with one, as I prefer a thin pick and these are more along the lines of medium, but when I do pull one out of my pocket to play, it always gets attention."
906,695,3.0,"It's a button.  It's not fancy, it's silver, it screwed into my ukulele with no problem, and it works very well."
1350,695,4.0,"One of the strap buttons on a guitar I was given as a gift was missing.  I was told that it would need some minor repairs, so all I had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it.This strap button was screwed right in the minute I got it and it worked like a charm.  I put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn't given me any problems."
587,695,4.0,"My Takamine guitar needed a strap button and this button does the job. The quality seems to be good and installation went fine.For those of you who are unsure about drilling a hole into the guitar, I would only recommend drilling into cheaper guitars (Unless you know what your doing, of course)"
208,695,4.0,"very quick shipping, it works perfectly, I was able to screw it in without and pre-drilling as well.  works with multiple straps as well."
65,695,4.0,Nothing that spectacular really! It did it's job. Was easy for my husband to use. Made me able to use a strap on my guitar.
462,695,3.0,In fact it's beautiful and totally functional. The only reason it gets four stars is due to the fact that it doesn't come with a felt washer to protect your instrument and I had to fashion one myself.  I'd buy it again but they should really include a washer.
298,695,3.0,The only thing that would have been nicer and bumped the rating up would be to send a felt pad with the button. I used a rubber washer I had and that worked very well. It was easy to install.
1109,867,4.0,"I've got two other Levy's cotton straps that I picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they're fantastic! I picked one up on Amazon and I was unaware that there was an 'extended length' version and that it was what I had bought before. I suppose it's just easier for theNo big deal though, just an observation worth noting because if  you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases (and you're a big guy like me and/or you play with the guitar/bass around your knees) you may not be getting what you thought.In any case, these are very comfortable (soft edge), they stick on you (as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down), and they last."
45,867,4.0,Wonderful and inexpensive strap. I use these for all my electrics and have had no problems.Well made and easy to adjust.
1358,867,3.0,This strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff. The only issue I have with it is that the ends are not the same size so I could not install my Dunlop Straploks for it. It may just have been the one I got though.
511,867,4.0,"This Levy's Leathers ""2inch Cotton Guitar Strap"" is good looking (in an understated sort of way), very well made, adjustable and extremely comfortable, and works exactly as expected.We bought this for my son as a ""starter"" strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday, but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future!Highly Recommended!CFH"
1105,867,2.0,"Not much to say about a guitar strap... except I had planned to use it on a Simga acoustic without a pin at the neck. I ended up using the strap on my Strat for the acoustic and this one is on the Strat. This one doesn't come with a wrap or tie for the nut so, it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body. If you need to secure one end at the headstock, this is not an option. It is comfortable though."
664,867,3.0,"I bought this intending to use it on my Seagull acoustic but tonight I put it on my Squier Fat Strat instead. after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap -which was about the same price just because it had ""Fender"" embroidered on it- was making my neck.When I put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap.  So I decided to sign in and write this review.This strap is softer and better made than the poly ones.It even comes with a string tie for your acoustic, which you might need.Consider taking my advice: Treat yourself.$15 for a strap -when guitars cost hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars- is not much.Besides, the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe...The only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegs.I use c-type snap-on strap locks but they will no longer fit.Maybe I'll see if the venerable Grolsch strap locks will work.You can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on sale.Update: Too snug for Grolsch strap locks on the Squier also..."
649,867,4.0,Very comfortable strap.  The cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do.  Seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far.
442,867,4.0,This is a perfect strap for my guitar. It's not rough on my neck and is very adjustable. It's very simple and is perfect for me. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
428,867,4.0,"I admit I bought this only because John Frusciante uses a very similar style strap. But he has good taste. This strap is strong and sturdy. Even without strap locks I'm comfortable going crazy on stage. High quality, does not fray, stays on the guitar. Does what you want and need and looks great!"
259,867,2.0,"I like to walk around while I play. It's a hangup of mine. This strap works fine for that. The only thing I've noticed that can be annoying is that strap moves easily across my back so it is very easy to get the guitar out of position (the neck too high or too low). Other than that, it's a good deal for the price. Maybe I just need a shirt with more cling."
1229,867,3.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned. That being said, the strap is fairly soft and pliable, with that almost broken in feel. I was expecting it to be a little stiffer, but I'm glad it isn't. It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine. My guitar is nothing fancy, so I would presume the ""strap locks"" are pretty standard. The fit is really tight at first, so that should be a good thing. I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap, but I didn't.The range of fit seems pretty good to me. I am 6' tall and wear my acoustic up a little high, kind of ""folk style"" I guess. If I want to, I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area. One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather-logo patch on it, while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside. I can't see it marring the guitar at all. It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder. Made in Canada, seems well built and durable. Once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back, and Keith gets to keep his head fashionable. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
1248,867,3.0,Only complaint is that the cameo is not as well done as shown in the picture.  Other than that the strap is of good quality.
1218,359,4.0,This is the most I've ever spent on a guitar strap. But I have to say it's well worth the price. Very comfortable and looks great too!
1117,359,2.0,"I don't play with a guitar below my waist. I am six feet tall. While very well made, wide, comfortable and good looking, this sling was far too short and had to be returned."
185,359,3.0,"**So after reading a couple comments on this review it's obvious that my original review was somewhat irrelevant being that I was using the strap for the wrong application.  According to the first comment and verified from their companies website(which I should have done before buying) the strap is meant for a bass guitar.  Please don't purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass.  Amazon should have clarified in their item description.  Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review.**I'm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short.  I currently own two other leather straps and they have the potential to be lengthened so that my acoustic would hang down by my waist or so, even though I usually play it about midway on my torso.  I don't NEED my straps to be super long but this thing makes it hard to even put the guitar on.  It just feels a little tight and crammed when I wear it.  I'll probably end up adding a string at one end just to give myself an extra 4 inches or so.  The leather itself isn't a bad quality, but it's not the finest.  I'd suggest dropping an extra $20 or so and getting a very high quality strap.**I just wanted to clarify that I was reviewing this product in regards to my acoustic guitar.  I have read some other reviews and it seems that those using it for an electric guitar have no complaints, but being that my acoustic is a good 2-3 times as thick as an electric, it does not serve my needs."
1140,359,4.0,"I used to have a regular guitar strap on my bass, but when I got a regular weekly bass gig and was using it more often, it started to feel like the strap was digging into my shoulder. Your mileage may vary on that, but I decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bass.I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one -- some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable, but this one was usually reviewed well. It was the perfect choice. This strap needs no wearing-in -- it's supple and soft right out of the box. The leather on top is smooth and classy looking, and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft, with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder. The wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better, and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps. All of this adds up to a great deal of comfort.I use Dunlop strap locks on my instruments, and with a thicker strap like this, I had some concerns about getting them on there, but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap, no problem.I would highly recommend this strap for any bass player, or even someone with an especially heavy guitar."
1344,359,2.0,"I bought this because someone told me they really liked it...but it's just not a good product...for me anyways.I bought this to help disperse some of the weight of my Les Paul on my shoulder.  The problem is, the thick part of this strap is made too short so if I bring the neck of the guitar up to my shoulder at all, the weight of the guitar is now on the skinny part of the strap.The leather feels a bit cheap as well...you get what you pay for.I guess the strap is ok if you play with the guitar in one position...yippeee!I'll probably have to break-down and pay $100 for a real strap."
51,359,4.0,"Straps don't get any better than this.  Super leather, very well put-together.  Perhaps a bit wide, but i play short sets.  For the gigging pro, I think the width is an advantage in spreading out the weight.  excellent, just excellent."
1081,252,4.0,"This thing is really comfortable, holds the weight of my les paul nicely. Its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better, I can play for 2+ hours and my shoulders feel fine! I feed the narrow end through 3 of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good. Well made, feels very strong.  Texture is very nice, doesnt slip.  Overall a very good product."
388,252,4.0,"I usually don't buy many guitar straps, and when I do, I like to get a thick, leather-type one, because I've found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while, and I don't like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments.  I bought the black version; I think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over, so I probably won't worry about running colors (but I will keep an eye out for such a thing).  It's very adjustable (just not quickly adjustable), worked perfectly with my Straplocks, and keeps my 45 pound (it seems like it, anyway) Les Paul from digging into my shoulder.  The 2.5 inch width is fine for me, but if you're spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster, I'd go up to the 3 inch model, especially if you're going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours."
1204,252,3.0,"this strap works fine on my Fender Strat.  it is reasonably comfortable.  I was disappointed in that it does not fit the pegs of my Zager acoustic.  otherwise,  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap."
148,252,4.0,"This is an excellent strap.This particular strap replaces a 2 inch wide model that I've had for at least 10 years.  That is a great strap and has held up wonderfully.  I fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability.So why the new strap?* By not using strap locks the area around the strap button holes is much looser than a new one would be.  Since I recently bought a new guitar I wanted a more secure strap without going fully to strap locks. So far so good.* Wider.  I wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference.  Boy does it ever, the new 2.5 strap is really much more comfortable than my old 2 inch model.  It isn't a miracle, but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb Les Paul.A consideration: This is suede and will fuzz for the first little while.  If that is an issue for you I would avoid this suede strap, and probably suede in general.  After these strap break in though they are very soft and supple.Highly recommended for confort and durability."
1086,252,4.0,"What a nice strap! It's a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnought.The whole strap is leather--no adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument. It took me a little while to get used to this method, but now I don't even think of it. The main strap has several slots cut into it, and there's another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place. It's simple and very secure. It makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain, but how often do you adjust your strap length once you've gotten it set? I almost never do.It's an affordable strap that looks elegant, is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar, has great length adjustment range, and rolls up to fit in the case. I had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitar--I have a pickup system installed, and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button. Ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly. I would buy it again."
1040,252,2.0,"Got the black one.  Bought this to help hold up my heavy Sheraton II and needed something at least 2 inches wide and strong to do it.  On that level this strap succeeds. It is definitely strong enough to keep my guitar from falling off or shifting on my shoulder.  It also looks very nice.But any positive thoughts I have about it are outweighed by the constant shedding of black dyed leather that continually falls off the strap and onto me, my guitar, my carpets, etc.I need things like guitar straps to be ready to USE without causing a shower of little leather bits all over the place!  I am not sure how long this will go on but I've been using it for two weeks now and there is a trail of small black leather wherever I go.  I have not encountered the dye running yet.Honestly if I had it to do over, I would skip this particular strap. Suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment."
238,252,4.0,"This is my second black suede leather strap I've bought from Levy's.  I love them.  The 2.5&#34; is wide and comfy.  The strap is soft.  I have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart.  They're high quality.  And they offer plenty of length adjustments, without any buckles or metal of any kind."
1385,252,4.0,Nice strap. Very comfortable. Doesn't cut into your body at any point. Easy to adjust. Worth the price. Would definitely buy another.
441,252,4.0,"For players that want a high quality guitar strap that weighs almost nothing, last forever, stays in place, and has classic good looks there is not a better strap than Levy's natural leather, suede strap (without the piping and stiched edge). The dying of the suede side is deep and flawless and the strap is a quality piece of hide without bulk or unnecessary weight from padding.  Feels great to the touch and you quickly forget that its even touching your shoulder. It can be a little bit of a chore to get strap locks on, but once on I have never had any worries or failures so that my guitars are nick and ding free. Plenty of color choices.  This is a simple, elegant strap that inspires envy.  Planet wave has a nice strap that is the only one I've seen (and owned) that even comes close, but  there is no other suede strap that is even in the same ball park as the Levy MS26.  I own 4 and they are admired by everyone who sees them and slips them over their shoulder.  It could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps... It did for me."
240,252,2.0,A bit too soft but given the fact it does say made of suede you should expect it to be super soft.  Better for lighter guitars IMO
1163,252,4.0,"Price is great. Works perfect. Comfortable, and looks sharp. Not the least bit stiff like some leather products. My first experience with Levy, and completely satisfied. Thank you. Wayne"
761,12,4.0,"Gorgeous strapped to my son's Martin acoustic guitar. He loves it. It's pretty without distracting from the guitar itself. VERY well made and durable. I've even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water. The leather is a bit stiff, but it broke in in no time. This will last a very long time."
95,12,2.0,"This strap is really beautiful. The Native American pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar I made with the images of wolves burned into the top. However, the leather ends are very thick and stiff, making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar. I tried to put the snap-on strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an Exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them. I have a nice Ralph Marlin strap with soft, pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort - workable with one hand. I'd give this Levy's strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible."
1163,12,4.0,"Just a great strap. A straight up product well worth the money. Man, it's good to buy something from someone who puts their name, labor, and product on the line. Then delivers! Here it is..you want it, come get it. Can't miss dealing like that. Thank you."
1307,510,4.0,"I have been using those webbed, nylon & sometimes cutting straps for years 'cause they were inexpensive (but not cheap). Don't know why I waited so long. Quality in this baby! ... comfortable too!"
132,510,4.0,"This is a well made guitar strap, and is exactly as described. Suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather, and 2 inches is fairly narrow. If this is what you want, then this guitar strap is perfect. If you prefer the strap slip easily, or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more, then it won't be.Definitely top notch if this is what you are after though. 5-stars."
788,510,2.0,"First the goods: Sturdy leather construction just cant be beat. the color is spot on with the pictures shown.The Bads: It's a bit short, I have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the &#34;shoe lace around the head stock&#34; method, I had to max this strap out to make the span. I'm a bigger guy, so a smaller person shouldn't have this problem. Then there's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadn't considered. It drags and pulls your shirt really bad, making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang. That problem is not specific to this strap, but the material its made out of. It's high quality, but I didn't consider it trying to pull my shirt off. If had to do over again, I'd pass."
1163,510,4.0,"Sweet suede. The feel of suede is hard to beat. This strap fits right, feels good, and looks handsome. Levy's is dependable, reliable. What more? Thank you."
68,510,4.0,I bought this strap for my Luna 12 string.  The strap is very comfortable and durable which is exactly what I needed.
1235,510,4.0,"The width is nice, wide enough to distribute the weight, but not too wide.  Attaching it is a snap.  The suede gives it a nice 'grip' to your shoulder so the guitar doesn't slide around."
1093,659,4.0,"Looks great, feels great, and works great! The leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely. great! I love it!"
271,659,4.0,"Width and padding are good for Heavier guitar (currently being used on a Les Paul). Finish, stitching, and adjustments are quality.The only issue I had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegs.You might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in place...But that means the guitar is very secure, so I am very happy."
12,659,4.0,"Study strap. Great feel, leather matches my instrument well. 2-1/2&#34; width worked well for me compared to the 4&#34; version."
907,659,4.0,Heavy construction in layered leather.There is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking.I will buy another in a second color.
240,659,4.0,This is hands down the most comfortable strap I own.  I am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but I use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable.  Not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model.  Worth the wait.
1281,659,3.0,"If you are playing a guitar that costs several hundreds to several thousand dollars, why would anyone buy a cheap guitar strap to hold it up. I have friends who think strap-locks are the best invention of the century but, I believe in buying a quality guitar strap & Levy's produces some of the best on the market. I own several acoustic & electric guitars... for the most part, I have a strap for each one except the pieces too valuable to take to a gig. Every strap is a Levy's...I'll call myself a veteran pro guitarist (I don't believe in using the word ""old"") who gigs about 12 - 15 days a month. This strap is comfortable to wear & strong enough to hold up my Gibson Les Paul Standard without any worries of dropping it. I've watched friends & band-mates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps... I offer my advise to buy a quality strap & find most continue to use crap straps. BUY IT... You will love it!"
941,128,4.0,Ordered this and two cables! This came and it is so sleek and pretty and the xlr cables fit in it well but the button to turn on the phantom power is a little loose but other than that it is a wonderful little unit! I recommend!
217,128,4.0,"Delivery was Amazon fast, installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music.  It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months, and we expect it to continue for years.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Mic sound is pristine, no noise, we use it for vocal recording in studio, run it off an M-Audio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power.  Top Recommendation."
1050,128,4.0,"Phantom power supplies aren't very sexy items, but they're extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones. This Nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm. Totally no-frills, rock solid metal construction and you can't hear it at all."
571,128,4.0,"Does what it says with no whining whatsoever, really quiet producing absolutely no audible hum. Very small footprint, too! Would I recommend it? Yes. I would."
1207,135,0.0,"I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but I got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. It's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends. Soooo it's pretty much useless to me. I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point. I would've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. I think I payed like $8 for it so whatever. I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end."
1093,135,0.0,"I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 Spot&#34; brand plug. It is not what I received. Instead I received a generic plug  for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one. In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. I emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. I can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. I strongly recommend, spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug."
306,135,4.0,"This is the cheapest and most effective way of saving a lot of money in wasted 9v batteries that will always run out on a gig, rather than when it doesn't matter. Linked to the power supply - which is still cheaper than any of the 9v ones supplied by the manufacturer."
274,135,4.0,This cable expands the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V adapter. The quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards.
487,135,4.0,"After reading a bunch of reviews about this product, i was not sure about buying it , but i give it a try and i am completely satisfy, it doesn't ad noise to my pedal chain, i use it with a radioshack power supply 9v 2.5 A , and a can tell that not a sound came from electric issues.I'm not saying that it is better than a voodoo lab power brick , but for me work perfect and i don't see why not taking it out for Gigs."
611,135,4.0,"I have 2 one spots which came with the 5 multi plug cable, after reading a little bit on the internet I read that the one spots can handle almost 10 pedals each (depends on the pedal, power handling etc.) So I saw they had an 8 plug cable and figured I would try it out. With adding many more pedals to my board, this is perfect. Def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once."
268,135,4.0,nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy peppy perky free i do i do i do
345,730,3.0,"This is one of many Behringer pedals that offer a unique, stand-alone sound. The chorus effects are well known, and even included on many amps, and featured on almost every multi-effects pedal. I like the individual pedals because I can add in just what I want instead of relying on someone else's idea in a pre-set. This Chorus is just about right. It has a range of sounds for different situations, and is very reliable and well made. There is no problem with the B. tough plastic cases. If you want a metal housing, it's for some sentimental reason, thinking that metal is automatically better or more durable than plastic. You just need to push the off on switch, not bat baseballs."
969,730,2.0,The chorus effect is a little weak. I use it now to get sort of a leslie effect. Clean the effect is a little weak. The adjustment knobs don't seem to do much either.
508,730,2.0,"First let me say im using this for a BASS (at least for this review) and nothing else. That said I LOVEBehringer products that I own. This guy was really cheap and actually the ""chorus"" part is weak...as comparedwith other chorus' I have such as (ART,ZOOM,PEAVEY,LINE-6,Gibson) Or we could say in a more positive phrase""very subtle"" . The ""stereo"" effect for me was non-existant BUT realize I bought this item over buying a normalABY switch. Doing so saved me a bundle but in the long run I will pay for it. There is a high cycle hum in the background(which almost ALL chorus units end up having). But I can say it did the job as far as splitting a signal into 2 amplifierheads and doesnt seem to have a problem with the signal being delivered. *note* if you plan on using a 9volt dc adapteryou have laying around in yer gear/scrap bucket think again----wont work ...I tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail.all that said I still gota give the item its due.Negatives: the unit is made out of plastic and you will have to take it easy when engaging on/off. I had to take mine apart becausethe ""chorus"" wouldnt trigger ""on"" . It was due to the fact it just has a small strip of rubber that is supposed to engage with the buttonswitch on the electronics board . you may have to put something behind it or replace it."
953,730,4.0,"I love this pedal! That said I would like to address some of the reviews I see on here. I have been playing guitar since I was 14 years old. I am now 57 so I have a few years of experience. First you guys who complain about the plastic housing. Are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals? If you are stop doing it. All you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works. The plastic housing is extremely strong and won't bust when used properly. The next thing I would like to address is the battery running down &#34;even when it's turned off&#34;. Every effects pedal I ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it. Get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain. It will save you a fortune. The ones saying the sound sucked, buy something besides a $50 amp, and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain. Thi is a good pedal and I've used it on stage for 2 years without a problem. That means I have spent about $11 a year for a pedal that has earned me Thousands! Buy one, learn how to use it and you'll be happy."
1305,730,3.0,"hey rockers!!!  DON'T HESITATE BUY IT bEHRINGER IS A GREAT EFFECT IT IS MADE IN GERMANY ,, THAT SHOULD EXPLAIN ITS ENGINEERING ,, THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IS PLASTIC,, BUT DON'T LET THAT FULL UR EAR!!! THE effects put out same as some of the older brands ,,, i trust Behringer , i get more in tone and sound then what i payed for 100%,,,, this chorus is a wonderful effect and has a lot of color to the tone this effect is made well with thought behind it ,, and versatility as well... i say buy it. iv been using all kinds of brand effects ,, and at the end of the day like everything else you pay for the name,, and some times what u get may not value its name ,, that's why behringer proves that with its effects .."
1048,730,4.0,I like Behringer pedals so I may be bias but this pedal really adds to my sound. I really helps with pick up
631,341,4.0,"For the money (CHEAP!), this is worth getting. The loop feature is quite good, the delay/echo entirely satisfactory. Not as good as, say, a BOSS unit, but they cost 5x as much. Great for everything from slapback to long delay, with heap-big repeats available. The plastic housing might not stand-up to the road. Having the 9v adapter input on the side behind the in jack, rather than the back, seems wise. I've read some negative press about Behringer pedals, but personally cannot complain."
536,341,4.0,"Pretty much a straight up clone of the Boss pedal- and a decent one at that. Not the bulletproof construction of the boss to be sure, but all the functions are the same. This is not true bypass but neither is the Boss. I have not experienced the tone-suck or buzzing that others have complained about. Mine worked flawlessly out of the box and does a great job thickening up my leads in a Gilmour or EJ way. Is this the best digital delay on the market? Surely not, but it's the best cheap one. The pedal features up to 2 seconds of delay and a tap tempo function, however the instructions do not tell you how to engage the tap function(hold the pedal down). Believe me, you figure it out at this price point. If you want to spend double the price ($70- still cheap for a delay~), I would suggest the Ibanez DE7. Incidentally- this pedal- like any other digital delay or digital reverb- will EAT batteries. It's what they do, and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal. Invest in a daisy chain (SPOT or the like...) If you have a pedal train with multiple stomp boxes and you are running them via 9 volt it's a no-brainer."
1030,341,4.0,"for the price and options u can not beat this pedal, i just sound great with acoustic or electric guitar. thank u guys your pedals really kick butt!"
468,341,4.0,"I bought this for occasional use with a guitar, mostly it collected dust. But...Sometimes I play guitar in a band where I mix from the stage, and the vocalist likes a little slappy echo on his voice, but between songs he likes the delay off... so I figured an experiment was in order.I ran 2 20' cables, one from the aux out on my board to the delay input, the other from the delay output to an open channel on my board. I turned the level to ""max"", and dialed the really wet signal into the monitors and FOH. I let him kick that pedal on and off all night... now I can concentrate on playing and not on whether I forgot to mute/unmute his stupid delay. Win! And it sounds pretty darned good, I shaved a little treble off the channel so it didn't get too ""in the way"", almost like an analog quality. Good stuff."
463,341,4.0,"i don't know much about delay and I've never really used it. This is a fun pedal, for a simple cool delay. Kinda makes you aware of what you are playing. Fun with blues/chorus sound! Yep!"
1305,341,3.0,"well Behringer!!!,, have to say that the electronics are german mind,, with all that says ,, go figure it out for yourself,, other then that !!.. plastic so i give 4 stars, cuz of the soft plastic case, and the trouble of changing batteries,, but u can use the charger and u will be well off.. sound is really awesome for the money , and it is high standard delay time and sound,, i don't think u can get the german quality anywhere else for 30 bucks,, i say buy it it is a great delay pedal,, and not only the delay most all Behringer effects are sounding great for the money,, can not go wrong.."
1091,341,2.0,"This Behringer DD400 delay unit has a lot of great features. I particularly like the stereo outputs which allow the user to send the delayed signal to a separate amplifier for a dramatic stereo effect. The extra-long 1300 millisecond delay is great for Pink Floyd/David Gilmour style solos. The shorter delay settings allow for rockabilly slap back effects, although I hardly ever play in that style, so it doesn't matter that much to me.Here's where it gets weird: I tested the unit using a vintage Fender tube amp for the primary signal and a Vox Valvestate amp for the delayed signal. As long as I played loudly, everything worked quite well. However, when I set the guitar down for a moment, I started hearing voices. Yes, voices! The delay unit was picking up radio frequency interference a la Jimi Hendrix at Berkeley. I have no idea HOW it was doing this, but I could clearly hear some sort of radio transmission like CB or family band radio. The interference went away after a few minutes.As for design, I don't buy the ""German innovation"" advertising line from Behringer. This is obviously a cheap Chinese copy of the legendary Boss DD-7 which costs four times as much. If you want really good quality, buy the Boss unit! If you can get buy on a fairly cheap delay unit that talks to you from time to time, the Behringer is ok."
772,341,4.0,as usual another good piece of equiptmentfrom behringer I not only use it for my guitars but also on my keyboardmakes real good sound  very adaptable again will buy more of their products as usual most of my purchases on amazon were quality stuff at good prices very efficient and fast delivery times
1158,341,3.0,If you want U2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound. Thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob. For the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget.
1238,341,3.0,"i originally wanted the Boss DD, but after doing a side by side demo, i decided that i'm not Buckethead and don't need a 150 dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then. I have the Berhinger Reverb Machine and HellBabe and they do equal if not.....no they do equal to my Boss counterparts. Especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isn't stock Boss. i wouldn't take these on the road or anything without 3 or 4 backups, but for recording and doing demos Behinger is the way to go, timed effects wise anyway. they are made of plastic after all."
1082,341,3.0,"This Behringer unit has all the necessary features to give you solid performance in a stompbox delay pedal.  I say, why pay more?"
681,418,4.0,"This issue with this bad boy is not quality, features, or design. This is a Pedaltrain product, and just like my Pedaltrain 2, this is a well-made, perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do -it holds 50 freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff. And that, my friends is the problem.I am using a Voodoo Labs 4x4 power supply, but had to also get a Tripplite Isobar, 6 outlet power strip that I drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals. I plug that into the wall and then use a homemade 8&#34; iec power plug in the Voodoo. On the pedal I was able to fit 2 Jim Dunlop volume pedals (one is for the looper), a Crybaby Wah, TC Electronic Flashback X4, Sparkbooster, Mojo mojo overdrive, Corona chorus, Hall of Fame Reverb, Ditto looper, and the Shaker vibrato. I also have the MXR flanger, Helicon Harmony pedal for vocals, a Korg tuner and an Electro Harmonix Pulsar tremolo.(I know, I know.)Did I mention this sucker is big? I feel like they should name it the &#34;pedal porch&#34;. Maybe I can put a few potted plants on it.So getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth, I will ask you, to ask yourself, &#34;Do I really need all these pedals? If the answer is &#34;Hell yes, I deserve them all! I worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds!!&#34;, then by all means knock yourself out. Just don't get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space. No joke."
426,418,4.0,"This is simply one of the best pedal boards out there. It is very well made, resistant, tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape. Looks good too. I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial' velcro included, especially if you have a combination of both regular size (MXR or Boss) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb. If thinking of purchasing one of these, you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals, so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized. Now, if you are on the road for long, I would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case. For eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok."
91,418,4.0,"I've owned a couple of Pedaltrain pedal boards. First the PT-2 and now the Pro. I use this to house a Line6 M13, M9, a Korg Pitchblack tuner, Clyde Deluxe Wah and a Boss channel switch. There's plenty of pedal board real estate for all of this and the soft case is incredibly strong and durable. You can imagine my board being VERY heavy, and it is, but the soft case does a great job. The included Velcro keeps the incredibly heavy M9 and M13 securely in place even when I store the pedal board upright/on edge between weekly gigs. There's also a lot of places to use zip ties to clean up your rig. Also comes with a great little bracket that will house the Voodoo Lab and possibly some other pedal power supplies. Pedaltrain makes a great pedal board."
1331,418,3.0,"..is all I can say. I got the unit, opened up the softcase and pulled out the nice black powder coated aluminum pedal board and...WOW there is a lot of space on this thing. Do I think the price is fair for a piece of welded aluminum and what is basically a re-branded 'Gator' nylon bag. No. Its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro. However, when I factor in the laziness of not wanting to build my own board, suddenly one hundred fifty bucks seems like a decent trade. I was a littel disappointed to see the cheap-o rubber feet, my guess is they will be missing in about 6 months but, I have learned to fix those. Specifically the product is solid as welded aluminum should be and the soft case feels rugged...we'll see. Again, my only gripe is with the price considering there is no other mounting system other than velcro, at least that comes with it, and no intergrated power supply. However, if you need a lot of pedal space (read the dimensions!) and the heft of welded aluminum, this may be the last pedal board you buy. Did I mention this thing is freggin' huge? Minus one star for a little price gouging..."
738,60,4.0,"I love this capo. Let me tell you about my capo journey where I've used every brand while searching for this one. First, I always owned the old Dunlop Toggle Action capo which is just old tech, you know, where it's just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber, the kind one used to use before 1980. I had to go back to that when my first Planet Waves black THERMOPLASTIC capo broke. Don't buy those if you live in a damp climate like CA. Each one I bought broke, one broke within a week, during the winter rainy days. So I loved those capos, they were perfect, but I was done with the breaking, so I figured I'd try others instead despite my love for the Planet Waves design (I didn't know about the silver aluminum one yet). Well, I hated each other one I tried. Kyser, if you have had carpal and/or are small handed, you know what I mean, you don't want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don't want to play the guitar. I really hate the Kysers (I know some folks love to squeeze and use them, that's fine, different strokes right). Then I tried the Schub, you have to be kidding me. OMG that thing is so ridiculous, it pops off, it wiggles about, it is tricky, I hate it. Now, I know many folks are Schub fans who give me a drive by downrate, I'm not saying it isn't great for those who love it. If you love the Schub, you love it unconditionally, and I respect that, all I'm saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me. There are other models that fail similarly to these 2, they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands, like the G7, I did fall in love with it until maybe the 5th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on. Awk~ward and painful. Sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby, but if you have carpal, you know what I mean, you want to go easy on the hands and arms, and not brutalize them. The other thing I've always hated about the Kysers (and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved) is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder. That's just dumb. Kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don't mind it or claim it doesn't do that, but you know what I'm talking about. Ok, so then because of all the broken Planet Waves thermoplastic capos, I turned next to Dunlop's turnscrew models. I liked them, they are very similar to the PW design, but the screw location is more awkward to use, and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers (got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it). So, I turned back in search for a better Planet Waves model. This is it, right here. The silver one is excellent, and it's made of aluminum, not thermoplastic. I bought one and it has lasted me almost 3 years now without a single problem. By now, in contrast, I would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones. I want to say that if you are performing in a public venue, never use the thermoplastic ones, because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room, and could easily ""poke someone's eyes out"". Not kidding, don't use those in public situations. Back to the excellent aluminum silver PWaves capo. I love it, because it doesn't break, not at all, and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever (especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc). The great features are:1. Ease of use and easy fitting are perfect, the best of all capos. This capo fits so easily. Simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect-- you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches, unlike the other screwtops or all other capos, there's no need for any moving around, adjusting the guitar, falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar, sheesh none of that nonsense. You put it on and they've engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on, move it from fret to fret, put it where you want, and screw it in with great ease! Wow, best ever in this category. Ease of use is tops, ever!2. It will never hurt you, it only helps. It weighs nothing, is easy to carry, you can slip it onto the peg area, it just is so light. I still can't believe how light it feels.3. It does what it's supposed to, that other capos don't do. No issues with being in tune, just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire, no wrestling around like some capos do. The screw is in the most easy location, and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn't hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew, it's a breeze. No problems with the size, it's so small, it doesn't get in your way on the fretboard. You won't have to do hand yoga in order to play capo'd songs, it is FLAT (I know, what a concept!). A capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords, not pretzeled twister instead of chords. Now, I play capo'd songs all the time because of this capo, and it is so much fun musically, a whole new magical experience. The truth I've found is that good equipment matters in music making (I never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until I got my first Applause guitar with great action. I have a Yamaha I love now (since the Applause necks break), but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that's easy to use (in the case of guitars, great action is imperative. In the case of capos, ease of use and no pain produced is imperative, and it opens up the world of capo use, the magic of the mathematics of music theory.)If you love the other brands, don't diss me, I know it's perfect for you, and I'm happy for you that it works perfectly for you, because when you have the best one for you, you will shine with your music and I will enjoy listening to you play. But those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what I'm talking about, you won't settle for the torture of Kysers and Schubs, gotta be kidding me. I bought every capo imaginable (need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile) but ended up that I was using the old toggle type again instead until I found the aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo. Planet Waves has made the perfect capo now, no more issues, just easy fun playing capo'd songs. Again, only buy the Silver model, because when/if you get silver, you are guaranteed to get aluminum, not thermoplastic."
1385,60,3.0,Not as good as the G7th line of Capo but they are about half the price. I bought this for a 12 string Jumbo acoustic guitar and I was thrilled with the way it sounded. So I will probably be using it on my electrics. But like I said it good for the price.
322,60,4.0,The capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard.  What I like most is that the padded arm is thin and keeps out of the way of your playing.  Highly recommended!
1053,60,3.0,"I've had this for about 2 weeks now and this capo is simple and works great. It feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well. If you know how much pressure to apply to the frets, the capo works great though I always have to do a bit of fine tuning, as was expected in the first place. I love how cheap it was compared to the other capos, and yes it's not made of plastic."
356,616,3.0,I just got it and tried it out. It's not great but should work as a quiet practice amp.  You have to diddle with the gain and volume controls to get an almost realistic sound.  I would recommend this to anyone.
521,616,1.0,"I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. Generously, I'll give it 2stars. Something like this really should last at least a year or more. Cheap parts/manufacturing?  50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature."
896,616,1.0,Sound is not so good. Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything.
398,616,1.0,"I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans.."
186,616,1.0,"As an amateur musician, I'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such.  I thought this gadget would do the trick, but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations."
839,616,4.0,"I'm a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play. I however, am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp. My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want, with as much clarity or with all the &#34;smoke&#34; as I feel like dialing in for now. It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in, put in my ear buds, and practice for a while anywhere I want, anytime I want. Downside: I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are small/hard to read but easy to learn. You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time. Solution: Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive. I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun. This was a good choice. Buy one!"
1157,616,4.0,"I bought the Vox Amplug AC30 and loved it so much, it probably doubled (or tripled) the amount of time I play guitar.  I loved it so much I went out and got the more expensive (by $10) Joe Satriani Signature Amplug.  I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30, and delay feature is a lot of fun.  But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug.  Why did have only a 4-star review on Amazon - among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products.  Would it be only a ""one trick pony""?Well, I have to tell you, I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is, and I'm now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews.  I've tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier, and many pedal users are seeking what they call a ""Marshall-in-a-box"".  In other words, they want a effects pedal that will single-handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls.  Believe it or not, the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a ""Marshall"" sound as I can imagine.  And it comes in a small, plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of $39.99.Functionally, the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 - three dials for gain, tone, and volume, an aux in jack (for MP3 players), a headphone jack, and an on/off switch.  But that's where the similarities end.  While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy, sparkly sound of a tube amplifier, the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH.  The low end presence on this thing (even through a $20 set of entry-level Sony headphones from Target) is significantly greater than on the AC30.  More importantly, the sound doesn't deteriorate with higher volumes.  There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones, but most of them become a static-filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume.  Amazingly, the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the ""overdrive"" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity.But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob.  Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak, or claimed that there were no clean tones.  Yet, with both my Les Paul and a Strat, I was able to set the Volume at around 6-8 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume.  If any dirt was remaining, a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem.  Even better, playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamer-like blues tone!  This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Vox's website, but I didn't believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that tone.Long story short, the Classic Rock is extremely powerful, but more verstaile than I thought.  It can do the high-gain Marshall tones I expected, but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly-overdriven tones.  It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug, though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30.  The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both.  Highly recommend the Classic Rock - 5 stars."
1372,289,4.0,I love these cables. I ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs. They are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day
370,289,4.0,I prefer woven cables for looks. They have a nice stage presence. Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables. I don't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer. This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that's OK for me and I'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage.
13,289,2.0,"nice cable, could be a little heavier.  I managed to pull the wires apart on the straight plug, probably stepped on the cord when I was playing guitar while standing.  I had to take it apart and resolder but it has been really good since."
1029,289,4.0,this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable I don't have problems with it tangling like I saw on one review
538,289,1.0,Bought this years ago. It was a nice long cable that I bought figuring it'd be durable but it didn't last. Maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig... If I was better with wiring I'm sure it's fixable but all in all it didn't last as long as I'd hoped.
296,289,3.0,"I needed this for my Jazzmaster that has a front face input.  Sounds fine, although that guitar is notably &#34;humm-y&#34; with the single coils, I don't feel this cable added any more noise in the line.  Looks cool and sounds good to me and great price, I actually bought 2 !!!"
1206,289,4.0,I've been using HOSA cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced. I particularly like the right angle plug. It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars. That's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar. This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it.
110,289,1.0,Cable crackles when plug in jack is moved. GLS brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison. Both have tweed jackets however the Hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the GLS cable does. I would recommend the GLS product over the Hosa product.
105,289,4.0,"I like it, got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use.  Thanks for getting it to me so fast, and I recommend going through the vendor I received this from it works great."
783,289,4.0,"I've used Hosa for years, they have never let me down. All their cords are quit and are quality produces. I have never had a Hosa go bad on me."
288,289,4.0,"I like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere. I use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar. The right angle is nice because it's low profile and fits perfectly on my board, even when I put it in it's travel case. Everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem."
250,289,3.0,"It doesn't twist up like my standard black cable does, but it will twist a bit over time. Love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn't just stick right out there. If you really want to avoid on-stage kinks, then you MUST go wireless, it is the ONLY way to avoids twisted cables - no matter what type you buy. This cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion. It's worth spending a Jackson, IMO."
1202,289,0.0,"the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package.  save your money and buy a better cable.  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective.  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else."
1269,494,4.0,Hands down the best cable I have ever owned. I was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now I spend that money on other stuff. I play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for 3 or 4 months. Well worth the money. Lifetime guarantee to boot. Definitely will buy Mogami from now on.
1309,494,4.0,"Yes, you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of Mogami gold quality. I found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound. Compared to my old cable, the Mogami Gold produced a more transparent sound... you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea. When recording guitar, I am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords. No matter your playing style, this cable will work well with your sound."
707,494,4.0,"What is there to say. If you're looking at this cable, then you must have some knowledge of tone loss. Simple, if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal, buy Mogami. I have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches Mogami. Sure you can buy the expensive Analysis Plus Pro and Evidence Audio cables. But you will NOT hear a difference. Lifetime warranty and you won't be replacing it any time soon. Works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio. All I own are Mogami cables. Check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord. Goodbye pops and noise."
1193,303,3.0,"...but it works fine for me.I used to connect a Orange Micro Terror Head AmpOrange Amplifiers Micro Terror MT20 20W Hybrid Guitar Amp Head (Standard)to a cabinet PPC108Orange PPC108 1x8"" Speaker Cabinet"
681,303,4.0,Bought several of these and they worked fine. I later moved on to Planet Waves for my custom pedal board because I could get the lengths perfect.
1184,303,4.0,This cable is built to last. Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly. What more could you ask for
360,303,4.0,"As it is with most things in life, you get what you pay for and while this Hosa effects-connecting cable isn't the best quality cable that is out there e.g. Zaolla, Evidence etc it certainly does the job it's supposed to at a reasonable price.  Too few guitarists, and I was one of them for many years until recently, pay enough attention to the quality of their cables and hence spend too much time on the amps, the pick ups, strings etc.  I discovered way too late how important investing in high quality cables is to your sound but I guess better late than never.  However, if you are on a budget and you are looking for effects-connecting cables that do a job for a good price then these Hosa ones will do a good enough job.  For me, after much experimentation I have foundZaolla ZGTR-110 Guitar Cableto be the best for my sound and while they are not cheap they are certainly quality and worth the money for the improved sound they provide.These Hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended."
1065,303,3.0,"Without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my 7-pedal guitar effect lineup.No noticeable hiss, hum or buzzing. Clean & quiet.Good buy for the price."
1356,303,4.0,It's a cable.  It works great.  I don't see any reason to spend more money on a short cable like this.
330,303,4.0,"These are great patch cables. They make a strong connection between pedals and don't sacrifice any sound quality. I've been using many of these, every day, for quite a while and they are still working great."
739,303,4.0,"It's well make and cheap compare with other product on Amazon nowadays market. I.I do replace it for guitar cable, work fine, I'm happy with this unit. Recommend to someone need replace cable jct."
1032,303,4.0,i use this cable to patch my effects pedals together and it does what it needs to do.  the right angle ends make it easy to connect your pedals and keep them close together.
1412,883,1.0,The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. It now rest at bottom of a box.
1033,883,4.0,Great idea for keeping the stage floor less cluttered. Fits a standard X-stand just fine and makes a very secure connection.
1294,883,4.0,"works with myOn Stage KS7191 Classic Double-X Keyboard Standi got it to attach my mic to it - using this stand by On Stage as wellOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackworks as advertised.  You just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube.also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it."
516,883,4.0,"I have mine attached to one of the support arms on myOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Stand. While this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports, I was unable to use it with anOn Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Standeven with the top tier removed. The reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube, and had it mated, the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard.When attached to theOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Standwith anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackattached to the top screw-in post that perfectly mates with the boom, this attachment bar/boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard I use (aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoor aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard).Bottom line, make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar (according to the manufacturer it will work with most X-style stands), and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted. The total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 7.5"".  If your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar + boom or other mic holder to clear, you can gain an additional 3"" with aShure A26X 3"" Mic Mount Extension Tube."
674,883,4.0,"This is working for me quite well and is part of my keyboard stage rig now.I'm mounting it to a heavy duty On Stage brand double X stand. The resulting arrangement is reasonably stable, although if you put a bit of pressure on the mic stand you can rotate the Attachment Bar. I could tighten the handle further to prevent this, but am worried that this will begin to deform the X stand, and it is not a problem on stage. I am not worried that it would damage the Attachment Bar, as it is quite heavy duty.In general, it's strong enough to hold a typical stage mic on a small boom arm."
1346,684,4.0,I am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far I get a big punch aout of it . I tough I had to buy two of this but one works fine. I am running a dj karaoke system. I also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable. item received looks diferent I say better.
1347,684,4.0,Our second week and all is WELL! Nice and quiet. Using Speakon Cables (Mono) to each Speaker to Speaker for easy mixing. XLR to XLR from Mackie Mixer to PylePRO 1400 Watt amp. Great value for the Garage Band and recording to the computer for publishing on Web or using as a small GIG amp. Think I will get another one for the Stage Monitors. Might as well go ALL-IN!
1267,684,0.0,"As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective. Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday..."
1420,684,2.0,"Nice amp for the money but couldn't push a single Peavey SP218 Sub, so I moved this amp to push a pair of dual 15's, still had trouble getting the range that I needed, so I have this amp now as a back up and will probally use it for powering a single EV18 sub rated at 500 watts, it should handle it nicely bridged, I will keep you posted."
879,124,4.0,"It's rubber and you can slip it under the strings and into the sound hole...with a little effort. It might even be over &#34;engineered&#34;, it fits so well."
1169,124,2.0,"This product did not fit my Takamine G, as the hole is 3/4 size.  I had to buy from Lute Hole, who then customized a part for me.  Beware, because you'd figure this item would fit inside any guitar out there, given the advertising.  Even the guy at Guitar Center, when I called to find out what was going on, told me to go with Lute Hole.  I never had a use for such an item before very recently, but, upon necessity, I found out that this item is bound to damage your guitar, even if it does fit.  Be very, very careful.  In fact, be very, very wary, as I briefly heard a light ""cracking"" noise when I tried to fit it in the guitar for the very first time.  I stopped, thereafter, after doing research online and finding out about the G's specs.  I've read, elsewhere, that it kills your tone, but I had been willing to try to utilize it in tandem with my actual coloring rig.  Ultimately, I spent nearly $100 more than I wanted to, just for this kind of item.  What is it they say in this era - caveat emptor?"
964,124,4.0,Lifesaver.  I bought this and a Planet Wave's O-Port (which advertises that it can help reduce feedback as well) I use this at every show where I have to plug-in.  This is a must for anyone who plugs in and doesn't want to worry about feedback.
1113,124,0.0,"This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar.  I measured the whole at 3 7/8&#34;, but this cover does not even come close to fitting!  It measures 4 1/6&#34; in diameter, so check your guitar closely!"
329,124,4.0,Works as advertised. Eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned. A little tight. It needs some force to put it into place. Not sure if there's no standard among guitar makers on the size of the sound hole and Planet Waves just did their best guess on a universal fit product. But on my Washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there.
1100,124,3.0,"It works well, I use it for my Oscar Schmidt. I don't use it for feedback, I use it to protect it from the dust. It fits tight but it's fine!"
960,124,2.0,"it barely did anything but i guess thats because im the one playing the guitar, if you were in another room im am sure that it would make a difference"
99,124,4.0,Works as advertised. Great at eliminating feedback in a live setting. Also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly.
1328,124,4.0,"I am impressed how well this works. I was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs. This has solved it!It's important to you to know the diameter of your guitar's soundhole. I've tried this with 2 different acoustic electric guitars (Fender CD-60 and Fender Kingman), both of them with 10cm/4in diameter and fits perfectly.I had read all reviews before deciding purchase, and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering. I should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that. Even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound (unplugged), I would not consider this as a solution for it.If you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar, without hesitation this one is for you."
1139,124,3.0,It's good. Was having a lot of feedback and got tired of taping a make shift sound hole cover. Recommended.
488,124,3.0,"It is good, only thing I did not get was that it has the wire attaching it to the cardboard going through the feedback buster thing. so there are two minuscule holes on there not enough you can see but still bother me a little. Gets the job done."
455,124,4.0,Fits great and helps to eliminate feedback. I could see some having problems with the size of their sound holes and it can be a tight fit but it definitely works.
1235,124,0.0,"Doesn't reduce sound worth a darn.  I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things.  Muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in dB."
811,124,4.0,"This soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player, right up there with a tuner, string winder/cutter, cleaning cloth, pack of extra picks, and capo. It's designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system, which it does nicely. It's also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly (as in 2 nights like that in a case)."
387,124,4.0,Fits perfectly in sound hole.No more feedback or waking up the next room.No plastic smell either.Play an Ibanez acoustic electric.
710,124,4.0,"Works well, easy to install and take out.  Helps greatly to control acoustic feedback. I've looked at these for a while, glad I purchased it"
309,124,3.0,gets the job done. I would say it muffles too much though.  my arm feels like it went to the gym after a jam session
1170,699,3.0,"It does the job though. I wasn't impressed by the lack of range, but then again I've never found a use for the more extreme settings on a phaser anyways. It seems that this unit keeps the effect within a safe and comfortable range and that's okay with me."
501,699,4.0,"I'm very happy with this pedal.  It seems to be a knock off of the MXR phase pedal, being that it provides a nice classic, subtle phase effect.  You can flip the switch to ""swirl"" for a more pronounced effect, but I love just keeping it mild.The metal switch/button to engage the pedal doesn't have the ""click"" that many pedals do.  I actually prefer this.  The ""click"" effects wear out sooner.  Some of my high end pedals also use this smooth, click-less way of engaging a pedal.  You'll know it's on by the tone change and the bright led light.  IMHO, you don't need a click switch.The sounds are clean and smooth, clear and bright, and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effect.Quality and Value, all the way."
1075,699,2.0,"It sounds like it's Behringer.  Very fake, cheap sounding phaser, but it's all I need.  I got it mostly for that big airplane woosh, and running it in the loop, it does that fine.  The highs are kind of harsh, but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame."
1384,699,4.0,"Germany Company, manufacturing is in China... I have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two Behringer products that are in my hands are very good."
998,699,2.0,"I really dislike the switch on this thing.  It does not click.  That may not sound like much, but I tend to rest my foot on a pedal when I turn it off.  This does not turn off when I do that.  This is unlike any pedal I have played.  I realize Behringer is trying to copy the MXR, but the switch substitution makes me wish I picked up a used MXR.  Anyway the pedal sound fine, just know the switch may drive you insane.  I really like the other Behringer Boss type pedals though as the switch is what I like.  Wish the phase came in a different case."
1319,699,4.0,"I borrowed a friends MXR to try and liked the added sounds it gave me. It filled a hole that was missing . since 80% of my board is Behringer pedals I looked at Behringer first and was delighted when I found the PH9 Classic 90 . Side by side with the MXR , there wasn't a hole lot of difference and with the Behringer's added swirl switch , gives you a few more options. It also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize Behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals. ( I've read a ton of reviews and still haven't heard of one breaking because of the plastic ) As far as value to money spent , This pedal is again at the top of the list. Oh! It also sounds great!!!!!"
1169,632,4.0,"I give them an excellent rating.  They do last a long time, and they do not seem to alter in tone and get that ""muddy"" sound when they're aging.  In fact, I'd say they actually do manage to approach David Gilmour's tone at times!  I could barely believe that, of course, but after playing hard for a few hours, I actually said to myself the phrase: ""Wow, that sounded like David Gilmour somewhat.""  So, the fact that that occurred without me actually thinking about Pink Floyd or Gilmour and just being lost in the playing says a lot, because I then realized I had strung up the guitar with the strings that day.  Get them if you like Gilmour.  I'm hard on pricing, usually, but I say these are priced decently for their effectiveness."
1219,632,4.0,"As a huge Gilmour fan, it was a no brainer to pick these strings up.  Had been playing DR and Elixer for the past couple of years and  to my recollection,  have never tried ghs.  This custom gauge set plays great.  They tuned right up with very little stretching.  I will buy these again!!!"
1031,632,3.0,"The strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set. 0.1, 0.12, 0.16, 0.28, 0.38, 0.48 are the perfect balance between weight  and confort. It fits very well on my guitars: 1) Fender EVH Wolfgang, 2) IBanez S470. The cons is that these do not come with VCI, so expect some flakes when you open the pack."
858,632,4.0,"I'm a very big fan of David Gilmour but never was a fan of GHS's. So I thought I'm wanting to step up one gauge to 10's so why not try these. It took a little longer for them to get stable but My Strat and My Les Paul sound and feel Great. Now , ( and I didn't see this at first ) on David's Les Paul , He use's 10.5's and I have a Bigsby on Mine like His. I may try those next time on My Les Paul. I'm not sure how they will work on a Epiphone Les Paul 'cause I have a Gibson and there is a BIG diference. And on the MIM's Fender's either cause both of mine are American Standards. All in all I'm very pleased with the DG GHS's...."
708,632,4.0,"I use these on my Fender Strat, and they sound great. If you appreciate the talent of David Gilmour, and respect his taste and choices in music, than I would recommend these strings. I used to use Elixir strings, and as great as Elixir sound, they do not last long. These do. I have played guitar for over 30 years, and I am very happy with these strings."
862,839,4.0,"These have it all. Sound great, play great, feel great, tune great. I am now dedicated to these strings. It takes about 4 or 5 days before the strings are fully stretched and holding onto its tuning. Once it does, it's beautiful music after that."
809,839,4.0,"I play a Cordoba Classical, and these strings are the best I've found for it. The bass strings really resound, all strings stretch and hold within three days, and they last longer than I've expected for classical strings. I've not yet had a broken string with them."
909,839,4.0,"I've bought these D'Addario strings a few times because they are a great deal. They sound nice and bright, and they last a good while. They are easy on the fingers. The best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3-pack."
397,839,4.0,Put these on my new La Patrie Motif and could not be happier.The tension is just right for soft finger style &#34;manouche jazz&#34;Sleepy D'jango
1080,839,4.0,I did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area. And look like I make very good choice.
1143,839,4.0,"These strings aren't anything fancy, but they sound great. A good old standard that I've used since I was a kid. And this is the best price I've found."
513,839,4.0,These strings are as advertised.  Nice tone and good quality.  Can't remember the last time I've found a bad string from a set of these.  Actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar.  Got the high tension ones for a shorter scale instrument so they wouldn't be too sloppy at concert pitch.
1104,99,4.0,Works well for my needs. It adjusts and holds whatever microphone I use in position very well. A good buy. I would recommend it for light to moderate use.
1051,99,3.0,"I just used this for a gig on Monday ... it's solid, well built, nothing loose or floppy, it stands up straight (extending to almost 7 feet tall), it folds up easily, and is nice and compact when folded ... good enough for me.One further note, when I ordered this, I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base (which is also an ""On Stage"") and screw it into this tripod ... that's not the case, as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base.  I'm not unhappy though, this stand works quite well."
1400,99,4.0,absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you. I will get another for my monitor.
1048,99,3.0,"I bought this with my mbrace ,and it seems to be pretty sturdy. I would think it would work even better with a mic."
1027,99,3.0,I use this to mount my Stagg Small Musical Stand to hold a small format mixer for gigs. It's light weight and sturdy.
1237,524,3.0,"I have both the Fostex PM0.5 MKII and the BX5a Deluxe for a while now.  While the BX5a tends to get higher review rating and is more popular, I personally prefer the PM0.5 due to its having more bass & volume.  Both models cost about the same, with the PM0.5 roughly $20 cheaper.The PM0.5 is bigger, heavier, has a heat sink in the back, with a combo XLR/TRS jack.  While the BX5a has a bigger tweeter, separate XLR & TRS jacks.  Construction-wise, both are well-made.  If you plan to share the same monitor between 2 difference sources, then the separate input of the BX5a is more convenient (you can always get a Y-adapter to support 2 inputs on the PM0.5).The BX5a has more clarity & boosted details, but is more on a tinny side.  The PM0.5 has more boom but less treble.  I guess the difference is due to the size of the tweeter and the length of the bass port (the BX5a has larger tweeter & 1 rear bass port, while the PM0.5 has 2 front bass ports).  Sounds coming out of the PM0.5 resemble more of the ambience of my car & home stereo than the BX5a.For my home-studio purpose, I like the warmer sound of the PM0.5 more.  I do use them to watch movie once in a while, and the PM0.5 is more suitable as the main speakers, while the BX5a is better placed for surround speakers.For further references, I have placed audio samples of a song I wrote & arranged (so there won't be any copyright violation issue), re-recorded with an AKG C414B condenser mic, placed at same height as the tweeter, normalized to -15dB.  Hope they'll help making your choice easier (instead of having to buy both like I did :)[...]"
719,524,0.0,"These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again."
434,524,3.0,"I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer. That solution was successful. These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp. I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12"" celestion speaker. These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5"" Woofer and a 1"" Tweeter, 40W/30W respectively. Slight drop in the power output, but they are beefy enough that I don't really notice.The isolation pads they come with are paper thin, almost pointless. If you really need some, get some more substantial pads. The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours... not really concerned about that, but it's worth mentioning.They have great sound, excellent low end, lots of clarity throughout. They are pricey, but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon. I would really recommend not going to a retailer... even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online. Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors."
141,524,0.0,"Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!"
942,807,3.0,Definitely provided extra gripping surface.  The pick extends out from the rubber 'shell'.  Obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer.  Since you have the shell they are a bit thicker than a normal pick which may have to be gotten used to.  I know for me I prefer to grip the pick really close to the tips for harmonics and on these your fingers definitely don't slip but it's a bit more pic than I want.  So I do carry and use these occasionally but they aren't my everyday pick.
976,807,4.0,wish i discovered these years ago.  comfortable and the grip works wonders.  nice clear tones with this pick tips.  thanks
590,807,4.0,"This pick is def not one I'd use to solo with, but its def a good pick for slower, more acoustic oriented guitar-work. Whenever I play a song consisting solely of chords, i break this guy out."
1094,807,4.0,Picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology.  These pick are cutting edge.  None better.  Possibility created by the multi-flex feature and the grip.  Awesome.  These make me a better player.  I used to have trouble holding on to picks.  Problem solved.  Stress gone.
137,807,2.0,"For about 30 yrs. have been playing finger style only - usually with alternating bass, and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice.For the song I was performing, chords were Bm, E, F#m, and G (1st & 3rd position) and I needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro.I found a very old and very thin Peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue Dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so I then ordered the Fender Abalone Thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy.Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks, 12 Pack, Abalone, ThinMy ancient Peavey broke in half not long after, and I continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new Fender picks to arrive because I liked the extra flex)Seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings, but since I never liked using a pick at all, the Fender Thin works best for me and I'm enjoying learning to use it on songs like Eric Clapton's interpretation of Bessie Smith's ""Nobody Knows You...""I'll try the Dava picks again later if I feel the need. I play Simon and Garfunkel's version of Scarborough Fair which is exclusively finger picking and George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun"" - where he uses a pick, but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle.This is all on an acoustic 6 string steel guitar, using D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze light strings.Bristol by Blueridge BD-16 Dreadnaught Acoustic Guitar (Natural)D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, LightFor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before, the Fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it's not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings.The grip is better on the Dava, but they aren't going to flex as much. Undoubtedly better for more accomplished players. Most advice I've seen says try 'em all and decide for yourself. I was just amazed and delighted how much easier the Fender thin made it for me to get started."
1155,807,4.0,"I have tryed a number of pick's and the textured ones seem to work for me.  I have dexdarity problems, Regular pick's without grips come out of my hands cause I am unable to control them,  So I needed something with a little more weight to it  allthough my fingures want to move around a little bit  I love these picks  now I can move my thumb and index fingers back to the bottom of the pick,  and it feels comfortable,  I used to do that with other (non textured)  pick's, And I kept droping them.These pick's are a must have,  allso, sinse theire heavier then other pick's,  these and the Ice pick's really build up Your hand's And finger's.I love these  pick's,  Im  defintley getting some more."
33,807,3.0,So far I really like these. The thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light/medium. The grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool. I got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out. I doubt I will lose them.
804,807,4.0,"I take a medication that makes my hands shake; therefore, I have a difficult time with fine muscle movements. I switched from Dunlop Jazz III's, which I loved, to these puppies because they have a great feel to them and you don't have to worry about dropping them. They are also bigger than the Jazz III's, making it a bit easier to hold on to."
60,807,3.0,"I love the concept and design of these picks save one flaw-the rubber gripping goes down too far on the pick.  I don't know any guitar players that have their thumb on the entire pick, and since it goes down so far it's hard to pick clean without hitting the rubber on the strings sometimes.  I do love how they bend in the middle and the grippy rubber but I think they should scale the rubberization back a little bit."
402,807,1.0,"Good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. Probably good for strumming, but not good for lead."
768,807,4.0,I have always had trouble holding onto picks. My fingers just couldn't do it for extended play. Nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body! LOL. I wish I would have thought of these. They were just what I needed. They work great.
785,807,4.0,"I was still searching for a pick to replace the ones I left somewhere. I knew these were not the ones I sought, but they are great. They don't move around in my hand, I have yet to drop one, and for the first time I noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar. These sound great. I've found a new favorite pick."
913,807,4.0,I like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing.
201,807,4.0,I keep ordering more of these picks.  I love the rubber grip and the mediums are just the right thickness for me.  Great product!
921,807,4.0,I really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar.  The rubber makes it easy to hold onto and I feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well.
1083,807,3.0,"These picks are kind of thin, flexible, and have a good rubber grip.  They're as good for speed-picking as they are for strumming.  The only complaint I have is that they're too thin for me.  The pack brings 6 picks.  If you're looking for thin, flexible picks with a good grip, then these will do."
496,807,4.0,"The grip on these is pretty great, I haven't dropped them at all and I've been playing so much better. They give a nice crisp sound with my Elixir nanoweb strings."
555,807,4.0,"These are amazing. I'm an intermediate player. Have been for the last 30 years. I tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip. Every other pick I have used has turned in my fingers...loose grip, little sweat, slick finish. Ok now...thin? med? heavy? You can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick. Incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it. And I can even hold onto it. Very nice grip on these. I have to keep getting more cuz everytime I hand one to someone to try, it's the last time I see it. Just hit Add to cart. You won't be sorry"
1424,807,4.0,Picks are one of those items in which taste is 98% of what decides if it works for each or not. That being said I have to admit that these picks are very high quality. The design is really pragmatic and effective. I recently was introduced to these by a student of mine and I have to say for the first time in 15+ years I changed my picks.I used dunlop made with Lexan material and those I found to be perfect until these came along. Sometimes change is good! We just need to be open to it.
72,54,4.0,"..and that's a good thing. I wanted a tuner pedal that I could use under any lighting condition. My previous experience with Korg equipment made the Pitchblack a no-brainer.There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said except &#34;true bypass&#34; is nonsense. If your tone sucks when a device is not on then the problem is somewhere else, not in the effect. If you want to talk about unity gain, on the other hand, I'm all ears!"
187,54,4.0,My experience with this little tuner has been perfect...It's extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment / it's dead quiet when activated / easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you're tuning / Takes up very little room on a pedal board / the cream on the coffee is that it's under a hundred bucks - that's crazy for the build quality - it's a little iron BRICKI highly recommend this little guy - Korg got it right on this one..!!!
1030,54,4.0,"this tuner is awesome and accurate, very noticeable and what else can i say, for the price, best deal ever. get it! ps i use it for my base though, satisfied. thanks Korg!!!"
274,54,4.0,Excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning. Well-designed and rugged construction. I believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least 50% more. One-button operation makes it simple to operate.
71,54,4.0,"The best tuner for your board in my opinion! Great display, easy to view/read, and a simple click on and off that isn't noisy. Since it is true bypass the pedal turns off when it is not engaged, which is a great feature since the battery will not drain while not in use even when things are plugged into it. Silent on/off, and I have two of them. Recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig."
823,54,4.0,"The main reason I bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics, is because I had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings, and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop A that is a must. I have to say that after owning it for a while I must agree. I've used other tuners when I happened to not bring this one along and  thats been my experience. Also its easy to read which note you're on when you're on a dimly lit stage."
417,54,4.0,I use to tune with an antique Korg... I saw these baby on the road with Maroon5's James... just make sure your guitar intonation is perfect.
604,54,3.0,"This is my third purchase of this tuner. All three work perfectly. Very easy to tune my basses. One is for my younger son who just started playing the bass. The other are for me (one as a backup).The reason why I gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the 9v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post. I may have to tape it down to keep it in place. The other two tuners don't have this issue.Still, it's the best around. Buy it!"
769,54,4.0,"For me this is the best guitar tuner. It does the job correctly and doesnt go crazy when you're tunnin so, geat ;)"
1361,54,4.0,"Little to say about this incredible little stomp box: no color on your sound, build like a tank, large display perfect for those smelly and dark bars and joints where all musicians play and it has KORG brand printed...and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner.Cheers!!!!"
652,54,4.0,"I bought this tuner over the TC Electronic poly tune and I am very happy with my purchase. Very simple to use, great visibility and it does not color the signal when not engaged. It also has the ability to daisy chain from it into other pedals but currently I have no such need. I highly recommend."
1146,54,4.0,"There are some things in this life that you don't want to have to think about, and your tuner is one of them.  You have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner.  It is fast, reliable and looks great on the pedal board.  It is true bypass and doesn't add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all.  Your brand preference will guide your decision, but don't shy away from this well-made piece of equipment.  I would buy it again."
735,54,4.0,"This unit is the perfect solution for people whose amps do not have mute switches for tuning. It has an absolutely silent mode that mutes for tuning without clicks or pops when switched in, and its bypass (tuner off) mode is totally transparent to tone. Its 4 tuning modes make selecting one that works best for you extremely simple (I personally prefer full strobe). Its tuning is quick and accurate, and it doesn't hunt for pitches like some tuners will, especially with a 6-string bass. Its single 9-volt battery is only used when the mute/tuner mode is activated, so the battery should last a long, long time. The display is bright and clear. It's rugged, well thought out, solidly built, and simple.My only complaint is with the calibration mode: it's just a series of non-self-explanatory numbers that change when you hit the calibration button. Its explained in the manual, but could be clearer. I'd buy this again without hesitation, though."
884,54,4.0,"This product is easy to use, without any noise at all. I truly recommend it as a tuner pedal. I'm happy with this product."
994,54,4.0,"It is simple, accurate, takes up very little room, and has several modes that are nicely backlight.  To top it all off, it's about half the price of any other pedal tuner.  Korg... king of the practical tuner world."
79,54,4.0,"Only had it a few days but is working great and I like that it is true bypass. Price was outstanding and the tuning is spot on. The default tuning display is perfect for me as I've not been real impressed with some of the other top tuners out there. IMO you can't go wrong with this tuner, very pleased."
383,54,4.0,"I use this as the first pedal that my guitar cable touches as it goes into the pedal board. It's true bypass, which means that the sound is not affected when it's not in use. When you step on the button, the sound cuts out and you get the tuner. It works as advertised. My only complaint is that it could be smaller. There are other smaller true-bypass tuners out there if space is an issue on your board. I've posted a photo of this tuner on my board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. If you need a smaller tuner, I have buddies who use and like the polytune."
1071,54,4.0,"Awesome tuner, really fast and responsive. Best of all it is accurate, enough so that using this for setups has resulted in a much quicker easier process than I had anticipated. Nice and bright so I can clearly see it on stage in the dark. Occasionally I get a small pop when I engage it but not that frequently. This pedal feels good and sturdy too, I really cannot see anyone breaking it unless you feel the need to leap from the monitors on to the switch. Price is easy enough that if anything should happen to it, I would not think twice about picking another one up."
1238,54,4.0,"Just picked up the Korg pitch-black from Guitar Center yesterday. I use a Snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise. love the thing so far. its accurate, fast, fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price. i like the multiple display options and calibrations. Mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe. great buy, i am happy with it. i got it in red."
1397,54,4.0,"Easy to use, very accurate and great visibility of tuning indicators. This tuner did just fine with the low B on a 5 string bass. Some tuners to not work well with this low of a frequency."
83,54,4.0,"Very good tunner, with bypass switch. I think it's a good choise for any pedalboards. I changed this for a TC Electronic Polytune."
304,873,4.0,good pedalthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityI like the sound it is very goodI have 3 pedals and the pedalboard  behringer ******thank you for this product
1030,873,4.0,"wow for the price u can not beat this pedal, i got this pedal to add a second guitar harmony to some of my songs wow it sounds awesome, probably the only note here is that when activate it i noticed that kinda lower the volume a little bit, i do not mind though and still give it 5 stars."
1195,873,4.0,"It can be an octave divider (up to two up or down)It can do parallel intervals (a la Trevor Rabin on Owner Of A Lonely Heart)It can do intelligent harmonies (just make sure your guitar is IN TUNE so it can track your playing!)It can do Digitech Whammy-esque divebombs (up or down)It can do chorus-like detuningIt can do whammy bar flutter-copiesIt's a BARGAINIt's very welcome on my pedalboardIf it's what you're looking for (it's not Lexicon, it's not TC, nor does it profess to be) and you know how to use it you really can't go wrong.Get one and have fun! Because it's not programmable I'm getting another."
501,873,3.0,"I'm on my second US600 pedal, after the first one broke.  I plugged in a cheap cord into the input, and when I went to pull it out, it was stuck.  So...I applied a lot of force to pull the cord out.  When I did that, I heard something break inside the pedal, and when I went to use it again, it didn't work.I pulled the pedal apart and inspected it to see about repairs, but ended up opting to buy a new one instead.  Even though the pedal has cheap housing (which worries me a little bit), the Boss equivalent of this pedal is 3 times as much.  So since this isn't a ""staple"" effect in my pedal board, I'm happy to go with something cheaper for now.Pros:Cheap price- sounds greatCons:Cheap housing - may break if used a lot"
885,873,4.0,"Behringer US600 Ultra Harmonist/Shifter Pedal is pretty good.You need a little time to learn, then it will rock you.Just try it."
650,873,3.0,"They said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you're playing up to three octaves, but I could never get that feature to work properly.From video reviews I've heard on YouTube, this Harmonizer does not even come close to the Boss version, but it costs about $100 less.  Since I am not a professional musician and I am just playing around with it, it works just fine.  And ... you get what you pay for.Addendum:  I've now owned this for a while, and discovered that it can turn my six-string Strat into a bass, by turning the balance knob all the way to the right, and my pitch on the second from bottom position.  In fact, when I record my Dean Edge bass onto the Boss Loop Station and then record my Strat on top of it using the Behringer  Ultra Shifter/Harmonist, I cannot tell any difference in tonality.I am thinking of selling my bass.  It has just become a needless expense.  Needs the neck adjusted twice a year, the strings are expensive, and it is harder to play then my Strat."
1007,873,4.0,"Haven't got to far into this thing yet but I do like it.  Same classic behringer plastic housing that I personally never had problems with. Definitely get some odd tone change to work with here, I'd say check your YouTube channel to hear for yourself, if not familiar with the tones."
1091,873,3.0,"The Behringer US600 is well-made. The high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused. It is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass mode.I purchased the US600 specifically for the &#34;Detune&#34; effect. This effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps. The effect is particularly dramatic when Outputs A & B are fed into two different amps, giving a nice room-filling stereo effect.I was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects. The Pitch Shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect, about as good as I have heard anywhere. When using both outputs, it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp. This makes the guitar sound HUGE!The Harmonist effect is amusing, but it has limited uses. It won't make you sound like Duane Allman and Dickey Betts playing in harmony. However, it is handy for short solos. I tried it in the key of G and got useful results.The Trem Bar would work well in loud uses like metal. The Flutter effect gives a nice Leslie effect sound.Overall I think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals. I have seen several speak ill of it, but I'm not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal. There is quite a learning curve on this gadget, but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the device.One other observation: This is more of a studio effect than a road effect. There are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect. It would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor. I had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments. The only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect (Detune, for example) while gigging.In conclusion, I debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect. I'm glad I finally decided to get it. The great sounding Detune effect alone makes it worth the price. The Octave effect from the Pitch Shifter is a nice bonus. The other effects are icing on the cake. Kudos to Behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior!"
1044,873,1.0,"This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal. I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.Anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad."
387,873,2.0,"The Seller shipped very fast and I give them 5 plus stars; this review is regarding the actual product.The Behring US600 is a basic pitch shifter, don't expect elaborate effects.Made of plastic; not as sturdy as a BOSS pedal.Goes through 9V batteries quickly, so stock up.If you use an A/C adapter, get a hum eliminator.(Curse you 60 cycle!)Also run the US600 AFTER the distortion for optimum performance.Other wise you are shifting the clean signal.Distortion, pitch shifter, chorus, then out.This pedal gives you a sweet 12-string chorus sound and that alone is worth the 45 bones. The dive bombs, reverse dive bombs, and flutter are there. Don't expect a 2 octave bottom, because it doesn't do that.You will not sound like a Thin Lizzy dual guitar lead, but you can get that Bryan May, Queensryche meets the Allman Brothers harmonies in 3rds.For those on a budget, this pedal does what it doesn't advertise.Lacks true instructions, so go to YouTube and watch demos."
1238,873,3.0,"Super cool pedal with tons of applications. it sounds great for recording. i wouldn't take it on a tour or anything, it is plastic. the harmonizing function can be buggy at times. the trem function works great. it has a input for an expression pedal and i would recommend using one to save your pedal the wear......it is plastic. I love Behringer pedals, for the price you can get a ton of great sounding and functioning pedals at more than half the price of the Boss counterparts. one of my favorite pedals of all time."
456,185,2.0,"Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...It's exactly what you would expect from Behringer, it works...it's not great but it get's the job done, i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but it's still pretty useful for less than $25I don't regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withDanelectro D-8 Fab 600Ms Delaywell, maybe next time...I give it a 3 out of 5, it wasn't this time Behringer surprised me."
13,185,4.0,"This delay pedal was so cheap that I could not pass it up.  and let me tell you, it is easy and fun to use!  I stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar.  I actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica, but those were dismal failures.  Big win for the guitar though!"
888,185,2.0,"But is no match for someone who wants to use it to record with.  Use a plugin instead.  I like some of Behringer products even though they are snobbed.  This particular unit is not one of their finest products but I give them credit for the price point and effort.  Someone will appreciate it but not me.  It sits in my drawer and will end up being sold online as it's not defective but just not up to what I want.  Cheap, so no big loss."
553,185,2.0,"If you want to have an interesting echo and repeat, this is worth the minimal investment.  I recommend buying the multi-plug power supply as it goes through batteries fairly quickly and you will likely be buying other pedals to compliment this one."
586,185,4.0,An old school delay that works very well. Simple to use. Adjustments for intensity and length. Uses 9V batt or power adaptor. Reasonably priced.
403,185,4.0,"great little pedal. Has a nice set of adjustments to give a wide range of delays and echo to your sound. Easy to use, very low price, classic sounds. I wish I had 4 ears so I could buy another one. Strictly home studio use, haven't tried gigging with it, though it seems pretty sturdy, it is plastic, but pretty solid plastic. I also have a Danelectro  Fab Echo and this just blows it away. The Danelectro is okay, but it just doesn't have the depth or adjustment that the Berhinger pedal has."
432,185,2.0,"behringer products are cheap. some of them have good quality both in make and sound. hopefully, behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price."
377,185,3.0,"Some have complained that it's construction is not the best. I actually had to send the first one back because it did not work. But a new one came the day after I lodged a request for a replacement.It's a very simple echo device, I use just to give my guitar a little bounce. I prefer to play 'dry' most of the time so as to define better what I'm doing. But some solos need a little filling, and this keeps it subtle. It can do a lot more, but it's what I wanted.Sturdy enough, well priced, and simple to use."
995,185,2.0,"This does some fairly cool things to the sound, but there is a lot more out there.  This would be great for a new person experimenting with effects"
998,185,4.0,For the price of these I am very happy with the purchase.  I feel it sounds really good and has many settings.  I think the build on these are fine for daily use.  Don't expect it to break anytime soon anyway.
1319,185,4.0,"I replaced my delay foot pedal with the Behringer VD400 Analog Delay. For the money it is a more than a competent addition to my pedal board . It is doing exactly what I expected and much more. The big name delay I replaced , in all honesty , wasn't as good. I have more room and control with this pedal. Also I can buy six of these pedals for what I paid for the last one ... You do the math!!!!"
1081,747,4.0,"This thing is simple to set up and has a nice warm tone that I like for clean delays.  I also got the TC electronics nova repeater which has more options, tap tempo and stereo out, I use that one for distorted delays and dotted 8ths. They are both great pedals that I use all the time."
1253,747,4.0,Ok I replaced my Boss DD3 with this pedal because the boss was the only digital pedal I had left on my board and I wanted a complete analog board. This pedal is more subtle then the Boss but if you want some delay to fatten up those lead tones and retain the sound of your amp then look no further. MXR is by far better then Boss IMHO and I do love my DD3.
475,747,4.0,"This is an excellent choice if you're looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint.It looks great, it's easy to use, and it's a fantastic size for a delay pedal.The analog delay is nice and warm -- much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears. Also, the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays.There is a internal adjustment that I don't think I will need to use for now anyway.I highly recommend it !"
550,747,4.0,"This is hands down the best delay pedal I have ever used. I owned a Boss DD-3 for many years and I have tried various other brands, but this little beauty takes the cake. The delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound. It is very easy on the ears in both clean and distorted settings, and it adds exponentially to your tone. When turned off it is true bypass, which means it does not color your guitar's natural tone in any way. I recognized a notable difference when I unhooked my DD-3 and plugged in the Carbon Copy.The pedal is slightly smaller than most pedals but it is built like a tank. The price point is a little expensive but, in this instance, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a creamy, true bypass, analog pedal then look no further. The Carbon Copy is the best there is!"
842,747,4.0,"This is super warm and can get very trippy.  I like the depth it adds to everything from subtle, extreme and whatever else, the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too, nice extra.  600 milliseconds really is more than enough and I have a highend tape type unit that is something like 2.5 seconds but for what this does, more than enough.  I like retro and this is it, I used this on a show the day I got it and it was noticed by all.  I have to say MXR has really stepped up their stuff, very musical pedal.  Again, do your Youtube homework and listen around and you'll come to your conclusion.  Amazon is great to deal with."
76,747,4.0,"I have a LOT of pedals.... including many delays and echos...The MXR is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my Aqua Puss, EH Delux Memory Boy, Ibanez, Boss, and lets not even get into the Behringer stuff...  :)I like the chorus-like mod button.  Very lush and sweet to listen too.  Not as feature rich as some of my other delays, but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me.  Simple to use, compact and well built.  I like using this clean... but even it's ability to take some distortion is pretty good.This is simliar to my favorite echo (the Morely ECV from the 70's) in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it.  Lush is the right word.Hope this helps."
144,747,4.0,"The reverb broke in my amp and I tried the Boss FRV-1 to replace it and didn't really like it too much.  Then I read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby.  This is exactly what I wanted.  It fills out the sound and yet doesn't add any artificial high end.  Sounds gorgeous for what I do, which is playing alone in a basement.  For most songs it's always on, and it really excels at vintagy-sounding stuff like Rockabilly and Surf.  The mod button is a nice add-on but I haven't really bonded with it yet.If I had to buy this over again I might consider the Aqua Puss because I don't use the high delay times all that much and the Aqua Puss has an easy access battery door."
1126,747,4.0,"While I've never been a big delay guy, I've always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect.  I'm definitely not a fan of digital delay, so I did a lot of R&D; on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me.There are basically three options out there for delays under $200: MXR Carbon Copy, EHX Memory Boy, and Malekko Ekko 616.  I realize that there are other pedals out there, but according to my research these are the best three for the price.The Memory Boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation, something I was not interesting in.  Crazy effects are an EHX trademark so if you're looking for that sort of thing the Memory Boy might be up your alley.  I read nothing but good things about the Malekko Ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the Carbon Copy for a while and ultimately went with the Carbon Copy because I was able to find the most first-hand reviews of it.I don't regret my decision, this pedal sounds great.  The repeats are long and do not sound artificial.  Some people complain the repeats are too dark but I don't think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay.  If you're looking to recreate The Edge sound, analog delay is not for you.I'm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track, to slapstick, to dreamy repeats on solos.  I love it.  Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone.One minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile, at least out-of-the-box.  There are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but I have yet to mess with them.  I would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself."
426,747,4.0,"This is a great effect. I am very happy with it. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This delay device is (on my humble opinion) probably the best delay out there. It is very sensitive and delivers as it should, with a delay rate from 0 to 600 miliseconds. Most units offer a max of around the 400 mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards. This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver. I am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended."
401,747,4.0,"One of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal. Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps, is a great analog delay for under $175.00. Using bucket brigade circuitry, true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface, the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit. Utilizing the ""modulation"" switch, you can achieve a slight chorusing sound (like the flutter from old tape echoes) which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot.The unit has a small footprint (like most MXR pedals) so it is very pedal board friendly.This is truly a great sounding delay so try one out"
1066,747,4.0,What can I say? First it's MXR...enough said. This company (Dunlop) gets it right with the MXR line. I was a Boss guy but was never really happy with the delay or chorus from them. I don't hate Boss and use their Super-Overdrive in my chain. I already own a MXR Dyna Comp & Phaser 90 pedal so I took the leap and bought this delay. Wow! It's so much warmer than the Boss. Side by side the MXR won hands down...well at least for me. It goes from slap-back to space shot very easily... It's a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use... I'm really happy with this and would replace it god forbid...
1131,747,4.0,"This pedal really hits the spot!Warm vintage analog slap-back delay with optional modulation and ability to self oscillate (which, if you are a fan of Johnny Greenwood, you will love!). I also use it to give my guitar some sort of ambient sound, with the modulation on and very short delay time, sounds almost like a phaser."
514,747,4.0,"This is a great analog delay, analog meaning you're not gonna get a lot of crazy sounds and delays that last forever. If you're looking to get creative with lots of weird sounds, get the Boss Digital Delay. This pedal is intended to just color your tone a little bit and it does so in a spectacular way. I'm very pleased with it."
704,747,4.0,"Warm analog delay very natural sound, not sterile at all very ez to use, no harsh digital BS, I like this way better than the BOSS. Plus is is MXR and built like a tank to last a lifetime"
654,747,2.0,"this pedal worked well, but I sent it back because thru my marshall itgenerated a lot more line noise than I like, other than that it was cool!!!!"
803,747,2.0,"I don't have any problems with this pedal, but for the price I would just go with the Way Huge Aqua Puss for an analog delay."
1404,747,4.0,"It's the Tube Screamer of delay pedals. I use mine primarily to thicken up my tone, and definitely would miss it if it were not on my board. I have used it for situations that call for deep delay, and love the mod function which can get pretty spacey... I fall back on a EHX Memory Man chained to an Anaolgizer for a sick ping pong between the 2 delays in experimentation sequences, but when playing blues or thrash, I use it as tone beef only. Low settings not too echo-ey, more like a bass'd out reverb.There are literally a million different ways you can use this pedal, and it is a testament to it's versatility that it pops up on so many pedal boards in so many different genres.Hey - stop reading this and order it! Now!!!!"
1157,747,4.0,"The MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay is a relative newcomer on the pedal scene, but has become instantly beloved by professional, semi-professional, and amateur guitarists alike (I would be in the latter category).  As a longtime user of the Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, it was a bit jarring trying out the Carbon Copy.  But after playing with the controls a bit and appreciating the pure quality of the tone it produces, it quickly won me over.There isn't a great way to explain the difference between digital and analog delay other than to say that the former is more precise and percussive, while the latter provides more warmth and ambience.  The ""Mod"" button is suppose to add additional modulation to the tone, though I don't hear a dramatic difference.  But no matter what setting you use, there is something undeniably more ""real"" about the delay effect of the Carbon Copy versus other delays I have used.  Rather than repeat your notes verbatim, it almost sounds like a haunting middle ground between the reverb/echo effect of a large hall and digital delay.The range of this delay, fortunately, is quite wide.  I believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds.  To give you some perspective on that, slapback delays (such as rockabilly ""Stray Cats"" echo) are very short, probably under 150 milliseconds.  Rhythmic ""U2"" delays are usually around 350-450 ms.  Then there's even longer delays with a lot of repeats, a la Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.  This pedal is capable of all of those (though the ""U2"" style delay is better achieved with digital).  One note on that though - whereas the DD-3 uses three different knob range settings to cover its delay time, everything from 20-600 ms is covered with one sweep of the Carbon Copy's knob.  This makes it very convenient, but also a bit touchy.To summarize, the Carbon Copy is outstanding alternative to digital delay and at an attractive price point.  It covers the sounds of delay pedals over twice as large (and expensive), and belongs on any delay aficionado's pedalboard."
174,747,4.0,"This is a great pedal, very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board. I also like the tone a lot. Bear in mind I like the more vintage tones, it's not a crisp, crystal clear tone like you'd get with a digital delay, it's got more warmth.There's a great video on YT from proguitarshop.com that demos it very well. It's got great short and long delay, very smooth feel and the mod switch adds just the right amount of modulation to your tone to make it a tad fuller. This is not a bright sounding delay, it can be a tad dark at times if you're not careful.I use this for my long delay sounds and use another delay for short, slap back and echo sounds, it's a Mooer micropedal. They work well together too to get a huge, fuller, ambient type of sound going. I put the Mooer before the MXR in my chain. I use all my pedals right into the front of my amp as there's no effects loop.I hope this helps your decision. If you like warm, old school tones you'll dig this pedal."
1322,747,4.0,"I already had this pedal, but needed to add a little delay to two separate channels (stereo).  I liked this delay so much, that rather than buy a stereo delay, I bought another MXR Carbon Copy!"
374,747,4.0,"Just recently a few months back got my first tube amp, wanted a good analog delay pedal to go with it I found that the digital delay pedals left something to be desired at least for my ears.After a lot of research and reading reviews I decided to give this Pedal a try.All I can say is wow!It has excellent sound quality ,very low noise while off it is transparent in your petal chain.The settings are outstanding, you will not be disappointed very well-made."
83,747,4.0,This unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay. It's not so &#34;digital and bright&#34; delay like Boss DD3 or DD7. Mod switch adds a perfect &#34;chorus&#34; effect for 80's Metal Ballads sound.
345,482,3.0,"I had the Behringer DR 600 (Ultra Reverb), but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds. Although this unit is only $10 more, the difference in sound and tone may as well be $100 difference in quality of sound. That is, this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences. It may not have every reverb sound, but it has a nice selection, and they cover an impressive range, as well as giving you the option of &#34;wet&#34; (full) or &#34;dry&#34; (tinny) sounds and a &#34;trails&#34; that essentially adds some sustain. There's also an &#34;echo&#34; setting, but it's not very pronounced, though it does add an &#34;echo-like&#34; sound.So, my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualities.There are a couple of annoying inconveniences. One is the BRIGHT blue light (indicating &#34;on&#34;). This has been commented on before. I have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined. When it's on, you can't read the dials because of the glare in your eyes. I did find a solution. I put dark nail polish over the LED bulb. I had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming I desired.The second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color. This is impossible to read in stage (or even dim room) lighting. Of course, you can &#34;remember&#34; where it is or which one it is, but my other Behringer pedals all have white lettering, making them much easier to read. Every B. pedal has its own distinctive color, so that helps. My solution to this little dilemma was to buy some 1/4&#34; white vinyl letters from Office Depot and put them over the words &#34;REVERB&#34; on the pedal.It was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes, but now I'm much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations."
631,482,4.0,"This inexpensive pedal kicks ass, provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedral-like reverb. The 'Space' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note, providing a strange harmony. Some people pick on Behreinger because they're stuff is (still) cheap. I admit that two of their pedals (of the 10 that I have bought) underwhelmed me. This one is a keeper!"
485,482,4.0,"Works well, has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options.  I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb."
204,482,3.0,"The reason I bought this pedal was for the &#34;Space&#34; setting, which is essentially a shimmering organ, octave up effect. On the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking, and it can get crowded with chords, but it does sound ethereal and choir-y.Features:Time controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals, decay controls the length of the reverberations, tone controls the color of the reverb, and mix controls the level of wet to dry (it can basically cut all the dry signal if desired).The trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off; however, if your mix is set to max wet signal, no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off. I haven't really been able to use it effectively, so I just leave trails off.Dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument.Sounds:The classic reverb sounds (spring, plate, room, chamber) aren't very distinct from one another. The hall setting is bit more expansive; the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note, removing excess reverb for the latest notes/chords played. The cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds; and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delay.Cons:*The blue led is VERY bright, as on all Behringer pedals; I just cover it up with a sticker, and it still shows through.*the foot switch is digital, so it doesn't preserve state, and doesn't have the best assuring &#34;click&#34;*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift upAlso, almost 50% of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate, which can be removed, but that makes the pedal almost toy-like in weight."
746,482,3.0,"Up date from February 08 2011 Wow look at all of Them that did Not find My review helpful I should have up dated much sooner,Not that I care because I tell the truth and do good to please Myself Not a bunch of fools. The first time I turned It on It was exactly the Sound I was looking for Shimmer and Space verb.Okay I Am apologizing for ordering the last one I guess I take the easiest way of ordering but If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems but If You look on some search there are some still left. Behringer needs to look at what The Customers Is buying and make more of them. If Your buying this Reverb Machine then You must be wanting It for Its Ducking also called Shimmer and Space verb If Not then there are cheaper Reverbs as Danelectro as FAB Echo which Is a nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound and there Is the more expensive Line 6 Verbzilla, and Someone wrote Me and said Boss has or did have this effect there are Internet videos showing this effect. My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It has Ducking Shimmer which Digitech calls String Swell which Is a Violin type Sound and They call Space verb Giga verb and I made the mistake of buying the Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String or Volume Swell was Shimmer then If found what I was looking for on Internet video I hope. I had already Wrote some Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 and started having dreams about having this Sound effect again and just had to have It.How well this Behringer RV600 performs and Sounds I have Not received It yet to know but If possible I will do an up date but I have a Behringer EP2500 Power Amplifier that still works good which I even used as part of a Rife, Doug coil machine but the EP4000 would be better for that use Also the fan runs all the time."
1297,482,4.0,"Bought Verbzilla, Digitech RV-7, and the verbzilla's ripoff : Behringer RV600.The types of reverb i get from Verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths .. so for that many kind of modes, barely useful. And I HATE the fact that line 6 always used the MIX knob instead of the separated level and reverb/fx level, cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb, which is sucks.Then i tried the digitech rv-7. First thought was .. Wow, what a construction it's got there. Fancy knobs, and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover, velcro, glow in the dark sticker. And the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it. I love this one better than the verbzilla, cos you don't have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb.. but the problem was .. there's no heavy reverb there. I couldn't get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal. But I love the gated reverb feature among all modes. Every other modes are just nothing special really. It was just a light reverb i get.Aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal .. skeptical at first, and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has I was a little disappointed. But I really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one. And I'm very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does. It could be painful for guitar players, cos they cannot boost up your guitar volume without anything else if it's already full, but I could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob (since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full). I could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and it's hell loads of them.Let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that i've tried.. they are ALL battery hogs! It was ridiculous .. i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 5-10 mins of nonstop use of battery before it's dried up. So I suggest you to use the power adapter. And the only thing i hate about RV600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to it's place cos we have to put the spring back to it's track while closing it slowly, and that black plastic latch on the side doesn't feel it could last longI don't care what ppl said about this pedal, but it's been very useful for me and my synthesizers, we don't need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds. It's all comes back to our ability to make good music. Good luck guys!"
631,441,4.0,"I've been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970's.  [...] , running all sorts of things through them, chaining them in all sorts of configurations, and have endured many 'wall wart' pedal meltdowns over the years. I said all that b/c I don't want to come off as condescending. I've learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of 9v batteries, or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs. Check the polarity of the tip - is the tip positive or negative? You'll fry a Boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one. Make sure the polarity matches (most pedals want negative tip adaptors, except Digitech which want 1/8"" plugs). Make sure the voltage matches. A 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal won't power it. Checking that these things are right will save you some $, and some of the Behringer pedals (I use about six of them on my board...see product links) are ""polarity fragile"", and will break right away with the wrong adaptor.

257,441,4.0,Great unit for the price. It offer a lot of variations in echo delay types.It is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece. Even so would nothesitate to use that way. I can't say what battery life is as only use withan AC adapter. The EM600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps. I drive mine sometimes with the Behringer A/B box using one ofthe 2 pre-amp gain controls or the Behringer Tube Amp Modeler.Only downside is the settings type control for echo delay types is a bithard to read without getting close to it especially in dim lighting.This isn't really a big deal though and often don't put the EM600 on the floor..
204,441,4.0,"Pros:I bought this pedal primarily in place of a volume pedal, or swell pedal, because it does that function fairly well, and a lot cheaper. Aside from that, it also does nearly every other type of delay needed:*the tape/digital/analog switch slightly changes the sound of each delay*the trails feature can be useful for holding a sound (in swell mode with high repeats) when the pedal is &#34;off&#34; and then playing over it with notes or harmony*the time knob acts like an analog knob, pitch shifting when turned after playing a note*the repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation (sometimes runaway) depending on the delay type*the mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signal*stereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itWhile the pedal has small problems, it compensates by inexpensive fixesCons:The modulation is a kind of adjustable width/depth all in one knob, and isn't the best compared to a chorus pedal. Just a general warbleThe blue led is VERY bright, to the point where you can't see the settings on the knobs, so I cover it with a sticker (it still shows through enough haha)*The casing is plastic, but it is thick and durable enough (maybe not for consistent gigging)*being a digital effect, the footswitch is not state dependent, in other words, if you turn off the pedal, unplug it, and plug it back in, the pedal will turn on*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift up*there is no noticeable &#34;click&#34; when you change delay type; however, the led flashesOther notes:almost half the weight of the pedal is the bottom metal plate. The pedal without it feels shockingly lightweight, but with it has a good amount of heft."
447,441,3.0,"For those that don't know, this pedal is a copy of the more expensive Line 6 Echo Park. The two things that make it better than the real deal are the lower price and the (IMO) better tap tempo. You have to do an odd sort of clicking sequence with the Echo Park, but with the Echo Machine you simply hold down the footswitch for 2 seconds, and then set your tap tempo. When you're satisfied, just hold again to enter regular on/off mode. Foolproof.Some folks will point to superior construction with the Echo Park, and I won't totally deny that. That said, the effects modules and the construction of the Behringer pedals are basically the same - plastic where you'd like metal, and surface mount construction (practical maintenance is really only possible by the manufacturer). But again, there is a switch in the tone dock that requires maintenance at some point - if it can't be cleaned up, the dock becomes a paperweight.As best I can tell, all the other settings are the same between this copy and the original. That makes sense, as it saves Behringer the costs of any R&D; - they just had to make it fit in the dimensions of their enclosures, and alter the tap tempo algorithm/access. That's a win for the customer because it decreases the price. For those who find a moral dilemma in buying a copy of something else, I'd submit that most of what is in your pedal collection has probably been either partly or wholly copied from something else. Unless you want to restrict yourself to the known originals and the prices they fetch, this is oftentimes the standard option. If there is a worthy improvement (IMO in a practical sense usually more than a sonic one), it would kind of behoove you to insist on the original. The tap tempo on the EM600 earns its purchase, just like the lower noise floor of the Biyang Compress X earns it as a purchase over what it copies 1:1 - the venerable MXR Dyna Comp.So why only 4 stars? Because it's a 2-way street - the cost cutting means that this pedal will potentially be something for the landfill in years to come. There's no denying this, and to get 5 stars requires unsurpassed durability at any price point. Despite what you may think, it can be done - the flipside is an ever so slightly higher cost. Behringer probably decided they preferred the increased profit per unit instead, or didn't want to go above a certain price point and risk getting beat by direct competitors.The other BIG reason to knock a star off is that with a little amp that you have to crank to get acceptable volumes from, there is quite a bit of audible hiss from this pedal. If all I used were my bigger amps, I would have never noticed, and it wouldn't have been an issue at all. But the 21st century is a time of lower playing volumes in live settings, which means the smaller amps are more popular. So the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker. It might be slightly lower than the P.A. you're using, but I wouldn't be so sure. I'd say you'd want a (true) 30 watt amp to ensure this isn't an issue, but that may be absolute overkill for the gigs you play.But my aggravations are really small ones. Overall, this pedal works fine through any amp I've tried it with, as some are kind of picky especially with delay pedals. I've typically found digital delay to work better with drive/OD/distortion pedals as opposed to analog delay, and this pedal is no different - as much as I like my MXR Carbon Copy and BBE Two Timer, they aren't nearly as flexible. This one IMO is on par with the flexibility of the old Boss DD-2/DD-3 or Danelectro Dan Echo. But it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects. Many of those are something I would never use, but I could imagine how others would absolutely love them. Or - they could come in handy for something specific, or be great flexibility in the recording studio.Also worth considering is that at the EM600's price, you could buy a backup or a 2nd one for different settings."
1360,441,4.0,This pedal is amazing. It has so many functions. Unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic. I love this pedal and I would completely recommend it.
612,702,4.0,"I like this bag, though it is slightly different from the bag that is pictured.  It's a bit too big for my tenor uke, it's most probably made for a baritone uke.All in all a good value for the money!"
327,702,1.0,"Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it.  There are gig bags and there are gig bags.  I've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags.  I expected more. This one offers almost no protection.  The only reason I have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may end up returning it anyway.It *did* fit my Kala KA-TG with room to spare."
1255,702,4.0,"This is my second Makala gig bag. The first was a smaller size for my MK-C concert uke, the second was the one above that I purchased for my Oscar Schmidt Tenor OU6.My OU6 actually came with an O.S. logo'd gig bag included, but while I love the uke the bag was PA-thetic. Single layer of fabric providing no protection. After comparing that bag to the one for my Makala uke, I came straight to this page and ordered another Makala bag.Why do I like this bag better? Its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside.  You can carry it around, set it down, let it roll around the back seat of your car (a little) without blemish to your instrument.  As good as a hard case?  Of course not. But very good for a bag.I also like the fact that there's no logo on the outside. I can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke I want inside. That was a disappointment for another reviewer, for me it's a plus.What don't I like?  The dorky pad around the handle.  Both my concert & tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it.  It's not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle!  And it just looks better without it."
881,702,4.0,"The construction, fabric, color and padding are all A-1. This is a super bag! My precious uku will always be protected and look good too."
187,759,2.0,"It cannot be denied that the BOSS DD-7 is a versatile effective product...And it does EXACTLY what it claims to do, and does it well - but - I have a mixed relationship with this pedal...On one hand it does so many things with REVERSE / MODULATE / ANALOG settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings it's a versatile tool - in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing... (one thing)In a live setting you have to set it and forget it (period)The four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are UN-USABLE (cannot be used) in a live dark stage environment...so when I'm at home putzing around on my guitar the BOSS DD-7 sits on my pedal board and gets used, but when I have a gig, it get's pulled from the board and the MXR Carbon Copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category... The MXR Carbon Copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions... so it gets used up there when the pressure is onThe BOSS DD-7 is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment ONLY - if you go live with it - good luck"
434,759,4.0,"I literally just took this pedal out of the box an hour and a half ago and it has already blown me away. I've only begun to scratch the surface of what this pedal can do, and i've made funky/weird loops of sound, bizarre cricket noises, long delays that instead of fading out actually get LOUDER with time. I dont know how else to say it, If you are looking for a delay pedal, you just found it. This thing can do anything.It feels like the iPhone of delay pedals to me so far... like it can do all this crazy cool stuff... but oh yeah, it can also just do an echo too. (Wait, you can call people with an iPhone?)I could have waited a week or so to really learn everything this pedal can do and write a detailed review of it's performance, but i dont feel i have to. It's the latest BOSS delay pedal... what else is there to say?Also with the price range of 130-160 dollars its a huge bargin compared to other BOSS pedals that might pull off a similar effect such as the RC-2($180-200), or RC-20XL($240-300). Granted i know very little about the FULL capabilities of those pedals, but the DD-7 has up to 40 seconds worth of loop play in ""Hold"" mode. And the hold mode is so much more sophisticated that what I am familiar with... since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the DD-3.Sorry if I'm rambling, but seriously I'm in love with this pedal. Perhaps i will post a video demo of some of the weird junk you can do with it at some point."
568,759,4.0,"Excelent product, great quality and useful in many different ways, I specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing, since it can record up to 40 seconds and it will not end unless you stop it, this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos, I also have it connected in a FXs loop with the Mustang fender IV, and it works just perfect in stereo mode, the reverse mode rocks, allows you to do great fading delay violing efect, this is simply the best pedal I got since it's so versatile, I do play Metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ!! Love it"
1065,759,4.0,"I have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades.I like this one the best...especially for the price range.Boss DD-7 beats the pants off the Line 6 Echo Park delay. The Echo Park delay causes a little noise/interference when not used, being caused by the little LED light flashing...you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp. The Boss DD-7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone.Many great features including an on-the-fly sampler/looper.The ability to control it with an external pedal/switch.Easy to set and adjust while playing live and on-the-fly.Matches perfectly with other Boss pedals.Standard ""Built Like A Tank"" Boss construction is renowned for.It also beats the other Boss Delay pedals available for quality, sound and features.Many options, settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile.I bought this for quality, ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live.It also ""self-oscillates & freaks out"" quite well. (If you're into that sort of thing!)Make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual. There are ""new"" operations and ways to ""set"" this pedal up to perform certain functions."
790,759,4.0,Pedal infaltable!! Es muyy bueno!! tiene todo lo que se necesita en un delay!! Como solo boss lo sabe hacer!!
989,759,4.0,"This pedal is awesome. Not only does the DD-7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay, modulation, and loop functions. It's capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing. This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player. Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards. This means their stuff is made to last. No flimsy plastics, cheap rubber, or faulty components or parts will cut it in Boss's supieror product line."
1287,256,4.0,"Needed this cable to hook up my Dean EVO to a practice amp. Can't complain; it's a pretty nice, standard instrument cable that makes my guitar sound clean and loud, which is what I wanted."
144,256,4.0,"These cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the USA.  I had one just like this with the Neutrik connectors (gave away as gift) and now have two with the G&H; Show Saver connector option.  This makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price.These cables are well-balanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass.  They are well-shielded, look nice, and handle well.You could pay more for gold plating for slightly better corrosion resistance or for woven coverings to make the wire look cute, if you want to."
162,256,4.0,"I bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an all-in-one guitar/amplifier/etc. kit that finally went bad.Seriously, for the price, these can't be beat. I'd even pay a lot more for them. Don't let the off-brand name put you off. Go ahead and get them - you'll be glad you did.I'm using mine on a Strat straight into the amp, and also through effects pedals, and through both paths they work great: no added hiss or other noise, no pops or cracks, nothing. Perfectly quiet cables that deliver the signal from the guitar at full strength without modification.Get 'em."
973,256,4.0,"I have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard. I wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time. So, I tried this cable and it works perfectly. Very heavy cord and top quality construction. Can't beat the price either. Will buy again."
1192,256,4.0,"Works great, just what I needed to have to walk all over the room. Now I sit in my chair"
1312,761,0.0,"Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them. The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. Expensive locks too."
870,761,3.0,"These are nice strap locks, but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose. This can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut. Otherwise these are a good value with easy on & off."
667,761,4.0,"I've read the revues and some don't do them justice. These fit very well, do the job they're supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar, just use a cordless drill to attach them, make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit."
294,761,4.0,"It does everything it's supposed to do. I got these for about $12 here on Amazon. The Dunlop or Schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that I can see.They lock securely, don't require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar's hardware.I have both Dunlop and Hennessy straplocks and I don't see any reason to pay more for the Dunlops."
86,480,0.0,"I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes.  Issues not only continued but worsened.  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes.  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help.  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par.  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative.  They caused me to go out and buy another amp.  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast.  I'll never buy this brand again."
1026,480,4.0,"If you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp, drop one of these in the V1 position (the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier).  Easy to do, and you'll notice an immediate increase in distortion.Placed one in a Fender Blues Junior.  Before when the master was down and the pre-amp/volume was all the way up, I could barely get some overdrive.  Afterwards, it had plenty.  Night and Day difference.Good sound too... Not harsh, adds harmonics.  Very lush sounding.  Tung Sol knows how to do it."
886,480,4.0,"PEOPLE!  YOU NEED TO BE STATING WHICH AMP AND SPEAKERS YOU USE OR YOUR REVIEW IS POINTLESS!That being said, the reason is because every amp will cause the tube to react and sound differently.  Speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice. Type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome.Amp:  Vox ac30hw2Speakers: Celestion Alnico Blue 8 ohmPower Tubes: JJ EL84Pre Amp Tube: Tungsol 12ax7 in V1 and the stock Ruby tubes in the other 2 spotsHow I Set My Amp: Volume just before breakup and 12o'clock with bass and treble knobs (changes per guitar but stays close)Guitars Used: Fender Telecaster Deluxe 'Chris Shiflett' with stock pups, Gretsch Silver Falcon 2010 with stock Filtertrons, Gretsch Sparkle Jet Blue Pearl with stock Filtertrons, Fender Jazzmaster 65' American Reissue with stock p90's.I also purchased a JJ12ax7 to see how that sounded so will compare the ruby, JJ and this Tongsol preamp tubes.I found the Tongsol to give me the best tone over all.  Less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp. It caused just enough high end roll off to give the warmth I've been looking for (to my ears). I found the JJ12ax7 to be much clearer but slightly harsher in the high end-maybe more Fenderish? I REALLY like the way the Tungsol makes my Jazzmaster sound.  It's heaven!  It gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs.My findings could and probably will be different from yours because of your guitar, cable quality, pick attack and style of playing. My best advise is BUY MANY different brands and TRY THEM ALL in your amp. they're not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones.  Most likely you will buy a different amp at some point so keep the tubes to maybe use in that one."
132,480,4.0,Tone is subjective. I have little experience with tube voodoo. So all I can say is that it is working well for me. I would buy again.
1089,480,4.0,This is a very quite tube and has all the gain you'd expect from a great 12AX7 tube. If your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick.
892,480,3.0,"Well made tube with good amount of gain and highs. Excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity. For high gain metal, however, I found that it's a bit too hairy. For instance, as V1 position in my preamp, it had a little too much trebly sizzle versus other tubes. For comparison, a Sovtek has less of this ""hair"" and is tighter sounding but also has more of an upper mid-range fizz which can get annoying. In the end, I switched the Tung Sol with a Ruby AC7 which was formerly in the V2 (overdrive) position, and that got me better articulation with less fizz. So Ruby AC7 in V1, Tung Sol in V2 - that's been my best combo so far."
761,817,4.0,"This thing doesn't tip over easily, which is perfect for my teen son who isn't all that easy on his equipment. Adjusts easily enough, and the price is perfect."
1346,817,3.0,the base is heavy and you screw the pole to it once you do this they should not be undone or you may damage the tread this makes it incoveniente to carry for mobile dj's. for the price and quality I would buy two other ones.
1347,817,4.0,Excellent value and you know what... It is identical in every way with the Retail store Product! Same made in CHINA product with another no name LOGO stuck to it. Perfect for the Garage Band!
1247,817,4.0,Always good to have a stationary MIc on the floor.  Sometimes it is weet nestled in a drum set or for a singer that might not want to play any instrument but just wants to stand tall... went together perfectly and I really wanted it...Shipping was fast and no problems... thanks
1314,817,4.0,"Bought for home use, bought the musicians gear 13"" gooseneck to go along with it for playing guitar while singing. great mic stand for the price."
1249,817,3.0,"This is just like any other microphone stand. It works the same and is pretty durable. The weight at the bottom will definitely stop it from falling if someone were to acciddently bump into it...which is great, but could also be bad if you want to carry the stand around a bit. In order to do that you must either support the weight, which can be a pain or unscrew it from the base. Other than that, it's great."
302,817,3.0,"There's nothing wrong with this stand, but for the life of me I cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand."
815,817,4.0,Mic Stands can be a hassle sometimes. This is not one of those. Always works. Adjusts easy. Holds in Place. Great all black look. Built to last and great price as well.
146,817,4.0,Bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design.  Works great and base is out of your way.  Much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around.
416,817,4.0,This stand really stands up to the wear and tear of use. It is well made and I would buy it again if needed.
1208,817,4.0,"Not much to say about the mic stand, it's what I expected it to be so thats good and the price was right. NO problems with the seller the product came quickly and everything was in great condition."
164,817,3.0,Great stand for the price. Threaded fine and it's heavy enough for any mic you've got. there are better out there but it's a good value.
80,817,4.0,Really great quality item. It was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up. It's durable and I suspect will last me for the rest of my days.
1017,817,3.0,"The adjustment screw/handle bit still works after 2 years, and the base is heavy- a cast metal.They look good and the paint lasts- great for a performance space.Now about the title- I used one (I own 2) as a sledge hammer during a band bonding event. The base ended up striking the concrete patio, and a chunk of the base broke off. Not a issue with manufacturer, but don't drop it too hard. Despite the break, the stand still sits upright, and i still use it.nice and cheap."
471,550,4.0,"I got mine and I gave it a try, here are the conclusions:1. It looks really good, sturdy and well made.2. Is super stable, I tried it out with: 2 Strats and a electro acoustic, then removed one  Strat and placed another acoustic (a 12 string this time). I pushed the stand and.... It holds. As guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar/bass or whatever you put in there falls down.3. You can set the height, always considering that your guitars don't reach the floor.So....... Totally recommended!"
1172,550,4.0,"Oh Man, My Guitars have a new home, love this stand, looks nice and works excellent, currently I have a Strat Style guitar a bass and a Epi Les Paul hanging on this baby, but even with just one guitar it holds up just fine, No unsteadiness, no wiggling, Big space saver, definitely a Good Pick, Great for home use or on the road, it folds up nicely, great padding on heads and body supports, 10 out of 10 on this one."
928,550,4.0,"For me this stand is very well built, not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price. They don't touch the floor. There are safety straps that hold my 3 acoustic guitars (Fender, Ibanez and my anybody's guess antique)in place without any difficulty, so I don't have to worry about knocking them off or over. It takes up very little space, the biggest plus!"
1258,550,4.0,"Stringed instruments are best hung vertically, which this stand accomplishes beautifully.  Constructed of very durable material making this a wise investment."
1401,296,3.0,"My band was playing out one night, I use an amp stand that was on the stage. I really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve it's sound and decided I had to have one. I started searching around and found this product. The price was right so I took a chance and purchased one sight unseen. The Musician's Gear stand does everything I needed it to. It arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble. It's light weight, portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to 75lbs. I would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less."
585,296,4.0,I'm enjoying it.  I actually bought it keep my amp off the floor but I also like that it puts the amp at an angle pointing upwards.  It's supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasn't tilted back or fallen over.  I'm glad I bought it and would buy from the company again.  Thank You.
732,296,3.0,"It's sturdy, well made, and cheap.  You couldn't go out and buy the raw material and put something like this together for what you pay for it.  I've used it with a couple of amps and it'll handle up to say an AC30 without an issues."
1412,296,4.0,"Expect less for that price. Excellent, fine manufacturing, good finish. Perfect for my Line 6, 75 wt. It works well at all heights."
538,296,3.0,Although I never gigged with it I think this would be great for any musician who gigs with a 2x12 or a 2x10 combo amp. I used this with various fender and line 6 amps and it worked great for amplifying the sound. Would buy again if given the circumstance.
1016,296,3.0,"If was looking to get my 3 amps off the flood. I have 2 70w 12&#34; amps and a big Fender DSP 212. I am using this for my 1-12 amps. It works very well. I recommend them to do the job for the $$. I am not sure I would use them for a $1,200 Sunn V4 4x12 cabinet"
82,296,4.0,Great deal for the price and very sturdily made. Easy to assemble and feels very solid. Way cheaper than I saw in Guitar Center. Im very pleased with this stand. I bought two.
905,296,4.0,"I use this stand for a smaller 50 watt Fender amp.  I don't think I would recommend it for larger amplifiers, especially since it sits a little high, but for my amp, it's perfect.  Nevertheless, I also don't really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much, so I can't imagine it being ideal for portability.  If you have a music studio and are doing more recording and/or rehearsing than playing gigs, this is a really nice stand."
810,296,3.0,"Needed a stand to lift my PA mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use. For $20, this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation. But it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting.I took the lead from reviewer W. Jones and ""removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical, and although my amp was more stable, I still didn't feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting."" I am using at the lowest height and it is stable, but I highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used.I give four stars for great value at $20, will suit my needs very well."
307,296,4.0,"It's perfect for what it does and that is to hold your amp and tilt it a bit toward the ceiling.  Great price, great stand.  What more do I need to say???"
409,653,4.0,"=] - Really satisfied with the chair. I cannot explain how cool this chair is. Very glad I got it, definitely worth the price for the great overall value that this chair really gives you."
165,653,4.0,"I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing. This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss. The back rest support is nice, too. For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country."
82,653,3.0,Great deal for the price and very sturdily made. Easy to assemble and feels solid. Recommend this if you're tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music.
516,653,4.0,"This is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest.The height of the backrest is fixed, but you can adjust how far back it can be moved. I am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle. The seat itself has a nice, comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne (I apologize, but that is my best reference for comparison.)Assembling is simple and fast. I had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar, but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances I managed to get it done with no problems.Another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists. The foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular, nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals. However. this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture.I used this with drums. but be aware that the seat will not swivel, so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand - unless you move it back a bit.The final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport. It's not a deal breaker. On the contrary, it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience."
218,355,4.0,"Went shopping at the local music store for a guitar case, too expensive.  Went to Amazon found a great case, great price and free stand."
481,355,4.0,Great value.  Works great.  Easy assembly.  Must fully expand base before you set guitar in it
47,355,4.0,"It arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it (the base, the bottom fork and the top fork) and it didn't take much assembly to put it together.  It does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well.  I will probably buy a couple more of these.The only downside I can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin.  I hope this doesn't eventually have a hole wear through it, but over time I could see it happening.  I suppose by that time I could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though."
231,355,4.0,"I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. Came very well packaged and with all the pieces. I was very easy to assembly and looks great! For the price, you really can't go wrong with this guitar stand. Works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. The added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won't fall off. Padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. Great stand for the price!!!"
15,355,4.0,I bought a couple to replace some of my old rusty chrome stands and was skeptical at first.  I have several bass guitars and they are very stable and very economical.  Have bought several more.
1090,355,3.0,Is a good stand. Relatively small but is a secure. The locking top is a good feature as well. Id recommend this over the larger tubular type.
557,355,4.0,"I feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr&oacute;n which is at least as big as, but much thicker than, a cello. But its design appeared amenable to some home-modification that might make it work, so at the price I took a chance and bought it. Well, the back of my guitarr&oacute;n bulges out like a blowfish, so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork, but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended, my guitarr&oacute;n's body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks, like they were made for that. No modifications needed, not even bending.Some reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over, but I suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs COMPLETELY open and therefore extended to its widest base. If you don't really LOOK closely as you open the legs, you'll think you've reached the stop before the legs are fully open. I didn't have it fully open at first, and it was a just a bit too easy to push over, in my view, but still acceptable. When I discovered that I still had to open all three legs a bit more, I retried it and it was much more steady. That last 1/4"" (6.3mm) of movement on each leg was worth 100% improvement. The stand is fully as steady as I had hoped it possibly could be, especially given the price. Amazing.Anyway, I gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all. I even like the way it appears to physically clamp down my guitarr&oacute;n since it seemed to discourage itchy fingers from trying to pick it up while I was on break."
965,355,3.0,"I purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter. The item works fine. It is not overly strong or stable, but the prices was right."
140,355,4.0,"This seems to be a nice, rugged stand.  Much better than the one I received with a guitar I ordered.  It went together fast and is well padded.  It cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid.  I'm not sure how much I will use it now I have discovered guitar wall hangers, or string swings.  I prefer hanging them on the wall and not having them on the floor in the way, just my preference.I suppose these would be good for mic night or doing a gig, but I don't expect that will ever be something I do unless I get a lot better than I am now.  I still suck....but I'm having fun and trying."
426,355,4.0,This is a very well-built stand. Looks good too. It does its job well and you can definitely be sure that it will last quite long. Highly recommended. Cheers!
1062,355,4.0,"Great stand, durable, folds down nicely and really does the job!  I keep one at home and just ordered another one for school."
901,355,4.0,"would buy again, works great, built good, steady, strong, I bought 5 of these total from diff. dealers, all do great"
972,355,3.0,"serves the purpose.I NEEDED A STAND AT HOME AND THIS DOES JUST FINE.I LIKED THE PRICE. I WOULD PREFER THE CRADLE NOT TO SWIVEL, BUT I AM HAPPY."
208,355,3.0,The stand arrived very quickly.  Came in a few pieces but took all of about 45 seconds to put it together.  the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar.  Excellent product.
825,355,4.0,"It's nice for my son to be able to stand his five string bass up in his room on display, while still having it be kept safe.  It helps him remember to practice when he sees it."
335,355,4.0,I used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier. Now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer. It really makes the guitar stand out. It was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it. I recommend this product. Works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time.
494,355,3.0,"Last week I ordered a Guardian Electric Guitar Stand (A-Shape, Black) Price: $10.99 from Amazon based on an average 4-star review.  I read the reviews first and placed the order, for a cheap, collapsible guitar stand for my electric guitars and bass.  When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it - lol - no way.  Worthless, and it's now holding my son's 3/4 size classical guitar (barely).Undaunted, I ordered this Musician's Gear stand.  Less expensive than the Guardian, it holds my Gibson CS-356 Custom with no problem and I would trust it with any and all of my electric guitars or basses.  The bottom piece that supports the body of the guitar rotates, and that's a little strange (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but with a little care you can put a guitar into it and remove it with little or no attention to placement. For $8, you can't beat it.JM Tepper"
1212,355,4.0,It is a guitar stand... does what it is built to do... good buy for the cost... I would purchase again.
873,355,4.0,"My guitar, just Love it! This stand is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is all I want or need from a stand."
279,355,3.0,"I have bought three of these. I managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand. The connection could be stronger, but it was my fault that I broke it. They do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice."
78,355,4.0,"I was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad I did.This stand is VERY sturdy, well made & durable.Foam padded everywhere guitar touches!! Can be folded for easy transport!! Rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard!!Pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand!!Highly recommended, very happy with purchase!!Joe"
910,355,4.0,For the price it serves as a good resting place for the guitar when not being played.  Well designed and useful.
466,355,2.0,"Its a nice stand....cheap, but should suffice. I wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine."
1305,355,4.0,"great stand well made safe for ur guitar and practical w safety cord on top . worth getting it. this is one of the better stands out there cuz its well made and great cushined for ur guitar,, and with a great price,"
1239,355,4.0,Works great as a stand for the Elec.Guitar. Work good in corners. And I like it For starting out learning.
1152,355,3.0,This guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble.  I have no complaints about this stand at all
1375,355,3.0,Comes unassembled but is a no brainer to connect the 2 pieces to the frame. works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand.
1395,355,4.0,I was amazed how much better this stand was then the one I had just bought at Guitar Center for the same price. I thought they would be the same but they were not. This stand is built much better.
282,355,1.0,"I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it. Upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe .025&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.For $10-11 I did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.This stand does have one other good quality- it is CHEAP! Since it was less that $11, I cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. I was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. The stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand."
438,355,4.0,"I actually own an even dozen of these.  I've never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars.  They work great & you can't beat the price.  I think I paid around $4.95 for most of the ones I purchased.  Although these are great & I will continue to use them as needed (e.g., when playing), I just replaced these today with Swing String Wall Hangers.  I freed-up so much of my floor space by moving 12 guitars to the wall that I was actually excited about all the free space!!!"
1288,355,4.0,"this is a great product. very light, very sturdy and at a low price.  well worth the investment."
777,355,4.0,"This is really a no frills stand, except the addition of a neck guard strap, which is a nice touch. It is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable. There's really not a lot more to say about it, except that, at $7.95, i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed. I would certainly not spend 20 or 30 dollars on a stand when i could buy one of these."
697,355,4.0,I am very pleased with the quality of this stand. It is actually better than my other two and costs a lot less. It shipped on time and the packing was good.
1046,355,4.0,This stand really is pretty tough. I have carries it in my gig bag and it has been thrown around and stepped on etc.... Still works great.
44,355,4.0,"There isn't much to get excited about in a guitar stand, however, it does it's job and the price was right. I purchased four and they were all delivered on time. Each adjusted to, and held, its guitar securely. I have found the stand to be very stable. The welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job. My music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much. It's does not appear to be of better quality."
917,355,3.0,"Seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money, my banjo likes it.  It was shipped quickly and in good shape, thanks!"
435,355,2.0,A good moderately priced guitar stand.I had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result I replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware store.A good moderately priced guitar stand. I would recommend purchasing it.
121,355,4.0,A inexpensive guitar stand that was easy to assemble (1 minute) and holds up well. Very pleased with this purchase.
883,355,4.0,I use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it. A day doesn't go by where the stand is not in use.
1163,355,4.0,"Just finished setting it up. Works perfect. Stout, stable, and even looks good. It's holding a Gibson Les Paul, so it has to be trustworthy! Great price. Wayne"
1035,355,4.0,"I was a little unsure when I was unpacking this stand as the actual rack swings side to side. When I put my guitar on it, it was fine, it held perfectly. This cradles my guitar nicely. I just wish that it was like the one in the picture and was straight. It actually reclines back fairly far. Well, father than it looks like it would in the pics. I will recommend this to anybody in my life who ends up needing a guitar rack in the future."
1039,355,4.0,"One of the best stands in the industry!  Fits any guitar, banjo, or even a cello. Good construction and easy to put together.How can you beat that!"
763,355,3.0,"I got 2 of these for my Electric guitars.  They do indeed work, and the stand legs are decent.  DO be careful when un-folding as pinching of skin would be very easy.  The guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy.  The guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well.  I have had no problem with the foam cushion so far (I have modern finishes on my guitars  I don't think I can put my guitars in their gig bags on these stands which is a bit disappointing.  My Epiphone LP seems a bit more tippy on the stand than the Turser Strat knockoff, but that is more the design of the guitar than the stands fault.  I also like the little rubber grommet keepers they include. All in all these aren't bad.  Not quite perfect- but a good value for the money."
1071,355,3.0,"Good little stand to hold your guitars.  They function well and are inexpensive.  The only downsides are that they are a bit light, best to place them near a wall, just in case you bump them. Also, it seems that every one that I have ordered (Here and MF) have had the foam a bit crushed up simply could be the packaging from the manufacturer though. Do not use these (or any other foam for that matter) on Nitro finishes.  Good product at a Great price."
384,355,2.0,"does its job just fine. simple and kind of cheap looking and its hard to balance if you have it on a rug (and not even a thick rug...I have a thin rug and it still is unbalanced, but hey, its not really meant for rugs so I can't complain)"
558,355,4.0,"I now have two of these (really wish now I had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase -kicks self-) and all I can say - you simply can't beat it.  I also have a Hercules Tri-stand (10x more expensive than this one), and between the two, gotta admit, the only major advantage my tri-stand has is saving space (which actually is a huge consideration for me).  I honestly don't know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stands I currently own never once have given me an issue (aside from bodily running INTO the thing), and they have held/do hold a variety: Guitars of various styles, Banjos (both open back and BG resonator), Mandolas, anything with a long neck. All in all, unless there is some specialized stand need, I would first come to Musician's Gear."
725,97,3.0,"This is a great item because it is small, lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere (guitar, mic stand etc.) At the same time, because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don't pack it carefully when traveling etc..  The clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong.  The clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than 1-2 sheets of paper on the clip board. This doesn't happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig, day etc.  For this price it's a good buy in my opinion and with a little care, you will get more than your money's worth out of it."
814,97,4.0,It is what it is. Works. Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it.
1017,97,2.0,"These a cheaply made with corrugated plastic, however they are surprisingly durable. THESE ARE NOT 8.5x11 (paper size). They are about half-sheet size."
527,528,3.0,"could use a longer  cable  but it does work as it was suggested, and would purchase again if I needed to."
1276,528,4.0,This is a good working dependable power adapter and works flawlessly with my tc electronic guitar ditto looper.No complaints with this.
1029,528,2.0,you will want this to save your battery's when there is no power around not much more to say good luck
535,528,4.0,"Right product at the right price.  I have 20-25 of these dang things layin around cause I never throw them out.  but never fails I need one I don't have(to drive a zoom pedal to save on batteries), and here it was."
1037,528,4.0,"Nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn't work.  Well,....that's not the case here.  This power supply is well made (durable) and performs to the specs supplied.  I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration,...but why go to all that trouble?  This product lives up to it's calling.  Besides, who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner (Planet Waves) when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget.  I gave it a 5-star rating because the price is fair, the product is well made and works, and it was shipped well within the promised time.  By today's standards, that's as good as it gets.DP"
296,528,4.0,This is what these things should cost and this is how they should work.  I will be trying this out in a chain of effects (as the single power supply) so I will report back if it cannot do that.  Works as expected for 1 to 1 pedal power.  Enough said.
971,528,3.0,"I have had a few converters purchased at electronics stores over the years and none seem to stand up to the vigorous use placed on them by the road. I have not had this long enough to know if it will, but so far so good..."
333,528,4.0,"This product has a simple function but if you need a 9V adapter, this is the one to get. I trust the Planet Waves brand."
878,528,4.0,"nice and fine product  working for many hours with no degradation of the sound , no too much heat and easy plug for instant job"
729,528,2.0,"From the moment I started using this, I noticed a radio signal overlay when used with my mini amp and headphones."
279,528,4.0,I plugged it in the outlet. Plugged it into my Fender Mini Tone-master Amp. I don't need to worry about batteries any more.
1356,528,4.0,"I'm only running two pedals, so I'm not sure how far you can push this, but it's working fine for my setup."
1304,528,4.0,"I bought this using Prime and am happy with the power supply. I have many different makes of power supplies. In the end, they are all the same. Proof of this lies in the Boss unit I have owned for 20 years.Amazon had the Planet Waves 9v supply for the lowest price, lower than local retailers and if you do not use or need a &#34;1 Spot&#34; this will not let you down. I may order more to use with some of my older pedals not on my board."
980,528,4.0,I got this for my Line6 Pocket Pod. It works great so far. and was way cheaper then the line6 adapter!!!!
660,528,4.0,"Instead of shelling out over $25.00 for a Line 6 A/C adapter for my Pocket POD, I decided to give this one a try out, and I'm glad I did! It's well made, works great, and saved me quite a bit of coin in the process. Can't beat this one for sure :-)"
1091,528,4.0,"I bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers. Thus far, I am very pleased. Some of my guitar effects require at least 320 milliamps, which this adapter handles with no problems. I have heard no hum or noise from the adapter, either. It does its job reliably and well. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
367,528,4.0,works well with every pedal i tried so far. Can't ask much more than that from it. It was the easiest one on my wallet here on Amazon. go for it if you need one (or 2)
474,528,4.0,I needed a 9-volt adapter to use with an Danelectro N10B Honey Tone Mini Amp.  This was recommended and I am happy with the product.
459,528,4.0,"Ok reviewing something's I just don't see the need. Ok that being said , I searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedals...this came up first and is IMO all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons. I dont know what else to say..... The cord isn't very long but not overly short either, I have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc. ok for now that's all I got, I may edit later on down the line."
76,42,3.0,This works well...A few cons:1. it is not variable speed. on/off in either direction with full torque. Not so bad... but variable speed would have been nice.2. it is a little loud.Other than that... does what it should as expected.
1037,42,3.0,"Here's what you'll need to know about this product if you're interested in getting one.....1.  The 'head' accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config.  That's a good thing.2.  The trigger is a rocker switch..... so you can wind and unwind,....quickly.  That's a good thing, for the most part.3.  It is not variable speed.  One speed.  FAST RPM!  It takes some practice and patience.  Nothing special, just the will to get used to it.  Initially, and until you get used to it, you'll have the head jumping off the peg.  Don't 'fret' (bad pun)... a few minutes of rehearsal with it and you'll get to like it.  I've opted to pull the trigger in short bursts so as to refrain from having a string change remind you of a NASCAR tire change in the pit.... and especially because when you get close to the desired tension you need to go slowly so as not to over-run it.I would have much preferred a device that has a two-position switch.... 'slow' and 'fast' position on the trigger for more control.  I've rated it 4-stars, not 5, not because there is anything 'wrong' with it or that it doesn't work.  It does all that the advertisements say it will.  It's the aspect of the device I had to find out the hard way that keeps me from giving it a 'perfect' score.All in all, be patient and all will be well.  Realistically, I don't need to change a set of strings in just a couple of minutes.... I've got hours if I chose to.  I suspect most folks are in the same position.  If you're a 'roadie' for a big group, I could see the need,...the need for speed. But, alas, I'm not.  So, like some of the other things I've purchased along the way, I now have a new toy.  I works.  I'm satisfied...... for now.DP"
339,42,4.0,I'm so glad Ernie Ball decided to put out this tool. I've been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill. The reason I never did was that I was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose. This is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners. I love it!
164,42,3.0,I frequently restring mandolins and 12 strings so obviously it's a huge convenience. Even if it doesn't save a WHOLE lot of time it's very ergonomic. Wish it had more speed variance but it's great for the price!
374,42,4.0,This makes changing strings of breeze I was using a hand winder for many years.Unit takes four AA batteries but is very powerful also has a lock on it so it won't accidentally be put into a drawer and engaged.Looks to be quality made just what the doctor ordered.
226,515,4.0,First things first. If you have one or many expensive guitars BUY THESE. They keep you guitar safe from falling. To take it off all you do is hold down a button in the side and your strap and the lock with pop off. It's very handy. Very very easy to install and protects. Be warned they are bigger than they look but to do what they do so well they must be big.
1339,515,3.0,"I had the ones that came with my strat which I believe are Schaller's. I like the security of the Schaller's better because even if the pin is pulled they aren't going to let your guitar loose. However, my problem with the Schaller is that it would always unscrew the neck screw. I had to tighten it after every other use and let me tell you, not a little loose, but a lot loose.With the Ernie Balls, there was no redrilling which is needed with Strap Lock and the EB's screw is good and long. You also don't have to put them together like the Strap Lock, which is a bit of a pain.These have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern. I'd have rated 5 stars if the plastic you push together to insert and release was knurled. That would make it easier to grab and use. These will now be my default locks. The quality of the nickel is very good, too."
426,515,4.0,"Earnie Ball's guitar strap locks are great. in my opinion, the best there way over other brands like Dunlop, Schaller and many others. I have them installed on my Les Paul Axcess and my Jackson Dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging. You can definetely trust them to do their job. They also look great. Highly recommended."
157,515,4.0,"My Les Paul is heavy.. The strap would constantly fall off. So I decided to get a set of strap locks. These installed in minutes, and really dont change the look of the guitar at all. You will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap. If you dont have locks on all your guitars, you cant interchange your straps easily any more, so I recommend getting them for all your guitars. The other added benefit I found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back. With these locks the strap sits away from the guitar, so it fixes that problem as well. When I buy a new guitar, I get new locks. Are there better locks out there? I'm not sure, but Im committed now as I wanted the same locks on all my guitars.. Has never failed me yet."
939,515,4.0,I've found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by Schaller and Dunlop. These look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strap.I use them on a PRS SE 245 and I did not need to do any additional drilling. The screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure.Highly Recommended.
396,515,3.0,"These  work great! It's hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time. You have a strap. You have a guitar. This locks them together. But, these do work really well. Compared to other brands, I find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers. Downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered (by me) to be aesthetically pleasing. But, this is true for most strap lock systems. So, I say go for it!"
1116,515,4.0,"I had looked around for strap locks for my Dean Dime Razorback, and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them.  My guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage.Then I saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation.  I installed them last night and could not be happier.  They are very solid and the lock is 'positive' so you can feel the click when it is set.  I am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well.  This is a great product at a good price.Note:  If you are installing on a Dean Razorback or ML, the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate, body into the neck....DO NOT USE this to mount, or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw...it is too long and will likely split your neck.  Just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it (it can touch it even and still function properly).  Enjoy!  I really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and don't worry that I will hurt my favorite guitar."
658,368,2.0,"Have not used the light as much as I thought I might, but it works okay. Each light has multiple, independent settings. The beams are narrow, but you get two of them.The major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag. Something in the bag will trigger the switch, and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it. There is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transport.Also, you cannot really tell from the product picture, but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects. It does not work well (or at all) with object more than 1/4 inch thick."
264,368,4.0,"this light is exactly what I needed! very bright and great battery life, AND it comes with power cord unlike some others where the cord is $10. more .  we are an acoustic duo and play out on a lot of decks  at bars and restaurants and this is perfect, lights the music book nicely a definite must have"
681,368,4.0,"I bought this for my hercules fold up stand and it works great. There are 2 light sources and each has a choice between 1 or 2 lenses for brighter or softer light. The plug-in accessory is great, and my pedal board has an outlet. It runs fine on batteries also. Very pleased."
1006,368,4.0,"These are great,  have 3 of them now. I use them when I play with my duet and sometimes with the band. Used to plug in, but the batteries last a good while so I rarely use the cord anymore (there are enough cords in my life). I use a 3 ring binder with lyrics and fake chords, these light up everything pretty well. Only complaint - the clip isn't the best, but it's never fallen off or anything like that. Will but another one if any of them die, great product."
269,368,4.0,"Not as bright as I would like them; however, very nice.  I can practice without lighting up the whole house.  I'm glad that I bought it."
75,368,4.0,"Super, Excellent for dimly lighted rooms.............serves it's purpose really well and I plan to keep one of these handy from now on. Thanks for good quality products at a fair price."
679,368,4.0,"This had to be designed by someone who understood the need for well-placed lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing. the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light 'just right' over two open pages. The battery operation is nice if you want to be portable, but I have found that the AC adapter (Mine came with the light, check to be sure you get one with yours) is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day. My Duracell batteries ran down quickly, over a few weeks before I noticed the light becoming slightly less and less. The AC adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness. The whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of. I needed to buy an extension cord as the AC adapter cord is only about 6 feet long, and while that sounds like a lot, by the time you lay it out where you want it (out of the way to avoid tripping) you might need to add an extension cord too. I understand the LED's themselves last a long long time, so that is good, they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there. All in all, these do the job, illuminating with a pleasant easy to read-by light."
506,368,3.0,This light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely.  The light from the LEDs has a blue tint to it. I'd prefer something more 'white'. Each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting. I gave 4 starts because it doesn't get quite as bright as I'd like but it does the job.  It seems well-made and will operate off battery power as well as an AC adapter which is included.
1203,368,4.0,"This Mighty Bright is  great!!!!  It clips to my music stand, has battery power or ac adapter ( included) and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare. If you need a light for reading music or for just reading, this is it........."
1259,368,3.0,"I already own aMighty Bright LED Book Light with one lighting head, but I bought this light as a semi-permanent fixture on myDocument/Book Holder, which is mounted on anarticulating arm(took a little DIY'ing).This music light has one drawback; it doesn't have a master switch. To turn on both lights, you would have to independently turn on the switch atop each light head (two switch presses). To turn off both lights, you would have to independently double-click each light head (four switch presses) -- the first press brings the light to a lower level and the second press turns it off (each light head has two light levels: bright and medium-bright -- for a total 4 illumination combinations).I use this light for music sheets, documents, and books. The &#34;mighty bright&#34; label is no misnomer to be sure; these lights ARE mighty bright. They provide more than enough illumination to make even smaller texts readable in low ambient light conditions. Each light head provides very even illumination for a letter size sheet (the light starts to get dimmer just beyond the fringes of the sheet), so two light heads will provide sufficient illumination for a good-sized area. It will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books. The flexible goose necks of the music light allows you to easily position the lights to reduce glare (which is inevitable on glossy or semi-glossy pages).This music light is a mighty sweet deal because:(1) it comes with anAC Adapter(which doesn't come with the book light with a single lighting head and has to be purchased separately). The adapter works on both this music light and the book light with a single lighting head.(2) contrary to the product description, this music light DOES come with 3 AAA batteries (at least mine did).Important Note: If you switch from using batteries to using the AC Adapter, the 3 AAA batteries will first have to be removed from the battery housing or the light(s) won't power on.I picked this music light over theMighty Bright Orchestra Lightbecause:(1) I've had my single head book light for many years and I trust this book light to offer the same durability (both lights are indistinguishable save for the single/dual light heads)(2) two goose necks offer more lighting flexibility(3) this music light is about half the price of the orchestra light.---The Bottom Line: The lack of a master switch on this music light makes turning on/off the lights somewhat of a hassle (an unfortunate but tolerable drawback). All the same, this music light is very functional, and as far as durability is concerned, I'm quite confident that it will last me for many years to come (it has the same build quality as my Mighty Bright single-head book light, which I've had for many years). Recommended!"
435,368,4.0,"This is a fairly compact &#34;must have&#34; accessory when working in pit or dim light situations. This music light will easily cover two pages of  music and at a stretch, three pages.The LEDs provide bright , white even coverage making it possible to see the pages of music. The heads are easily adjusted with the flexible mounting arms and the two stage light intensity switch is a good feature when a lesser intensity light is desired.The small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling."
558,368,3.0,"My home practice area is in a rather dark corner with limited room, and I have this clipped onto my music stand. Illuminates the music far better than the previous ones I had used, including one that used a full sized bulb (rather too much light and not very portable). Have no trouble that others have mentioned, just it loses a star because the included ac adapter cord is *short*, making it for all intents and purposes useless to me without having to string along an extension cord to my music stand (ugh, more cords)."
47,464,3.0,I expected this to be a good mic but it's amazing how much different the quality is over your standard desk mic.
691,464,4.0,"I use this microphone mainly to record music. Occasionally I use it for voice chat where it supposedly excels in quality compared to desktop USB microphones. I think the best way to describe this microphone is that it is &#34;above average&#34; but does not outperform any higher-end non-USB microphones that I have played with in the past. While it is not an &#34;outstanding&#34; microphone, it's still a great entry-level product for those on a budget.The microphone is relatively easy to use (just plug in the USB cable) but it needs some accessories to be efficient. For instance, the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright. It seems like it will tip over if you breathe on it the wrong way. Remember to buy a solid desk (or floor) stand for the microphone, as well as a shock mount and a pop filter."
590,464,4.0,"I am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment. Paired up with a nice pop filter, this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings. You'd be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic. It took me some time to get the hang of miking amps, positions and vocal distance, but I am truly getting more than my money's worth for what it's putting out. Check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing. I am very glad I made this purchase.I've owned this mic for 2 years if you're curious about durability."
648,464,4.0,"I was looking for a better quality Mic but not willing to pay a high price to sing on the Internet.  This was a low price and high quality solution.  Nothing to load and I was singing right out of the box.It does pick up noise around me since this is a condenser mic but, that just means you pick a quiet place to record.. LOL"
418,464,4.0,"This microphone's quality is amazing. I just hooked it up to my PC (Windows 7) and it worked no hassle whatsoever. Nothing to install or hoops to jump through, just works great. I recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises. The stand that comes with it is very stable, but it is low to the ground (or in this case, desk/table) so it may pick up some unwanted background noise (computer fans, mouse clicks/movement, etc)."
185,464,3.0,I use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my iMac.  The simplicity of this mic is very nice.  The sound quality is also very decent.  I haven't ever used one of those 'professional' quality ones but this has not disappointed me so far.  The only complaint I have is that there is no 'On/Off' switch.  The only way to turn it off is to unplug it.  Other than that I totally recommend this Microphone!
986,464,4.0,"This is the best USB Condenser mic I've ever used.  I needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be XLR.  I bought the AT2020 XLR version, simply due to the fantastic results I've achieved with this one.I only use this microphone for podcasting.  I do not record music with it, but I haven't tried yet.  If you're curious as to the sound quality, listen to my podcast ""Rock Crushes Paper"" on iTunes and Zune Marketplace.Just to give you an idea of what I'm using:Windows 74 GB ramPentium 4 Dual core 2.2 ghzAdobe Auditon 3The build quality is fantastic, built like a tank really.  The only knock I have on this is the little tripod stand.  Yes, it's a tripod stand, but I can't imagine actually being in a spot where I'd rather use that then the On-Stage desktop mic stand.Anyways, great mic.  Can't recommend it enough.  It's made me check out other Audio-Technica products."
748,464,4.0,"works great, small and easy to place to the side and out of the way, simple setup, plug it in, change the preference settings and it works"
540,464,4.0,"I bought this microphone for youtube/podcasting and it does a REALLY perfect job. The quality is great for me. It was what I had expected it to be. I also bought a desktop mic stand with it, as well as a shockmount and popfilter. Highly recommended."
601,812,4.0,"these wires definatly change the sound of the snare, drasticly improving sound, as well as looks. very satisfied with my purchase"
960,812,4.0,"Shipped fast, sounds great and the price was way better than a lot of other places that i know of"
1188,812,4.0,Perfect chain for most rock sounds.Get the 28 strand for a thicker snap.I might try out the 28strand next year. I'm pretty happy with this one right now.The place I live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains.
1214,812,4.0,"This is a excellent Snare Wire, used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old Pearl Snare Drum, quick and easy to replace, came with straps to secure but did not use them as I prefer string. Improved the snare sound by 100%, no more rattle, snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound, well made product that did the trick. Product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures, if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect. Great Product at a excellent price."
233,491,4.0,Used this to dress up the Saga tele kit I bought on Amazon. It fit perfect and gives the Fender name to a Saga kit guitar. Don't think I'll fool anyone but what the heck.
180,491,4.0,"It fits perfect on my MIM Stratocaster, enhancing the visuals of the back. The ""Corona, California"" on the back ads a nice touch when you compare it to the other Fender ""F"" neck plate."
603,491,4.0,"I was going to get the plate with the big ""F"" on it, but I read complaints that it was very thin, so I kept looking. I took a chance and got this one, and it was a good call. This one is very thick and solid, like it's supposed to be.Great product, great price."
957,312,3.0,"I have not tested other micro amps, this does for what I bought it for, to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport, it's very portable to take with you. I really like the overdrive sound, the tuner works really well, I dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel, but overall its a great product, so if you need a good tone, and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try, it's great."
1025,312,4.0,"I've been a musician for most of my life, playing primarily keyboards recently in the studio and with bands, saxophone and a little bass guitar. I've owned a six string guitar for 20+ years that has seen very little use. I had this misconception that my hands &#34;just weren't designed to play guitar&#34;. But recently my life changed a little bit. I have a young boy that's now master of my universe, a lot less room to leave musical gadgets lying about, and I now live in an apartment building where making a lot of noise tends to be frowned upon.I picked up this Micro Crush because I was originally looking for a micro Marshall and I saw this pop up. I knew I already liked the sound of Orange amps (better than Marshall given my druthers of musical taste) and for $69 it seemed like not much of a reach to try it out for myself.Shortly after a small package of value came to me with this charmingly tiny amp in it. My son's mom thought it was a toy &#34;it's so small!&#34; Yes you might think so until you plug it in. The idea here is to sound loud without being loud. This amp is perfect for that.Most of the time I have this thing turned up to about 1, 1 1/2, rarely up to 2 or beyond. I've got a simple effect chain going in: EH Soul Preacher (compressor/sustainer) -&#62; MX Analog delay -&#62; Cheap (but pleasant) Chinese Phaser -&#62; EH Holy Grail -&#62; Amp. I use this as my &#34;clean&#34; sound without the overdrive. It is beautiful. A little Dick Dale-ish. Then when I want a little edge I turn off the phaser and delay and turn on the overdrive. Maybe nudge down the volume a little more and I can rock AC/DC licks at midnight without raising complaints from the neighbors. And it sounds ... BIG!No this is not the same as actually BEING loud. For one thing your ears won't ring. The cops won't come knocking to serve a noise complaint. Knickknacks will remain on their knickknack shelves.  The dogs won't howl.But should you desire to rock out at midnight in your apartment building this amp fits the bill.So much so that I, the man with the hands &#34;just not made for guitar&#34; now have guitar callouses, a lust after a couple $1.5-$2k guitars one of which will soon come home with me and frankly a love for playing the guitar that I never had before in my life. This all because I can just set up my little rig next to the couch and it's always there. Always ready to go. So I play while I'm watching football or baseball. I play while I'm watching the news. I play while I'm playing Crazy 8's with my son. I play morning, noon and night. Not only that but I'm actually getting to be not-that-bad at playing either. Lots of playing/practice seems to inevitably make on better (hint: do those finger exercises too, they work).So I am not exaggerating when I reiterate my headline: this little amp changed my life (for the better).Best buy for under $100 I've made since I bought my son his Strider balance bike. Which is orange too!"
1178,312,4.0,"This Orange Micro Crush amp lives up to it's name. It's little bitty, about a third the size of the Roland Micro Cube, but it's plenty loud. Surprisingly loud really, it's amazing that much sound comes out of that thing. Of course it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Micro Cube, it's basically got a clean channel, an overdrive channel and a tuner. Then a volume knob a tone knob and that's it. The over drive gives a good sound but I like to run pedals through it anyway. It's missing reverb, which I would like to have, but it's far from a deal breaker.I have no issues with the build quality, it feels solid as a rock. Of course it's size and trademark Orange color make it look like a toy, it's definitely a capable little amp. Definitely a keeper!"
967,312,4.0,"I was surprised at the sound that this amp produces.  The build quality is top notch.  Tuner is right on, overdrive seems fine.  I'm not an overdrive player.Cons: so far none and I don't expect any."
985,756,4.0,"I'm very satisfied with the performance of the CM-2.  With a few tweaking, I could emulate the sound I get from my Fulltone OCD.  I'd say it's very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low & high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the ""Tone"" control.  A toggle switch lets you choose between ""classic"" & ""modified"" setting.  A tweaker's delight!  The ""level"" knob has a lot of juice.  If you set it at 10 or 11 o'clock, it's plenty loud enough.  Although you can't use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the ""gain"" knob to zero.  If you have a single coil, it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up, not so for humbuckers (too much gain).  You can also stack the CM-2 with other pedals.  I dusted my old Boss DS-1 and run it along with the CM-2 and was able to get some good tones.  The DS-1 usually hurts my ears but with the CM-2 behind it, sweet!  The Hardwire CM-2 may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from Klon, Zvex or LovePedal, but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost.  It's well built, will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to.  There may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good.  Try it, you can't go wrong!UPDATE:  Did a full comparison between the CM-2, Fulltone OCD & Joyo Crunch Distortion.GAIN:  Joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the CM-2 and OCD, 3rd.MIX:  The CM-2 has the most amount of control with separate high & low controls, followed by the OCD with just a tone control and the Joyo Crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control.  Since the CM-2 has the widest tone range, I can make it behave like a Treble Booster!NUANCE:  The OCD cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic.  The CM-2 is a close second and the Joyo Crunch, being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind."
389,756,4.0,"First, I don't like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my Fender Blues DeVille 410 sound distorted, they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal.  There's a difference. Think about it if you don't get it.Second, I don't like having a lot of pedals. I play in a rock/country band were we play music that sounds like Neil Young, Tom Petty, CCR, etc.  Just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of 1,4,5 chords and an occasional minor 6th.  I just want an overdrive (my Digitech Bad Monkey) and my Arion tuner, but I need distortion when we do covers, AC/DC, Hendrix, etc.  (The DeVille can do Hendrix, if you turn it up to 7.  But of course then it's too loud.)Based on those criteria, the DigiTech CM-2 is PERFECT.  The Classic ""overdrive"" setting allows me to sound like Hendrix or rocking Neil Young (or any other rock band from the 60s and 70s).  The Modern setting allows me to sound more like 80s and 90s rock, e.g., Guns 'n Roses and Soundgarden.And this is important, both settings make my amp sound like IT is being overdriven.  It sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point.  It sounds fricken awesome.  It does not sound like an amplified pedal.So I can use the Bad Monkey (I've reviewed it on Amazon if you want to read it) for boosting my clean sound.  I use the CM-2 if I want to play dirtier and for covers.  Two pedals (plus the tuner) and I can play everything I want.  I'm happy."
273,756,4.0,"If you're anything like me, then I know what you're thinking: Digitech= Digital, fake-sounding junk. Not anymore. The Digitech HardWire CM-2 finishes what Digitech began with the Bad Monkey, which is a great overdrive pedal in its own right. But the CM-2 offers tone quality that compares to the best on the market (and as a pedal maniac, I've owned wayyyy too many overdrive and distortion pedals, so in all humility, I know what I'm talking about) and flexibility that is rivaled by none in the market for anything close to the price.What makes the CM-2 so great is that, like several other reviews have mentioned, it's not just another tube-screamer clone. There is no distinct mid-range hump and slightly rolled off bass that tubescreamers (particularly the TS-9) are known to have. There is a lot of range to all the knobs; the level can add some serious boost, bass and treble knobs allow you to significantly change your tone if that's what you're after, or you can dial it to be more (but never completely) transparent. Also, the CM-2 has more gain on tap than most overdrive pedals; you can go from basically a clean boost to adding a surprising amount of saturation to your tone. Lastly, the classic vs. modified switch gives you the option of adding some gain and bass by switching from classic to modified.I've tested the CM-2 as both an overdrive to a clean channel Fender Hotrod Deville, and as a front-end boost to my Bugera 1990 (basically a Marshall JCM 900). The CM-2 sounds great in both applications. Over the clean channel of the Fender, it sounds very full and smooth. Even turned all the way up, the overdrive never sounded very ""grainy"" or fuzzy; it maintained warmed, organic, and tube-like. ""Boutique-esque"" is how I would characterize it. Great for blues playing, and I'm sure that playing with the tone knobs you could dial in some good country tones as well.However, I use it more as a front-end boost to my already-overdriven Bugera amp. In front of the lead channel, CM-2 serves to take my tone from hard-rock crunch territory to a more metal tone, with chunky bass and roaring highs that make palm-muted riffs sound as at home as if they were coming through a Peavey 6505.As a conclusion, I'm really pleased with the quality of the Digitech CM-2. Both the sound and build quality are top-notch, and for a price similar to or less than most quality overdrive pedals on the market, I highly recommend checking out the CM-2."
892,756,4.0,"This is the one pedal I can't do without. You can sculpt your guitar tone before it hits your amp, and that's the key to getting a tight rhythm tone at high gain. So if I encounter an amp that isn't tight enough, or the high gain distortion doesn't sound good by itself, I just turn down the gain or use a lower gain channel, and then hit it hard with this pedal. Sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion.Alright, so here are some things you might want to know before you buy:* The gain knob when turned to zero still produces overdrive. So you can't use this as a *clean* boost pedal. With high output humbuckers, you still get some mild tube-like overdrive at zero gain. But this isn't advertised as a clean boost pedal.* So how much gain / distortion does this pedal have if you're going into a clean channel of an amp?  Plenty for classic rock and blues. Not enough for metal, though if you crank the gain and high knob all the way you can just barely get a prog style metal tone. But it's not a distortion pedal, it's just an overdrive.* This thing uses tiny SMC components in the circuitry and therefore isn't really moddable.* Unlike the Bad Monkey, this doesn't have an additional mixer / cabinet emulated output.* Like a tube screamer, it boosts the mids and reduces the bass so that going into a mushy sounding tube channel you get a tighter distorted sound. Anyone who has a nice warm amp and gets this pedal thinking they'll get more of the same, may be disappointed. What they need instead is a transparent clean boost pedal that keeps their guitar the same tone just louder volume.* The classic/modified switch is pretty cool. I have two guitars, one is kind of bassy and scooped sounding, the other is bright and middy. Well, using the switch, I can make one come out more equivalent to the other when needed. This keeps me from adjusting my amp each time I switch guitars. Classic is a slightly lower gain, more mid-boosted sound. Quite tight. Think Peavey 6505 EQ structure. Modified is more scooped, saturated. Think Mesa EQ structure. So this switch is a useful little bonus.*  It eats batteries, sucking in around 150 mA at 9V, so my 300 mAH rechargeable lasts 1.5-2 hrs. I swear if that blue LED weren't so bright it would probably get an extra hour. Instead of getting an adapter, I got an 8-battery AA clip, 9V battery clip, 12V DC plug, and 8 Sanyo Eneloop batteries. Hooked it up with negative tip, positive sleeve and now I have a 16,000 mAH monster = about 100 hours play time.This pedal is perfect. You get what it's advertised to do. It's rugged, looks good. I haven't found it to be noisy at all, unless there was something wrong with my guitar (strings not grounded through the bridge, etc...). Someone mentioned the silver tops of the dials falling off as if they were decals, but I looked and the knobs seem like all one solid piece to me.Another thing I found is that instead of using an overdrive plugin in my DAW, if I use this real overdrive pedal in front of my interface, that magically makes all hum / noise from my pickups go away.Overall, yes I highly recommend this, and would suggest people check out the Hardwire Metal Distortion if they want something as a standalone rather than an overdrive into a crunchy amp. Like others, though, I can't stop playing through this. Great purchase, especially if bought used."
504,756,4.0,"The CM-2 is magnificent: [1] It produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone). [2] It has independent ""High"" and ""Low"" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation. [3] It features a switch that allows you to pick between ""classic"" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion (""modified""). [4] The case is made of metal. [5] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal. This pedal will not give you ""metal"" distortion; for that consider Digitech's TL-2. Instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone. I love this thing!"
264,496,4.0,"this cup /bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water....(or adult bottled beverage) while playing. seems sturdy and doesn't get and condensation on my pedal board due to the neoprene , great product"
251,496,4.0,"My musician friends notice, and wish they had one. As a flute player, I whet my whistle so to speak a few times during a performance, and this keeps my water bottle near by.  The cup is flexible enough to handle different diameters of cups.  I imagine it would hold beer too."
963,496,4.0,What can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do. I used to put my water on the stage an 1/2 the time kick it over. Now it's right where I can find it everytime.
289,496,4.0,"This cup holder clamps on easily and really holds your drink so you dont have to worry about it. The insert part is made out of thick material so it will smash down when you pack it up. You dont really notice the name on both sides at gigs, just a cold beer in front of you thats always in the same place! I love it."
1343,496,3.0,"In my band, we have a song where I use a kazoo for one song and I needed a way to store it until needed. This cup holder does the trick. It also holds my water bottle with no problem. The problem is it doesn't do both at the same time. That's on me; this is a good product for what it does."
409,292,4.0,"Yeah I kind of bought it on a whim, it's confusing as hell first of all. I don't really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described. :)"
426,292,4.0,This is a very useful and quite educational musician's piece. I especially like the way it is presented and how easy it is to use. It easily helps remember all possible scales and shows many tricks for your musical compositions. Highly recommended. Cheers!
532,292,3.0,"I love this little device!I'm an amateur musician so I'm on and off on playing. I play enough I need to know theory, but not so often I don't forget the specifics.This gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tab.I don't believe this is a tool to teach people music theory, but it is a wonderful reference once you know what you're looking for.For example, I'm playing with the harmonica now. Simple little instrument right? Well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major, minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and blues scales in 12 different keys! One section of this wheel lists all of these different scales. Rotate the dial to the key you're interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key you've selected appears. Nice.Although I play guitar, I find the other side of the wheel less helpful. Yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords (MmmMMmD)but they are barre chords based upon the ""E"" chord. If you understand the formation of an E barre chord and its family (E, Em, E7, Esus, Esus4, etc), this may not be so helpful. I really don't use E barre chords much beyond the 7 fret as I usually switch to the ""A"" type barre chord based off of the 5th string so my hand has much less distance to travel. I've not found anything to support these ""A"" type barre chords nor the others: D, G, C.I find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance."
1117,292,3.0,Tons of useful information on this wheel. My only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written. Seems like reasonably durable construction. Compact enough to stow it in a guitar case.
957,292,4.0,"The only complaint that I have is the instructions they are kind of shallow, if you have musical theory background you should not have much trouble, I'm no expert I have a some knowledge beyond basic, and it's really helpfull to take some reference learning new things, visualize quickly chords, scales, mayor and minor scales, you can view there relationship it's a great tool to learn, if you have deep knowledge maybe you dont need it. For complete begginers it might be difficult to start without reading and taking time to study. This is a great complement to study theory."
433,292,4.0,A good tool for study and applying to your music. Keep on hand to help understand theory. Also great for those starting out learning an instrument.
1173,292,0.0,"This is a fantastic product that is well made. The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful. I have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. With the wheel, I immediately know what chords to choose from. I also know what notes are in each chord. In addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. For example, say you're playing the I, IV, and V chords in the key of C., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb. All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb, find out the new I, IV, and V chords, and start playing. The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. This is a very useful product at a fair price.No, I am not affiliated with the company at all. I'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion, this is a five star product."
415,292,3.0,"I'm a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords. This wheel has made if fun to find chords that work well together, its quick and easy to use."
1258,292,3.0,"This educational device is truly an asset to all musicians, especially guitar players.  Because it gives complete scales, and notations at a moments glance I find it extremely helpful when my hands are busy, but my mind is wandering."
521,292,4.0,"I'd suggest that this is not for beginners. More for the intermediate musician. It is not something you are going to understand at first. The learning curve is moderate. Other than that, quite useful and durable."
871,292,2.0,"I am confused by this hellish portal of confusion. Looking at it makes me ill - I feel like it's laughing at me, with its indecipherable scribbles."

If you're boss, you need the Info.-Austin Powers?"
1256,868,4.0,"Let me start of by saying this tuner is great.My previous tuner was a Korg CA-40 and frankly, that tuner is terrible.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.What made me get a new tuner is how finicky the CA-40 when using the build-in mic. The needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner. Yes, it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability. Another issue with the CA-40 is the poor screen. The screen is so dark and only viewable head on.The CA-40 does not have any of the flaws of the CA-40 and is even more accurate.What this tuner has: accuracy, usability, durability, versatility. What more can you ask from a tuner of this price?"
94,868,4.0,"Over the years, I've literally owned dozens of electronic tuners...generally five or six at a time in various locations...ranging from a $12 Musiciansfriend promotional item to a $200 rack mount. Most have been in the $30 range from Sabine, Yamaha, Korg, and Seiko. The Seiko SAT800E is my all time favorite because, like Mama Bear in the fairy tale, it affordably splits the difference between ""too small"" and ""too big"". It stays put on the floor when I run it inline between my guitar/bass/uke and my amp and its LCD display is large enough to be legible when I'm standing. At the same time, it neatly fits in my ukulele case. Beyond that, it simply does what good electronic tuners do, accurately and without fanfare. Bravo."
857,868,3.0,"I teach class guitar in a community college and bought the SAT800 to loan to students during class. I selected it for the rubber bumpers and beefy build, expecting anything in this day and age to nail pitch quickly and accurately. And, indeed, it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching. Oddly, in one year of use, nobody has dropped it so the bumpers also provide a sure grip in hand and on music stand. My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times as much as the SAT800 but managed to hit the deck several times a week. Amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students. However, the display was larger and sported colored note names, so it was more intuitive for beginner use.The built-in mic works fine in a quiet room but is useless in a classroom full of guitars (as are all built-in tuner mics). You need to use a tuner pickup and all is well (I use a Korg tuner pickup). If I were to nick pick I'd have to say the letter name of the pitch is way too small on the LCD. It's tucked in the far right corner in 12 point type and positioned just after the octave number. A lot of students can't read or notice such small type. Also the octave number immediately in front of the letter confuses many beginners as they assume it is the string number (doesn't matter how many times I explain that it isn't). Finally, it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch. Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets it to A435 or whatever and causes a bunch of other students to be out of tune. A lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade. Most of these nick picks don't apply to pros or advanced players but are something to consider if you're a novice.Add a calibrate safety feature and double the pitch name size and this would be a 5 star product. Right now it's a mere 4.5!"
1355,889,4.0,"It's a pop filter. In case one wasn't good enough, they double it up! Works great. No complaints whatsoever. No need for a fancy pansy $50 metal mesh screen. This works just as good."
1249,889,4.0,"Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone. And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more. It's simply amazing. Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter. If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves."
598,889,4.0,"Works exceptionally well. In fact, this works better than regular, single-layered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice.Well worth the money. The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands."
924,889,4.0,"Very nice pop filter! I use it on all my condenser mics! It works perfect for those hard P's and strong S sounds. It's built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand. It makes DeEssing a lot simpler when mixing vocals. And it looks very professional! I wouldn't be on the mic without it, now that I know of the big difference it makes having it!"
1237,408,1.0,"When set on blink, they blink way too fast.  When not set on blink, all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white.  Useless design."
123,408,4.0,Very bright! 4 of them are great for lighting up the front stage of a band which is my application for them! Worth the money!
289,408,2.0,"I own the older Color Bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one. I love the size, weight and LED bulbs on this one though. It has a nice color throw too. It also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but........this new LED version is built with less quality. When you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings, the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one, about every second. They do not stop flashing when it's plugged in since it don't have an on/off switch. If you are using this on a switcher, then it wouldn't be a problem.I'd prefer the light to stop when the music stops, but it don't. When you try to adjust the audio flashing, it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation.Also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back. They will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around. Within 1 hour of getting it, I had to take it apart, push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place.I love the light but it's not as useful to me since it's ""always"" flashing. It's possible I have a defective one, not sure.The cool bright LED bulbs are the best part of this light.***UPDATE,  I played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better. When you turn it all the down, the lights stopped flashing until the music started again. The one I have never stops flashing, even when the music stops. I guess I got a bad one."
389,240,4.0,I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo.  It works.  It also came with a cord.I was not happy the Super Champ X2 didn't come with it.  Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches.  And you really need the foot switch to use the X2's various voicings and effects. Now the X2 is my main amp.
822,240,3.0,You need this to get the most out of your Super-Champ XD amp. The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic. No telling how long the switches will last? Fender tends to make good products. Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO.
1312,240,4.0,"Works great with my Fender Super Camp X2. Easy connection, easy activation of switches, immediate response. Small, light and compact. Great product."
436,284,4.0,"I'm a guitar, piano and bass player, as well a private music teacher.  I also received formal training in guitar-building and have been commissioned to build instruments for amateur and professional musicians.I ordered this ukelele on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon, and I was pleased with this instrument when it arrived.  I was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size.  It's only about 19"" long (approximately) with nylon strings, but it really puts out a strong volume and really nice tone.  It has geared tuners, not peg-style tuners that seem to go out of tune easily.Although I've never played ukelele, I was able to play songs like Brown Eyed Girl, Old MacDonald Had a Farm, and Do You Wanna Dance in about a 1/2 hour using the chord book that comes with the book.  I did this drawing on my guitar-playing knowledge.Also, my daughter, who is a piano player and 11 years old,  picked up the ukelele.  In about 15 minutes was able to play Row Row Row Your Boat, which is in the instruction booklet which comes with the uke.  I see this as a good buy for beginners and a good starter instrument for young children who might like to move over to guitar eventually.Two concerns though -- mine came with a couple small dents in the back of the ukelele -- nothing major, but I could see them -- looks like someone hit it on something.  Also, most stringed instruments go out of tune for a short while after you put new strings on them.  This one wouldn't stay in tune for more than one song when I started playing with it.  I yanked on the strings to stretch them, kept retuning it and playing it, and it would still go out of tune.  This is improving, and I'm trusting the reviews here that say it goes out of tune ""at first"".  I'm expecting the tuning problem to disappear as the strings get stretched and the windings around the tuners tighten out any slack.[note:  Two days later, after about 8 hours of playing the instrument is staying in tune better and better; I expect the problem to correct itself as the string get stretched]The little 5-page booklet has basic chords and songs--  Row Row Row Your Boat, Are You Sleeping, He's Got the Whole World in His Hands, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Amazing Grace, and When Irish Eyes are Smiling.  There was also a blurb about a famous ukelele player who authored the pamphlet on how to play the Ukelele and is the founding member of Louisville Ukelele Association Unlimited (LUAU!)-- a ukelele band.Overall, I'm happy with this ukelele, and fully expect the tuning problem to go away with use."
1419,284,4.0,"This was an impulse buy.  After playing the guitar for many years I thought a ukulele would be a fun addition, and I was right.  This one proved that you don't have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument.  It has a great sound, appears to be good quality and well made, all for a very reasonable price. At first it didn't seem to stay in tune for more than a day, I decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months.  If your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot, this is a nice instrument."
242,284,3.0,"Although I purchased a Lanikai LU-21 ukulele some time ago, I have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours.  Despite that, I've been highly impressed with its quality and sound.  As some reviewers note, nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp; however, that's more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele.  The Lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard, although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general, it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range.  The tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well.  If I were going to be playing gigs, I'd probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument (and I probably would not purchase it without trying it first), but for having some fun, this is a workable and recommended instrument."
802,284,4.0,Great ukulele! Very light which is nice. Intonation is spot on looks beautiful too.A perfect soprano ukulele for a beginner or an experienced player looking for a nicelooking affordable ukulele!
1067,284,4.0,"I play a few stringed instruments, and ukulele isn't one of them. But after seeing so many great uke players lately- Jake Shimaukuro, Joe Brown- I had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself. I wanted a playable instrument, and I didn't feel like spending a lot of money. I've tried $30-40 ukes in stores that were big disappointments- bad intonation, no tone, etc. After reading reviews here and elsewhere I decided to risk a purchase.Result? This is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks. Sure, it doesn't have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top, but it delivers good tone, excellent intonation, and good playability at a very good price. It may not be a 5-star intrument- but it's a 5-star value.If you're thinking about trying ukulele, but you're not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away, I would strongly recommend an LU-21. Even after you buy a better uke, this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests, so that you can play ukulele duets!"
493,284,3.0,"I don't have experience with toy instruments, but have lots of experience with better quality ones including professional and semi professional ones. I'm not a ukulele player, and this one is for my daughter, whose high school ukulele club features players with a variety of instruments for me to compare this one to.I found this one to be made well enough that it plays well. The frets are properly aligned, and the instrument stays in tune. Notes played on alternate frets are in tune as well as I would expect relative to each other. The tuning issues others have mentioned relative to break in periods are no different from what you would expect on violins or guitars, and are perfectly normal.Although this plays well, I was disappointed with the workmanship. Since I did not see similar comments from others, perhaps mine is not representative. But the workmanship is somewhere closer to the level of lower quality instruments I've seen of other types.The finishing quality is not out of line for the price range, but does not approach what other reviewers have led me to believe. The wood is not properly finished where the neck meets the body, and there are clear sanding marks in the wrong direction. It looks as if it had been finished in a hurry by somebody who had no intention of doing a quality job.A less important issue has to do with the grain. Normally, instrument makers will try to line up the grain with the direction of the body. On mine, the grain is at a slant, giving the impression that the neck is slightly bent. It's an optical illusion, but not a sign of higher quality instrument making.The workmanship issues are cosmetic, and I'm still quite satisfied with the way the instrument plays. The finishing issues will not be visible when being played, and the tonal quality is about what I'd expect from an instrument with such a small resonating chamber. Perhaps there are better sounding soprano models out there, but at this price point it's what I expect. If you are disappointed and want something better, expect to pay at least double."
155,192,4.0,I ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great. It has a realistic feel to a piano and appears to be made of quality matterial. this pedal works great and make my keyboard sound great
800,192,4.0,"I love it.  It works great.  No ambient noise or clicks, as some have suggested.  It's as easy as, you plug it in and/or flip a switch for the desired effect, and voila it works.  So, duh, why do I need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject.  Just buy the product and get on with happy music making.  Thank you On-Stage."
516,192,4.0,"I have used this pedal on both myRoland RD-300NX Digital Pianoand myRoland V-Combo VR-700and it's one hundred percent compatible with both. One nice feature that ensures compatibility is the polarity switch that enables it to work with just about any brand and model keyboard.It's well constructed and I have not encountered any issues with the two-piece bottom. In fact, after over a year of use on carpet issues reported by another have not surfaced. If anything this pedal is as good as new.The feel is superb. There is positive resistance as you depress the pedal and the spring tensions it in such a manner that you can control exactly the rate of depression or release. It is not so tight as to fatigue, but the response is positive.Another feature I love is the six foot cord length - it gives you room to place the pedal when you have tiered keyboards and multiple pedals on the floor. The cable itself and the plug look to be high quality and have withstood over a year of constant use with no problems.If you are looking for an inexpensive, but not cheaply made, pedal that will work with just about any keyboard this one is worth considering. I am sold on it and would replace it with an identical pedal if something happens to this one."
1289,192,3.0,"Received the unit, plugged it into my Alesis Q25, tested it in Logic Pro X and it works fine. The pedal itself is solid, nothing more to say, happy with purchase."
791,334,4.0,This saved med at least $40 instead of getting a traditional pre-amp. Best invention ever!! Also portable. Downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but I keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff.
712,334,2.0,"Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product."
1067,334,3.0,"I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here, but the warranty, Blue's reputation, and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try. And in general, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound, no hum, and so far, excellent reliability. I'm using it with Audacity and a few other programs, none of which have any difficulty recognizing it. There were some issues setting it up initially, and I'm a bit leery about the plastic construction, but for what I paid I think it's a good value. For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag, and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector. You shouldn't have any problems."
318,334,3.0,"I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58, or similar ""dynamic"" microphone.  But its claim that it will convert any ""condenser"" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a ""plug 'n play"" USB mic should not be taken at face value.  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one.  But make sure there are return privileges."
659,334,3.0,"This transfers my XLR mic to my USB laptop. Simply plug it in and find the right drivers. My only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic. It does seem like it can break easily. Thankfully I will never have to move it around much on my desk. All in all, it works and I am pleased."
208,788,4.0,it is lined and has a pouch for song books.  Great price and great product if you are looking for a soft case this is a great option
777,788,4.0,"I will just say that in my opinion, if you are looking for something to take your Taylor to a gig in, you are better served with an SKB. In a sense, the case should mirror the guitar it will hold. However, all that being said, this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars. It is well crafted and cheap. I use it for my Ibanez Exotic Acoustic Electric. A nice guitar, but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two. Anyway, i also store some extra picks, my strap, and a couple cords in the bag (along with a fretboard cloth, a set of strings, a tuner, and an allen wrench for the truss rod). All in all, great value for a good item."
141,788,3.0,"It fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection.Storage compartment could be larger, but good for extra strings and picks.You can&#8217;t fit a full sheet of paper or an 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221;paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment.I would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarCross straps work well for carrying. Zipper system works well.It is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price.It fits my Jasmine ES31C Dreadnought Acoustic-Electric Guitar just fine.You really can't beat it for the price."
1221,691,4.0,"I bought this for my Takamine EGSF15SC acoustic/electric guitar and it fits snugly and does the job very well.I am very happy with the low price I got, and am very pleased with the overall quality of this case.It has exceeded my expectations."
1334,691,4.0,It works for what I need! It arrived earlier than I expected! Really nice! My guitar is safe now with this hard case!
862,691,3.0,"The case is very nice and sturdy. It has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come. The inside is very nice and soft with a big pocket to put things in it like picks, tuners, capos. It also has a lock on the case in case one might need it. This is a very good price for a case of this good of quality and I highly recommend it."
690,691,4.0,"great case, didn't really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about. holds my seagal s6 very well. great guitar by the way for the price. but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy. the padding is done very well"
442,691,4.0,"This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date. In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it. My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it, no bumping whenever I carry the case. The only problem I have is it smells terrible! But that's fine; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable. Other than that, this was a great investment!"
69,691,4.0,"I ordered this hard case for my Fender T bucket. It fits exactly like an original fender hard case. Looks like made of good materials. Very well built. With interior pocket to put your accesories like capo, string winder, etc. I Love it. For its PRIce and Quality,I giving it a 5 star :O).."
1135,449,4.0,"This is a great capo from shubb. The finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel. I like how it works. It adjusts to fit different guitar necks, and just sort of snaps in place. It doesn't require great force or a lot of hand strength to use this capo. The rubber parts are replaceable and with a name like shubb you know you're getting a good product. I recommend this capo to anyone."
293,449,0.0,This capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar. If I position it just so it will work as long as I don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side.
202,449,4.0,"This capo works very well!It applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design.  The rubber seems to hold well - it's a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time, but I've had no issues as of yet.My guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capo's design.  I also have a quick-change Keyser and I can say I prefer this one for practice sessions, but the Keyser for performing.  This one is too slow for the stage."
483,449,4.0,"I did a lot of research and I finally found the right capo.. It is a little bit pricey, but you get what you pay for...It is made from a very good material and I have been using this for years!!..There are some others capo that are less expensive, but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar.. This capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension.. I like this and I highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level. Good Luck."
1230,502,4.0,I bought two sets of these for two of my Fender 4x10 bass cabinets. I slipped them right in using the original Fender screws since they're machine screws (EB comes with wood screws). Very solid.
1266,502,4.0,"if you can drill into wood with a 5/8 wood drill bit then these are for you, I bought mine for an amp 1/4 stack and now when I record I can simple roll the head and Cabinet into the small room and record...you get 4 in the package with 4 wheels and 4 retainers thats 5/8&#34; thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet...."
936,502,4.0,"Quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any Ernie Ball products,great, very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces, not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces. I have them on several bass cabinets, they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use."
466,502,4.0,"My Hartke 410VX Cabinet was designed by an idiot....9 million pounds and no casters...not even holes for them. Who invented this thing, He-Man? Anyways, I bought these casters, got out the drill, and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp, pounded these in, and now it ROLLS. Sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when I push it like a car missing a wheel. But its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing. Of course, we practice at the drummer's house and in his basement so I still have to carry it down and up his stairs, but that's life."
1159,502,4.0,Great quality casters for the money! Just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps. You can't go wrong with these.
152,162,3.0,"I use to use a cloth to clean my strings... this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool.Easy to open, clamp on the strings, run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer! The only thing that I worry about is running the plastic over the frets. I understand that it's only plastic, but I wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time...I don't know... if I see an issue, I may update this a year or so down the line.Until then? Excellent solution!"
682,162,3.0,"I give this product a 5 stars in terms of the idea, but a 4 or less in terms of the materials used to make it, especial the outer plastic shell. The cloth in the sandwitch which does the cleaning is a good and fare material. All and all for the price it's a 5 star. Good idea to clean the strings (especial metal strings) without damaging them or the guitar itself."
1000,162,4.0,I chose this because I wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings. So far it has worked beautifully.
426,162,4.0,"This is a very useful little device. I use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar. It removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately. This will increase the life of your strings. Don't expect miracles, but this helps quite a bit. I have bought this for me and several guitar-playing friends that have found this much useful. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
1076,162,3.0,"This is great idea to clean guitar strings. I've always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the top.Simple to use, small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensive.Using this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time."
762,162,3.0,"First of all as a former touring guitarist and a guitar tech junkie, I have a tool box with every tool you can imagine.  I have to say this string cleaner is a must have!  I say this because in the long run, it will save you money on strings, save you time with changes, and will keep your strings sounding alive.Most guitarists don't realize just what they are doing to their strings when they play.  You are leaving behind a world of sweat, dead skin, and all kinds of nasty elements.  The oils/fluids you leave behind can be very acidic and contain plenty of things that will build up and corrode your strings.  I've seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead.  I've seen mold and and all kinds of garbage build up on strings so bad I thought a sloth may be living on it.  This little tool will prevent that.I have a routine with mine. Before I play, I run the cleaner over the strings a few times.  Whenever I'm done playing I make sure to spray a string cleaner fluid onto the pad and run it over the strings again until I feel they are completely clean.  You will not believe the extension of your string life or the quality of sound you will get following these cleaning practices.Someone has mentioned in their review the fret damage that the string cleaner caused and I too thought about that the first time I used it.  I suggest pulling up a little bit so that the cleaner does not touch the frets.  Toward the nut where it is hard to get the cleaner in, I just wipe down with a rag.  This is a great, cheap, handy little product that all guitarists should keep in their pockets."
950,162,3.0,I had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things. Needless to say the strings were at least 5 years old and I was about to replace them with new ones but thought I would give this a try. I am amazed at how good the strings feel now. They really are like a new set of strings. Saved me 20 bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves. My only reason for knocking off 1 star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be. They could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done.
1245,162,2.0,"I was not to thrill about this product, I really don't have anything super negative to say but nothing super positive either,"
622,162,1.0,Just use a cloth or paper towel.
379,162,4.0,"Pretty cool gadget... a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles, cans, or sprays, and does on a set of old strings."
548,162,3.0,I bought this since I am a new guitar player...It does hit the frets but doesn't seem to do any damage...Pretty easy to use.The only oddity I have is that the box was kind of open already when I bougt it new.Does the job.
1108,162,2.0,"It sorta cleans strings but not fully, i dont even really use it anymore, i feel like i wasted my money on this item"
1388,601,3.0,"After returning the Pedaltrain Jr (too small), I received the Pedaltrain 2 with Soft Case, and it fits the bill perfectly. I am using a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus unit, and had some minor issues getting the plug-ins to line up with the cutouts on the board itself. As the other user here mentions, the cutouts on the board are slightly too close together. You can center the Voodoo in such a way to make sure both plugs are useable, but the overall install is not 100% in-line.I did not run into any connector issues mentioned by the other user review here, using the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus system. All connectors that came with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus, fit perfectly, and there are no clearance issues. One quick PRO-TIP: Leave the Connector Brackets slightly loose when installing your Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus, as this will let you make fine adjustments, once the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus is dropped into the back of the Pedaltrain. Once this are lined up to your liking, or as close as possible, based on the narrow cutouts, then you can tighten your brackets screws all the way down, and then use a punch to mark your indented drill holes. There is a pretty decent video on Youtube by Pedaltrain, which will help with the process. My only small complaint is that they don't use a center punch. You should always use something to create a starter divot, especially when working with soft metals.Overall, this is a great pedalboard. I am running Boss TR-2, Boss OD-3, MXR Dyna Comp, MXR Phase 100, Dunlop Crybaby, EH Cathedral Reverb, and EH Stereo Memory Man w/ Harzai, and there is plenty of breathing room. Nothing is cramped, and there is plenty of space for patch and power cable routing. The board I received came supplied with plenty of soft-sided velcro. There is another review here where the user states they didn't receive enough velcro. I cut 4 22&#34; strips for each of the cross bars, and still had about 6&#34; of soft-sided velcro left over."
1066,601,4.0,"I've been playing guitar for over 30 years both teaching & performing and never used a pedalboard. I used to carry the FX's in a briefcase and setup the ones I needed. I'm old school when it comes to these boxes... I run compression, wah, overdrive, super-overdrive, delay & reverb pretty much in that order. Sometime I use a phaser or a tremolo... I also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but don't use them much. I currently have 8 pedals setup on this board. I have room for one maybe two more. The board itself is built like a tank and travels well. The bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but I wouldn't take it on tour without a metal case. I did go ahead and Velcro down all the pedals that I always use leaving a little room for add ins. Be sure you want to Velcro down the FX chain because to get the best, most secure, it won't fall off the board when you pick it up off the floor...I found that I had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal. The Velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals. Use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them. Low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned....Boss, MXR, Mod Tone and other high end, well made pedals work best once set on the board. You can run any number of power sources to it. There is plenty of room for all my needed connections...I leave the choice of that to you the reader.At the end of the day it's easier for me to move my FX pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes. Plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable.. I'm very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it."
1194,601,4.0,"If you are familiar with the Pedaltrain products, you know how solid this product is. If you are new to effects, it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick (they have a deal with Voodoo so those bricks are will always fit). Keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets, they are not predrilled.The duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable. If you have a power strip, it won't fit around the edges of the bag; the fit inside the bag is snug. That said, I have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables."
1175,601,4.0,"This pedal board replaced a bcb6 boss case because I have a lot of non-Boss pedals and wanted to start using them for gigs.The PT2 footprint is large enough to accommodate a lot of pedals but not too big for a smaller gig, except some of the smallest ""stages"" (room corners) that do require a smaller rig.Without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case.  I wrote the company, described the problem.  Lizzie wrote back and said she'd take care of it. You just don't get better service than this company provides.  Combine that with the great product design and I'm a happy customer.The larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath.  This is one of its best features.  Truly plug and play.  Yes, I spent more than I ever have on a pedal board before.  Portability.  Reliability.  Flexibility.  If I was ever going to use my best pedals for gigs, this was it.I have tried SKB and Furman and they have some nice features, if you like a lot of plastic.  I still like the PT2 much better."
769,601,4.0,"I had a custom-made pedalboard, made with wood also, it was great in therms of protecting my pedals and with the space but maan it was heavy, only with 7 pedals and that was getting me problems with my back and shoulders... with this i have 13 pedals and i wont say that its not heavy bcuz it is, but is the same weight but i got 13 pedals!! Thats a huge difference.... the only thing that i maybe dont like is the bag, i know it wont last A LOT OF TIME, but in general is the best pedalboard ive had and i wont change it.. maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain... the best"
1361,601,4.0,"Once you place the pedals on it, it's kinda heavy...but it won't hurt your back. I arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly.No brainer, built to last and the carrying case it's outstanding.Cheers!!!!"
1383,601,1.0,"My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased."
178,601,4.0,Comes with all the Velcro you can need Very simple to set up even for me ( a newbie)I got the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2  to go along with it Although you have to drill 4 holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple.
884,601,4.0,"This product is great. You can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals. Read the description so you can have a sense of size. Tue quality is very nice, solid and resistible. The soft case is very nice also."
1297,601,4.0,"Tried several of pedaltrain in the past (pt-3 too bulky, and pt-jr a little to small), this one holds my pedals perfectly. Simple & light. I love it!"
631,533,1.0,"From the product description, I expected something far more robust than this unit. By and large, I've had great experiences with Behringer pedals, but this reverb unit is the wimpiest I have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w First Act amplifier."
494,533,0.0,"I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that doesn't have built in reverb.  Put a battery in and plugged it in.  Very simple.  But the sound was horrible!  No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear.  The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful.  On the other hand, the reverb from my Korg AX-100G (that I was using on another rig) was great.  Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly, but I don't think so.  I think that's the way it really sounds.  So I got a return authorization from Amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.JM Tepper"
52,533,2.0,"I ordered this pedal based on the previous 2 reviews, but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap, plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust. I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping. To me, it wasn't even close to as good as the Fender amp reverbs..."
746,533,3.0,"Behringer usually makes good stuff and this Reverb Is No different but what It does best Is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb Nothing else. I wanted this for Singing and I have the Danelectro FAB Echo which gives a short distance echo but I wanted something without the slap back and this does what I want It for but Not quite as much depth as I wanted but with The Music I do Not think Anyone can tell. If You want a good Reverb that Is above average with much depth then get the Behringer RV600 Not this. The power supply I use Is Danelectro which Is great, I also have a godlyke that I use."
1389,533,3.0,"Yes, it's cheap plastic.  Yes, the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours.  Yes, the battery is difficult to replace.  However, this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet.  I solved the battery problem by using a 1-Spot 8-outlet pedal power supply.  It doesn't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest.  Everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here, and it all sounds great.  It even has a ""modulated"" reverb, which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only (not the dry signal) which is their version of the Holy Grail's ""Flerb"" setting.  This is about 1/3 the cost of the Holy Grail, and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use (unless of course, you are an elephant).  For all the complaining I hear about this and other pedals with ""cheap plastic cases"", I have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it.  Behringer pedals are hit and miss, but this one is certainly a hit."
1340,533,1.0,"This ""would"" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb"". What the hell was Behringer thinking???"
1154,61,3.0,"I bought this as for practice. I have a $180 amp, but was looking for something a little more portable. This is what I came to.It has great distortion, the effect is pretty awesome too! The lead cuts clean; &#34;mostly&#34;. In general is does tend to get a little noisy though. However. For the price, this is probably one of the best steals ever. Like I said, I have a &#34;sort-of&#34; name brand amp that is estimated at around $180. I can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp. Until I can afford a REALLY good amp, this will be my primary one; and really I have no problem with that.Pros:-Cheap Price-Fair sound quality-Nifty Built-in Effect-Can plug into AUX letting you play with musicCons:-Cheap ITEM quality-Distortion can get &#34;messy&#34;-Not very versatile...Metal ONLY.I hope it never breaks."
1093,61,4.0,"Amazing! I plugged this little gadget into my Strat, put on my headphones and wow I was super surprised! The sound is amazing. You can adjust the amount of gain and volume to fine tune your sound whether your playing through humbuckers or single coils. I love the sound I get on either my Strat or Les Paul. Best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody. I plug this little monster into my compressor and from the compressor to the guitar and the sound is amazing. I really like the sound and the fact that it is totally portable and independent of power (runs on two AAA batteries). The digital delay effect is activated independently, (same little switch just one extra click) which is fine, but you can't adjust the speed or mix. That's OK though because the factory setting works just fine if you want a touch of delay. All in all, I highly recommend this Vox AmPlug Lead Guitar Headphone Amp for its sound and price. One small con, its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile."
1299,61,4.0,"For what it does and how I use it, this is the hot setup!  Great for a quick practice and really sounds nice.  Wide overdrive and tone range.  The delay feature is basically a simple slap-back echo (I'd much rather have a chorus in there) but for price and the sound I'm quite pleased."
1204,61,3.0,"works very well.  I have to of them.  each does a little different thing,  they are great for traveling, or late night need to play stuff, when the rest of the family has no interest in your desire to get better.  the sound, effects, etc., are adequate and are good as you need without the real amplication."
394,61,4.0,"I have to say I was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but I was shocked at the sounds I could get.It took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone I wanted and off we went.For the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone  is worth twice as much.As far as durability I have had in a month used it 10 times, so far so good.I did purchase the protection plan for $10 so I'm covered for 2 years."
186,61,2.0,"I was a bit disappointed in this gadget.  It just doesn't have the quality sound that I expected from the material written about it.  I've had much better luck with a simple interface between my guitar and iPhone or iPad.  That arrangement isn't as compact as this Vox product, but the sound is much more pleasing."
32,590,4.0,"i do like this for playing at home, but it is what it is is by no means a replacement for my 15&#34; tnt peavey but works as it says and the shipping was quick"
1210,590,4.0,This is a good product. The construction is pretty good. It will give you a variety of bass tones. You have to buy a 1/8 trs to a 1/4 ts adaptor to line out to your amp or sound system.
557,590,4.0,"This little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand, but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even. Its 1/4"" TS plug goes directly into your bass's instrument cable jack, and it has one 1/8"" TRS output jack for your headphone plug. But it also has a second 1/8"" TRS input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp3 player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over play-alongs or any such music source, both directly into your headphones.Its on-off switch has a third position for overdrive distortion, which I never use. It has both gain and volume output controls and both work. It also has a tone control but I cannot discern that it does anything. Could be that I just have a defective sample, but I don't care because the tone is fine just as it is.Others have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile, and I don't argue with that--it does feel a bit thinly made and the 2xAAA battery door does seem weak. But I just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag. If the battery door eventually falls off, I'll use duct tape, and when this little thing completely wears out, I'll buy another. It's just too handy and easy to travel with not to own--and, as I said, it does the job.EDIT 2013-04-07: Still working fine."
1301,590,3.0,"Liked the sound, the adjustability, just wish I could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way! I find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid. I don't care about disturbing the neighbours, but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling, the Rumble 75 is a bit big to take everywhere. I made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must."
604,590,4.0,"This device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices. Armed with a set of headphones, I can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my MP3s (mp3 player plugged in too!).Worth the small price you pay.As far as construction, the battery door BARELY hangs on. I'm sure if I drop it, even from a low height, that door's flying off along with the battery."
584,590,3.0,"Sounds just like an amp in your headphones! Gain, Tone and FX switch make for a broad range of sound since you won't be able to use any pedals. This is a great little piece of kit if you have some fun money to spend on it. 1 star off because, while nothing fell out, the plugs on both the bass and headphone side are very loose feeling."
851,762,4.0,Onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things..  I use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary..  I put them on a mic stand and it takes much less room than a full blow tripod..  They can't hold a heavy camera very well but a small one they will hold just fine..
640,762,4.0,I use this often to record my band's gigs. Now if they would make one that will hold a PAR 38 can so I can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks!
1331,762,4.0,"Works well, pretty straight forward. A little over priced for what it is, but, sure beats having to purchase another complete stand."
810,762,4.0,"Bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied. I am not having any problems fastening to a stand or cam corder, and I am able to clamp the swivel lock very securely. I am only using for light-weight applications. Certainly worth the $7."
324,762,4.0,"I was skeptical after reading the reviews, but the manufacturer must have read the same reviews because these things are solid and the glue that holds the rubber piece seems to be holding up well. No issues with the screw not tightening either. I plan to buy more of these in the near future."
1415,762,4.0,I already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well. It was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where I need it. Holds Zoom recorder as well with no issues when I am recording. This works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod.
294,762,1.0,The plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesn't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag. it's a great idea but not well executed.
226,390,4.0,I usually use fender .73 picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while I was playing and it was very irratating. So I picked these up. I no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand. The star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it. Hands down the best pick I've used.
453,390,4.0,"I used to use the Tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these.  I ended up using that pick for something like 3 years (playing 1-2 times/wk).  Once I started playing 4hrs/wk at my church, I decided that this pick had proven its self so I order a small box.  I have never dropped one of these and have never broken one.  FYI: I generally don't play hard and I always play acoustic, Nanoweb custom lights."
1007,390,4.0,"First saw on YouTube video, how genius? A pick that stays in hand... Makes me wonder how ever played without them...Small price for big help!"
247,390,4.0,I say this one is more between a Fender Medium and heavy. But it has the star for grip and that is super. Hard not to like. Get some!
15,24,4.0,"I simply love the cradle from Jim Dunlop (although a little pricey).  First, the material that the neck rests in is very soft.  Overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar won't fall off of that skimpy little 3 legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this Planet.  I did find it to be a little short to support my Ovation Acoustic Bass, but a small length of 2 x 4 fixed that.  Second, it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which I need to get into the back guts side of my Ovation."
1000,24,3.0,"Very good and very useful device. Very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do, very very well."
1277,24,3.0,Definitely holds the guitar well . a little pricey but probably worth it. I'm a fan of Dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one.
295,24,4.0,"The Dunlop neck cradle is well designed and firmly supports the neck of any guitar. It is self adjusting and makes restringing a breeze!  Buy one, and I am sure you will like it as well as I."
395,24,4.0,"This is what I have needed for many years. Really well made, very sturdy and will last forever, and it is useful for all the Guitar work I need to do. I think it is reasonably priced as well. Thanks for a great product and good prompt service Cheers !!!"
631,722,2.0,"if all you want is amp-like vibrato and chorus, here ya go, and it's cheap and cool looking (bigger footprint than a Boss pedal). The 'Hue' control gently affects the tone."
820,722,4.0,Moen pedals are great.  Nice quality at an unbelievable price point. This pedal is no exception.  It is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch.  to be fair I have not tried many other vibes.  Hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal.  That being said I am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere.  vibe is very Trower like. Think bridge of signs.  Chorus is on the mellower side. Very analog sounding not digital.  Replaced my BBE mind bender and fits the bill so much better.  Solid well built and should last.  I would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues.My only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect.  I read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led's would fix the problem and indeed it did.  It's been fine since.  Despite this needed fix I would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if I needed to
176,722,2.0,"look this pedal doesnt cost a arm and leg, but as far as other vibes and chorus pedals this pedal falls short. but I wasnt looking at sending alot so it gets the job done"
1345,722,4.0,"Rugged pedal by a little known company. Took a shot in the dark, hit a bullseye! Great univibeish/old chorus device. Would like to see stereo output options in future models. Solid. If you have a Strat, have studied Jimi, then it will suit you well if you've got the right physical approach to the guitar itself."
1068,598,3.0,"decent, holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles.  the bag's shape from side view is a rectangle -- compare to other stand bags that's more of a square. Zipper seems to be very good quality, the bag is NOT padded at all, and the material used is very thin, there is however a water resistant coating on the interior of the bag.I think I should have spend $10 extra and got the on-stage padded stand bag.  But if you are going for local shows and doesn't need the extra padding for air travel, this is the bag to go."
516,598,4.0,"I purchased this for handling convenience more than any other reason. I useOn Stage SS7761B Tripod Speaker Stands, which are light duty, but awkward to carry. This case solves that problem. When I mentioned light duty in the title, I truly meant it. While I gig twenty times per month, nearly all are totally acoustic, with a small powered speaker for rooms where the pianist/vocalist has to project over a grand piano. On very rare occasions do we need a full PA, and that is where this case comes in handy. Moving individual speaker stands from my vehicle to the performance area is awkward. Transporting them in this case isn't.These hold up beautifully if used three or four times per month when a full PA is needed. I am not sure I would want them for the heavier, all metal speaker stands because the weight would quickly wear the case out. It has reinforced stress points, but I still feel those are not adequate for heavier stands.You can easily fit the two stands that I mentioned above and aOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand. The side pocket is good for incidentals like XLR to 1/4 inch adapters, patch cables and the like.Bottom line: this case is for occasional use only, and even then for lighter stands. I awarded it five stars because it does exactly what I need and is not touted to be anything but a light weight case."
810,598,4.0,"Just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of PA equipment on a cart. Aside from the two speaker stands, I can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand. Very simple, sturdy canvas construction, thick zipper, two sturdy handles. I don't expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart, so I'm assuming the stitching is more than sufficient. At $20, this bag looks like a great value."
1168,598,4.0,These bags are large.  I didn't realize they would hold large tripod stands.  My other bags were a lot smaller and sometimes the tripods would stick out the top.  It would have been nice if there was two pockets so two tripods wouldn't touch each other but this still works great.
435,598,4.0,"For the price, this 50 inch canvas bag is  great bag for toting around a couple of folded 9 foot light stands and miscellaneousbooms etc.I own other Gator products and have been very pleased with the quality and performance.Note that this bag does not have padding and does not have a divider but for the price paid, I still think it's an excellent bargain."
542,202,4.0,"I am extremely pleased with this amp. I purchased it because I was looking for a tube practice amp and this fit the bill. The numerous voicings and setting on this little gem make it worth far more than the asking price. Even though this is a low wattage amp, this sucker can get LOUD. The other reviews detail the exact specs much better than I could, so I will defer to them for that.However, this little amp packs a big punch when it comes to tone. I highly recommend it!"
1026,202,4.0,"Bought this as a supplement to my other amps (to record blues tones).  I first saw it in a big box musician's store while there was a ""blues guitar session"" going which is a public jam session open to anyone.  They had a lot of tube Fender amps plugged in.  I was surprised when I plugged into this amp away from that group, turned it up, and started playing... It sounded just as good as those other amps.  The two employees that worked there and two other customers couldn't believe where the sound was coming from... even the other players checked it out.  I don't understand how Fender has managed to keep this amp a secret for so long... poor marketing maybe?  I don't know, but if you want a blues or blues-rock amp with some great vintage tones, check these out.  Pick up a used one.They sound like a tube amp because, essentially, they are.  The amp sounds big and warm from the tubes, not thin and tin-like.  Has GREAT overdriven tweed, blackface, and bassman models.  A couple of the Marshall settings aren't bad either.  This amp sounds better than the Super Champ to my ears (tried this out at the store as well) which makes sense since it's a class A amp as opposed to class B... warmer and more articulate.The speaker is decent but this amp also sounds great using an external speaker cabinet.For home jamming and recording blues without driving everyone nuts, this amp is a God-send.  Check one out and you'll want it."
376,202,4.0,"Small. Light weight. Stunning Fender Blackface looks. Warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive. The digital voicing is direct and easy to set up. The fact that Fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me. It is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio. The direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself. What could be easier? And it mikes well too, by the way. The choice is yours there.With no LED display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too. The voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates. The Tweed, Blackface, and Marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp.Love the reverb in the FX section. The spring reverb is so well done that I bumped the amp once and was looking for the ""spring chrash"" known from amps with the real spring reverb. It's that good. Once again, the controls are easy and direct. Never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort. Who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? You want that, go waste your money on a Line 6 or something. This Champ is made for one thing. To give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort. I believe it has accomplished that well.Again, a shame that Fender has dropped this model from the line up of products. The super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well. I'm just glad that I got one of these from Amazon. com when I did and will not part with the amp. Been playing for five decades now and I know when I have a good instrument or gear and when I don't. This model is a keeper to be sure. And I don't even like digital! How's that for an endorsement? It's that good for what it does...."
1179,202,4.0,"I got this for $150 dollars when it was on sale. I don't like 8 inch speakers for gigging, but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a PA. The 8 inch speaker is okay for practice, and it has a jack for an external cabinet. Be careful with the load you put on your amp though."
230,202,4.0,"I've been using a very cheap amp for too long and decided to try a tube amp. This thing gave me chills the first time I played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after I unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first ""you wasted our money on this"" which turned to ""dang this thing sounds good guess it's ok with me"" as I begin to shred on it with my p90 equipped les paul..The tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic, and for 5 watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue, though I don't think it is loud enough for a drummer. It has line out and speaker out which is great, and this amp has nice build quality. Plus it's on sale right now so snatch one before they're all gone. I would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device. Note that this thing takes about 15 seconds to warm up so you can't just flip it on and play instantly (not a huge deal, just turn it on before you get situated). I wish they could have crammed a 10 inch speaker in it, though the 8 inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient. So stop thinking about it and just go buy it!"
888,400,4.0,Use them all the time.  Has velcro too.  Goes from my DI or preamp to my audio interface.  Good quality.
138,400,4.0,"Nice cables for the price. Nice to have a good name on them, and very useful for my band's mixer rack setup."

516,400,4.0,"My Instant Order Update notice shows that I purchased this in December 3, 2010, and during the time I've owned this cable it has been heavily used and is still noise-free and perfect in all respects.  For context I purchased it to connect a mic tube pre-amp to a mixer, so it has been set up and torn down many times in the past two and a half years.Key points that earn the five stars is the heavy duty strain reliefs, which keep the inside conductors from bending and stressing. I am guessing those are why this patch continues to be noise free and provide a strong signal.  Also, the XLR connectors are of the highest quality. In the past I have cut corners only to find that small details like connectors do not always mate well. Not so with these. They engage and disengage without binding or looseness. Bear in mind that they have been in frequent use - inserted and removed hundreds of times.The outer jacket is fairly thick, which to me is an indication that the manufacturer did not cut corners when this cable was constructed.Overall I am pleased because this patch has withstood a lot of use and has held up perfectly. I would not hesitate to purchase more of this brand and model if I need additional ones."
640,400,1.0,"The plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of VERY thin plastic, and cracked in two within a week of light use. I guess I can redo it with electrical tape to make it work, but I have many Whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years. I expected more from this manufacturer, but I guess the quality is not the same as it used to be."
1043,400,4.0,I bought this to &#34;daisy-chain&#34; two small Kustom powered PA cabinets.  Virtually all of the XLR cables available were way too long for my application. This cable filled the bill perfectly.
289,400,4.0,I buy many of these cable and they all test correctly with a meter and they all work great. So far I haven't had any issues at all. They feel well made and I will continue to use them for the bands PA.
1092,400,2.0,"This is a great xlr cable and does the job for what I need it to, which is attach my dslr shoe to an external shotgun mic.  It has low noise, clean sound/good transmission.  The only issue is that this particular cable, more-so than any of my other ones, is hard to get a locking click on anything it attaches to on either end.  Once it's attached it's fine, but then it's the same coming off, I have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried I'll damage a microphone.  With expensive equipment, I'd use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me."
1414,741,2.0,"I bought this guitar nearly a year ago. It was my first guitar. I never cared much for the sound. It always sounded out of tune, even when it was in tune. I eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this Squier. My skills are slowly improving but I wanted another electric so I sprang for a Epiphone Les Paul. Yes, it's 3x more expensive than the Squier BulletStrat - but it sounds 10x better.If you buy a Squier, I think you need to be prepared to make this a ""project"" guitar. You'll probably want to replace the tuners, pickups, bridge, etc.Or just buy a better guitar to begin with. At this price point you probably won't find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar."
1225,741,2.0,"Had it for about two weeks and I'm about to return it now.Things that I like(d):1. It's a classic Fender and I was looking for something of good quality with great price.2. Sounds clear and crystal good, unplugged.3. This can be subjective but I think this BulletStrat is more comfortable than a Les Paul simply because it's wider and thinner.4. All the previous four ratings here on Amazon and even higher ratings on Musician's friend.Things I don't like much:1. 15th fret of lower E string is dead, and like always I take quality control into my rating account.(I don't want to bother go to a local shop for a fix, never mention that's $20 in addition)2. I couldn't figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound (like not a bit)? (I'm new to electric but my Les Paul does change tunes... in a much much more obvious way)3. Talking about plugged sound, it's no where close to unplugged. Notes are pretty mixed up and not separated/clear, very loud though.4. I don't know if it's universal, I ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches. What's worse is, they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove... (I', not even sure if I can call it a protective cover because it's pretty weak and thin.)This is overall an OK guitar, consider its price it can be made at least slightly better. For beginners on budget with less than $200, I would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price. For example, me, I got a SX Deimos ($175) Les Paul which I'm in love with now. Simply everything about it is better, and I finally get the feelings of an electric. I'm glad I don't need to stuck with this anymore.According to Amazon,3 Stars - It's OK4 Stars - I like it5 Stars - I love it3 Stars Checked, it really IS just an OKAY guitar to me.Thanks for reading, and hope people find their beloved guitars!"
928,741,4.0,"I am so in love with my &#34;pinkie&#34;! I have been taking lessons using an electric acoustic guitar and I wanted to see the difference. This has a thinner neck so you don't have to stretch so wide, so it's easier on my hands. It's actually fairly light for an electric guitar and I went with it because it's by Fender and it does seem to have that Fender quality for the price. The only thing that I don't like is that it has a slight buzzy sound on the 6th string. I will know better when I take the originals off, but for now it wasn't a major issue."
94,741,4.0,"With the exception of the MC-1 classical, Fender has upped the quality of every low-end guitar it's associated with. The latest &#34;bargain basement&#34; Squier Strat Bullet is no exception. As other reviewers have indicated, a Squier Bullet...straight from the box...is ready to give guitars several times its street value full-on competition. But why stop there? If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I'm a serial hot-rodder. And THIS is my favorite 'victim'. Why? Because it's such a sound platform to begin with (pun intended).The basic stuff on the Bullet is very good...and for many, it's all that's required. But let's quest after some serious, big-league sound. The first things to upgrade are the pickups. The standard ceramic-magnet Squier pickups do yeoman's work, but they're wonderfully eclipsed by top-drawer pickups from Lace and Seymour Duncan. My favorites? A Lace Red Dually bridge with a single Lace Hot Gold parked half-way between the middle and neck positions. The Lace Hot Gold value pack with a Hot Gold Hot bridge pickup. And the Lace 'patriot' Red, Silver, and Blue value pack. You simply have to hear the difference these pickups make to believe it...and all you need to find out is a Phillips screwdriver, a cheap soldering iron, some low-temperature solder, a pair of wire-cutters, option YouTube 'how-to' videos, and some patience.But wait a minute, hold the phone...what about the stock pick guard? Please memorize this: Chandler Guitar's Pickguard Heaven. Better yet, Google it. They're wonderful folks and they do excellently-affordable work. With a custom pick guard, virtually ANYTHING is possible (e.g. how about a Seymour Duncan Dimebucker bridge?)!The next thing to do is to block the tremolo (whammy) mechanism. Proper vibrato comes from the fingers. Period. A small piece of oak from Home Depot, carefully whittled (not for the guitar's sake, but for your finger's) can be easily wedged between the guitar body and the die-cast tremolo string-carrier by removing (and eventually replacing) six Phillips screws on the back of your Strat. Hey, now you're Eric Clapton.If you want bold-as-brass sound, the stock plastic nut can be replaced with a brass Strat nut, a bit of careful filing, and a tiny touch of epoxy or Gorilla glue. Why bother? A more forward lead guitar sound. If you play rhythm, don't bother.Finally, if you're a monster about precise tuning and have basic woodworking skills, the very good stock tuners can be replaced with state-of-the-art six-inline tuners from several manufacturers. Note well: most folks will be more than well served by the stock tuners.So what's then point of all this? For the price of one genuine American Strat (which is a VERY nice ride if you can afford it) you can have three or four, arguably-equally-excellent Squier Bullets with a diverse mix of pickups and resulting sounds."
543,741,4.0,"My first Elec Guitar, I'm 60 years old, and this Guitar is PERFECT..If theirs better ones out there, then I can't wait to get one..I've got this one on a small 15 watt Amp, that's not a name brandAmp, and it sounds very good..So, needless to say I'm verrrrrrry happy, and love the blues and Jazz sounds I'm getting..B T W ...Who said learning the guitar was difficult..Piece of Cake, if u practice..Buy this Guitar, u won't be sorry you did..EnjoyJawbone"
1413,741,3.0,"The Squier Bullet that I have is actually the model without the tremolo, however, everything else is just about the same as the model you see above. It's a nice guitar for the money. Nice size, action, and finish. It's not a high-end guitar so don't expect it to sound like one, but for a beginner, it's pretty sweet. I bought a more expensive blues guitar and had planned on trading this one in or selling it, however, I like it so much, that I plan on keeping it as a back up. Parts are pretty easy to come by (with slight modifications, but that's to be expected) and fairly cheap too."
624,741,3.0,Great for a beginner electric.Needed new strings but everything else was smooth.Pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well.
1069,741,4.0,"It feels great, looks great, and sounds great. What more can I say? If you're just starting out, this guitar is perfect for you. Once you get better at playing it, you can customize it a bit more to your level of skill. Highly recommended."
1045,741,4.0,"This guitar just got stolen from me!!! Frikkin thieves, I loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands, it is super light, unlike my other gretsch guitar, so easy to take anywhere, it can handle some rough playing, its simply awesome, specially for what it costs! I am SOOOOO getting another one :D"
100,741,2.0,"Ok for the price.  Tuners old style not sealed.  PUP plate mal-adjusted and off quite a bit.  I'd suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions.On the positive, action and intonation good.  Better than expected.  Much better than most Chinese guitars at the same price level.  However, I've purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less.  That said, you'll probably do OK.Epiphone setup and overall quality better than the Squier."
816,741,4.0,"I initially wanted a Yamaha Pacifica 012DLX - Guitar Center in Eugene claimed to have stock in website - but when I reached there - there wasn't any. So I tested an Affinity and a Bullet HSS instead - and thought the Bullet was pretty ok - but they did not have the color I wanted. So I ordered through Amazon - but I bought a microcube from Guitar Center as I'm greatful for the opportunity to test guitars.I waited for 2 weeks before I make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression.I received the guitar in perfect condition - it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors. Just a few words SQUIER by Fender. New strings and scratch free. Made in China it says. However - it did not have sharp frets like I experience with some 100 bucks guitarsThe action came very high and I had intended to return it - but the guitar was perfect and I couldn't find any fault to return. So I proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps: 1)Straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod. 2)Then measured the string action height and set it from 1.5mm for the first 3 strings and 2mm for the last 3 strings. 3)Setup the intonation using a tuner. You really need a tuner for this step.After that, the guitar was splendid. It did go out of tune in 2 or 3 days but stabilized after that. I do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning.After 2 weeks, I'm still loving the guitar. Beginners be warned - you may like the action or may need to do setup like I did. In fact I'm so impressed with Squier that I'm thinking of getting the Squier Standard Strat next - pretty curious of the Alnico pups.Latest review:Downgraded from 5 to 3 stars.I bought a Washburn RX40 with Duncan USM.The bullet is nice but I outgrew it.The tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive.The bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings, Tusq nut, locking the trem down.. etc.I'd recommend to save some money and buy something above $200. Guitars at that price may be twice the cost,.. but is more than twice better.The 2 important things are not in Bullet: the sustain and the sound.Latest review:The product is back at 5 stars!I got the sustain to improve by increasing the action.Fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short.There some sounds that a Strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short...like attack finger plucking."
941,878,4.0,It connected well in the nady smps-x1 phantom power unit I bought! I'll update how I hook it up! Check!
308,878,4.0,I use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano (I have a pro model with XLR outs) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces.  Works every time.  Balanced signal is so much better...no more issues with ground loops or other problems.  Just clear as a bell.They were cheap and the build quality is fine.
970,878,4.0,"What makes a good cable?  One that works.  I've had these XLR cables fail because the pins get loose, so I hope this doesn't happen to this one."
676,878,4.0,"I needed a cable to go from my mic to the floor, just to plug in a delay effect (our PA doesn't have an effects loop).This is just what the doctor ordered.I just toss it in my gig bag with my vocal effects pedal and run the regular XLR from the pedal to the PA and I'm in business.[...]"
739,878,3.0,"It's working ok, not for hard useI just use it on my PC table for karaoke online.with phantom mic it's well done."
415,878,4.0,"I originally bought several of these cables to use between our DMX light fixtures. The day they arrived I happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so I tried one of these. The cable is soft and flexible and I could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable I had been using (that's a good thing, my other cable was very expensive).The connectors are not gold plated but it's an inexpensive cable, it's not pretending to be anything other than a decent low-cost XLR two-conductor shielded cable. It's working for me, I'll be buying more for our studio."
1189,878,4.0,"Good quality, well made. Its a simple cable, what can be said. It was a good deal, did the job."
209,878,0.0,"Often, we get what we pay for. After researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, I chose solid items for reasonable prices.I should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable. This item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one end, and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board. The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.Don't buy this item - spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand."
968,878,3.0,These cables seem to be quality-made.  I purchased them to go with my two microphones (also in the same Amazon order).I have yet to try them with my microphone.
1049,878,4.0,"Got this because I thought the length would be enough.  It was, but I wanted more mobility so went to the longer length.  Had no problems with this cable though.  Works great!"
108,758,3.0,"For the price I think it's hard to get any better than this.  I love this case.  It fits perfectly in the overhead bin on planes.  It's light and feels comfortable when you carry it.  Had mine for 2 years now and no complaints, still as good as new.  The look is not that inspiring, but it protects your guitar.  Some reviews are mentioning faulty hinges but I've had no problems with mine."
533,758,3.0,"I recently purchased a used American Fender Strat that came with the old tweed case...nice case, but doesn't provide the protection that I need for my guitars. The Fender/SKB case is built like a tank and provides great protection and it has TSA locks for when you travel. A no-brainer for Fender guitars."
593,758,4.0,"I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars, a Fender American Standard Strat and a Fender American Standard Telecaster. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in a Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section of the Gator case gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but with the padding loose, the Gator case is going to require some repair before it can be used again. Other than a couple of scuff marks on the SKB Fender case, it's as good as new.  I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on."
1018,758,4.0,"Sturdy - great latches - I love the handle - so comfortable to carry - nice and big so it fits your hand well.Not a lot of interior storage - but my Strat fits well - it is very secure inside.There is enough room inside for a strap and a cleaning cloth, a few picks and a set of strings - but not much else.My old case I could also fit a Boss TU-3 tuner - this ensures a thinner, lighter case.The case is also very well balanced with the guitar inside.If I purchase another Strat I will purchase this case again. Great case. Heavy duty. Rugged. Sturdy.** 10-23-2012 - still holding up well!"
1253,508,3.0,Acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one. It fits perfect and even though I'm not a huge whammy user it's nice to have for that occasional vibrato.

I firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return.

Lexi.. what the hell is the plural of Lexus?"
113,508,4.0,"Say it all, but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece.  A great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic Squire."
1219,508,3.0,This arm is a direct replacement for the original.....  It is a bit to long for my liking and I may shorten it down in the near future.
1405,508,3.0,"this tremolo arm needed to be bent outwards a bit in order for it screw down enough while still clearing the volume and tone controls, overall a pretty good purchase"
474,508,4.0,"It works as advertised.  Replaced missing tremolo bar.  I don't normally use one, but if I ever wanted to sell the Strat I would want to sell it complete."
501,577,4.0,"Background:I'm a gear-head, with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well.  Before my current set-up, I played a Fender Strat run through my effects into a Vox AC15.  The Vox sounded great but I had two problems: 1 - The all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig. 2 - At 15 watts, even though it was loud, I'd often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band, and as the tube amp increased, so did it's natural gain.  That would normally be sweet, but it would color my effects with a different tone, and often times leave me having feedback issues.Enter the Fender Frontman 212R!This thing has TONS of clean headroom, and it seems like it was built for pedals.  I can crank the amp or keep it quiet, and there is no tone changes done to my effects.  This is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom.  It makes it easy to dial in your sound every time, no matter what volume you play at.Secondly, it's Fender reliable (with a 5 year warranty).  No tubes means no tube issues.  Yes, it doesn't sound as good as the Vox by itself, but that's why I have pedals.Other things worth mentioning:It's not as heavy as my Vox (all tube) amp.  I can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another.It's got 2x12inch speakers.  They push some serious sound, and they have some low punch too.  My Vox had a better speaker, but the 12 inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes.  This amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down!My Vox may be a better recording amp, but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year."
145,577,3.0,"I have been playing for 9 years.  Have owned many different guitars and amps, tube and solid state.  Currently own and use...Marshall JCM2000 DSL 100 w/1960b cabMarshall MG half-stackFender Super Champ X2 w/Carvin cabFender Frontman 212rLine 6 Spider III 120 Watt 2x10Kustom 35 Watt Combo 1x12Out of my solid state amps, this one sounds the best.  In fact, this amp sounds great, gets plenty loud, is affordable, and is not some junk brand you have never heard of.  Has a great clean tone with a lot of low end.  Reverb sounds great as well.  A little overdrive sounds good too unless you use too much, gets quite noisy and loses its clarity.  Remember, this amp is NOT for metal.  If high gain is what your after, then stay away.  If you are into ANY other kind of music, then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price.  Also, unless your playing with a drumset, this amp is overkill as far as volume goes.  100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist. If you are into ANY other kind of music, then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price.  All in all this amp was a good buy and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range....But this wouldn't be a very good review without having some cons.  So here are mine.  These are by no means deal breakers but I find them quite annoying.POWER SWITCH IS ON THE BACK?-I find it annoying to have to reach around the back of the amp and feel for the power switch every time I turn it on.  It is especially annoying if you are like me and have limited space and stack your amps on top of each other.  With another amp sitting on top of my Frontman 212r, the power switch is even harder to get to.EFFECTS LOOP IS ON THE FRONT?-The last thing I want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere.  When using the effects loop, one has to deal with looking at two more wires hanging down over the front of your amp when they could be hidden in the back.  Not the end of the world but I just don't understand why.  Why Fender why?FOOT-SWITCH JACK IS ON THE FRONT?-This one is not so bad, but just adds more messy wires to the picture.REVERB IS NOT FOOT-SWITCHABLE.-Foot-switch includes ""Channel"" and ""Boost"" buttons.  A third button for ""Reverb"" would have been AMAZING.CAB IS MADE OF SUPER CHEAP PARTICLE BOARD.-Not that I expected anything different in this price range, but the ""wood"" used is so soft, that you CANNOT pick it up by the back.  I could easily break a piece off with my bare hand if I wanted to, no exaggeration.  I know because when I first got this amp I went to pick it up and I immediately stopped myself because I could feel it about to break.---BOTTOM LINE---BUY if...-This is the best amp you can afford-This matches the sound your after-You need the 100 Watts to be loud enough for a drumset-You want the Fender name and sound without the huge price-tag.DONT BUY if...-You play metal/hard rock-This is your first amp-You only plan on playing at bedroom levels-You can afford a tube amp"
542,121,4.0,"These tuners look and feel great. I used them on a Warmouth neck that I purchased for my strat build. It was kind of a pain having to drill the 2 holes for the prongs on each tuner, but that is the way it is designed. They would be a suitable replacement for Fender tuners should one ever break.The gold hardware looks awesome on my guitar."
419,121,3.0,Warning the tuners have two bumps instead of one. When I looked at the picture it looked like there was only one but there is two and I didnt find it anywhere in the description. Anyway it just lost one star for that I still put them on my guitar and it looks bad a@#!!!!
1110,121,2.0,"I put these on my Dlx Players Strat but it wasn't a piece of cake. First problem... no instructions came with the package. Found a method done by another searching online. Served as a guide. Second, after removing the old Fender Tuners I noticed the new tuners didn't fit into the slots. This meant drilling out the holes by another 1/8 of an inch. Blue tape both sides as to prevent marring. Third, the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock. There are also with two dimples. I used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement. Then carefully drilled two holes per tuner. Take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock. These rest was simple. Install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze.  If you are not mechanically inclined then I strongly suggest you go to a Luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job. For the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions."
197,121,3.0,"These are a direct drop in replacement on Fender Standard (MIM) stratocasters, Fender American Standard, Fender American Deluxe.I have replaced my tuners of this style with Fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back.Unfortunately, the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish. (But you can get them, ultimately.)I ordered a set of these non-locking ones - the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender's /schaller's gold hardware. (not all gold hardware is the same color gold). The quality is good and they look and function well. However, I returned them because they are not locking...I ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar I was building.If you just want gold tuners, don't care about the string locking feature, and are playing a fender strat or tele - you can't beat these. By comparison to a lot of the gold tuners, the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too."
92,850,4.0,"I will start with saying this is NOT a Class 1 Tube amp; meaning ALL tube in the pre-ampAND the amplifier sections. I will also say that if you can find one used - buy it. It is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp. Ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it.The Super Champ XD is considered a 'hybrid' amp. It uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid 15 watts of sound.  The power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube. I am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid. Thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web.This amp has two channels; one clean Classic 'Blackface' tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in 16 effects and 16 different amplifier voices.You can purchase a foot switch for about $25 that enable you switch between channelone and channel two.The amp also has a 1/4"" Speaker Out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker. There is also a 1/4"" Line Outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment. Unfortunately, there is not aHeadphone Output or Effects Loop.The amplifier use three tubes: 1x 12AX7 and 2x 6V6s. It's speaker is a 10 inch, 8ohm'Special Design' Fender. If you want to get louder, fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a Eminence 'Rajin Cajun'. You can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think. Some players are comfortable with the stock speaker.With regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods. This is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that.I will say that the clean channel is very nice whether I play through my Gibsons or myFender Tele. I very much enjoy the clean Blackface sound of the amp. It will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the Master.The Digital Voicing Processor(DSP), from what I read from more experienced players, arepretty darn close to the original. Voices like, Tweed, British (Think Vox jangle), FenderHot Rod, Metal, an Acoustic 'super clean' tone optimized for finger picking. There is alsoa clean Jazz tone that has the 'character of the Fender Jazz King amplifier'. Again, I amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices.With regard to the Effects (Vibratone, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, and Tremolo) the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic. It is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want 'authentic'.If you want or need  a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp. It  weighs only 25 pounds (10.9kg) so it's portability is very good. This ampwas a wonderful deal at $300 when I originally bought it in 2011. It is still a good dealtoday - if you can find one used."
260,850,4.0,"That's not to brag but to illustrate my experience with AMPS. Everything you can imagine. This AMP ranks up there with the best of them. I'm surprised as I've hated (with a passion) every DSP solid state amp I've ever played. This hybrid is incredible. The effects are excellent. The built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording. It has many onboard effects but I have racks and pedals that outdo those, so I don't use them for recording.It's not a band amp unless you're an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums. It's 15 Watts, but it's loud... it's just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums, though you might be fine for overdrive -- depending on the venue and situation.It's not going to emulate certain amps like a VOX very well, but it does excellent with a Fender Black face (excluding the tube reverb). It does a Bassman ok, but doesn't quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original '59 Bassman. Doesn't cost $11,000 dollars other. It does a Marshall pretty well. Marshall's based on '59 Bassman without the delicate touch, so there's no wonder. The acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full, yet doesn't sound like a filter. 0, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are amazing voices. You can bypass that and use  it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original Super Champ.I also have a 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound. When I'm just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don't wanna have to dial in sounds with my Vox AC30 or Fender Deluxe Reverb then this my amp of choice. It is miles ahead of a Fender Blues Deluxe.Yes, this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp I've played outside of a $2000 mesa boogie.Buy it. In fact, buy two. This is a future classic."
46,850,4.0,"If you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth, this is a fantastic amp for you.Fender has done an amazing job with this amp.IN this AMP, you have:All of the benefits of tubes, warmth at all dynamic levels, as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playing.The CHAMP Circuit.  Forget the fact that you have Digital amp models built in too, you also have a 15w Champ tube amp with a 10 inch speaker.  It's not exactly a '57 champ reissue, but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any Champ out there.  (People who like a great Champ tone, would pay more than $299 for a great 15w Champ amp.)Add to this, 16 Digital Presets.  Fender gives you Digital models through a Tube Circuit of Tweed Amps, Blackface Amps, Hot Rod Amps, as well as Metal Amps, A Jazz amp and an Acoustic sounding Model.Add to that some preset digital effects including Reverb, Delay, Vibe, Trem and Chorus.  (Each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect.)Everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the Digital Models are... and they are absolutely right.But this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a Tweed or Hot Rod tone directly to an authentic Champ amp.  Not a model of a Champ Amp, the real deal!The implications of this amp are really huge.  I'd love to see Fender do the same thing with a Pro Jr. or even a Blues Jr. Amp.  Perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp.  who knows.  But what I do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character.The Digital PresetsFor me, the highlights are the authenticity of the Tweed, Blackface and Hot Rod tones.  I really feel like channel 10 sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the 10 inch speaker.  The tweed tones are syruppy and awesome.  The Blackface clean sounds like a Princeton, and I even think they were trying to emulate a Deluxe Reverb on channel 5.As Far as Volume...People ask, is it loud enough to gig with?  Sure.  It can get loud enough over drums etc.  But, I'd mic it anyway.  I get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume.  Mic it and you can play it anywhere.The Only downsides...As much as Fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads, this amp really doesn't give Metalheads that much to work with.  It would be a great practice amp for any guitarist, Blues, Metal, Jazz or Country...But the Metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs.Lack of a Mid Control.  I'm not sure that I understand why you'd have an EQ with Treble and Bass with no Mid control.  Personally, it's the EQ knob that I would use the most, but if you are switching between Digital Presets you have to work with the Treble and Bass to find the sweet spot for your mids.  To my ears, it's not in the same spot on all presets.  That one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets.This amp is cool and unique. Which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when Fender releases the next big new thing.  Line 6 and Vox tube/digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out.  Fender has found a sweet spot of value, quality and usability.  This is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with 10 years later.Truly a unique and versatile creation."
52,850,4.0,"Well I love da Fender products, always have always will. I recently built me a nice custom strat, and had been testing out a few of the various mini-tube amps out on the market lately, (which is where I would categorize this amp) even though it has better tubes and more watts. These are my comparison testing amps, (I own both of the 2 amps below and have also tried a number of others in the music store down the road):Blackheart Killer Ant (12"" Blackheart cabinet)Vox AC4TV8 4-Watt 8"" Compact All-Tube Practice Amp with Celestion VX10 Speaker (also speakered out to the 12"" Blackheart cabinet)I've also tested all my amps in various ways by re-tubing them with a number of my collected tubes:Groove TubesJJ TubesSovtek TubesSvetlana TubesTung-Sol Tubes (gold)and straight out of the box, this thing beat them all of in sound quality, even with what a lot of people are calling a cheap Fender speaker version. I also plugged ""The Champ"" into my 12"" Blackheart speaker cabinet and it sounded even better using my strat (but I will do more speaker testing later). Fender amps have always leaned to sounding better with fender guitars, where as Gibson, Epiphone, type guitars really sound pretty good on the Vox and Blackheart models.Now when this amp came out, it was way overpriced but as always that price has fallin into a reasonable range. I mean the price of all of these mini-tube amps are minimal in comparison to the nicer ones, but again this thing is loaded with better guts, so maybe that why it screams better.... ya-hoo, me likey! Better guts, better performance, plus Fender has added an extra range of effects and amp sounds. Its small in size, light in weight, loud and easy to carry with you for jam sessions."
542,474,4.0,"I bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly. The holes lined up, it felt sturdy, and it is a genuine fender part.It isn't completely black though. There is a white stripe running around the outer edge. Not a problem for me, but it may be for some."
518,474,4.0,A genuine Fender part that looks great on my '10 MIM Strat. Good price and it arrived quickly as well.
669,474,4.0,"I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured I'd change the back plate as well. While nobody really sees the back, it drives me nuts when the front and back don't match. Because I didn't want to go without a back plate, as some people like to do, I picked this one up. The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install. You can't go wrong with genuine Fender parts."
1057,474,4.0,"Not much to say about this one.  It's a genuine fender trem cover, and it will do its job well."
1235,474,2.0,"The screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar, and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn't have to carry so many parts.  Nope, doesn't fit a Squire Affinity, just FYI."
145,474,4.0,"Fit my MIM strat perfectly, not much else to say.  Always buy Fender parts for Fender guitars, dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay, they wont fit."
1380,862,3.0,Does what its suppose to..only giving it 4 stars because they should have a multiple preset switch available rather then only letting you do one
695,862,4.0,"I needed a single button switch for my little Mustang I that I practice on. I've never owned the Fender model switch but I know what it is. It will do the job but it's lightweight and won't sit flat on the floor if the cord isn't laying exactly right. I searched a little further and ran across this switch on Amazon by scrolling down a bit. ""Marshall Footswitch, One Button With LED by AmplifiedParts."" Folks, this thing is built like a tank. The casing is made of heavy duty (I don't know what gauge) solid steel. There's nothing rinky dink about it. I plugged it in to the FTSW jack, clicked the button, the LED lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset. Again, light went out and back to the original. It felt solid under my foot and I don't think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb. sledge hammer. I don't know how well the electronics will hold up (I just got it today) but the switch, again, feels solid like it's supposed to. It cost me $20.90 with shipping. It takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we're use to with Amazon but it ships directly from AmplifiedParts, I believe. I'm a Fender fan but this beats their single switch. Thanks for reading guys. Lane H."
1224,862,4.0,"This is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your Fender Mustang amp. It is very easy to use, and works exactly as advertised. This switch is not bulletproof, but works great for playing around with your small practice amp."
1301,862,4.0,"Mr Miyagi couldn't have said it any better.Robust, compact unit which I use with a Fender Rumble 75. Plenty of lead so I can position it where I need it, and thank heavens for duct tape."
433,862,4.0,Nice foot switch for the mustang amp. Able to switch from clean to distortion quickly within a song easily. Great quality.
569,862,3.0,"Switches channels on my Mustang II like a charm. Would have received a 5-star rating had it been in a metal enclosure. It is plastic, but it suits my needs."
626,862,3.0,The fender 1 button footswitch is made specifically for the Fender Mustangs 1&2 It works exactly how i expected it to switches quickly and on point from effects though its only good for 2 effects (DUH!) the right angled plug is annoying after awhile because its RIGHT next too where you plug your guitar in and oftens get tangled with my guitar cord making it look messy. Other then that it gets the job done for when i practice & jam out with friends.
441,862,4.0,"Bought this switch as the OEM for my son's Bronco 40 which gives you an off/preset 1/preset 2 switching set up.  Simple, light and does what its suppose to.  Not built like a tank, but better than the cheap after market versions.  Gives you lots of cable so that it is good and practical for real life gig set ups.  Cable and plug are solid, thick Fender quality components. Worth the money."
1201,862,4.0,"At this time, I am using this switch on my Fender Frontman 25R to switch between the normaland drive channels. The 90 deg. jack is perfect for this (and a lot of amps),as there are no dials in this area. I have run into the 90 deg. jack problem, and the onlysolution I have found is to use a Mono to Stereo 1/4 inch gender changer, or a short monoextension cable (which is what I normally use, as the stereo jack presents added problems) as nobody makes a 1/4inch mono female to 1/4inch mono male gender changer, which I have found to be more than a little strange.This is a very old style switch that is made in China (like everything else) but works very wellfor this simple task. I have 4 on hand."
833,862,3.0,"Since I paid about $13 for this, I was not expecting a great deal. What I received was a decent enough floor switch for a Fender Mustang I or II. It works well as a way to switch between two user-determined presets on my Mustang II. Construction is about as good as I would normally get on a $13 item. It would be nice if the switch design allowed greater flexibility, but that's a function of the Mustsng II design overall. I'm not grading the switch on that.If you have a compatible Fender amp and can get this for less than $15, then it's a good deal. If prices go above that, best to wait it out or check the pricing of used units on the Amazon Marketplace."
174,862,4.0,"I just bought a tweed Blues Jr. and love the amp. It's got a great tone, much better than the black one I had 3-4 yrs. ago. I just downsized from a 40 watt Blues Deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side I can say they sound very, very similar, as they have the same speaker, but the BJ is much lighter.That being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo. I was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone, didn't do that on my last one. This pedal works great for that too, It feels very solid and it doesn't make any audible clicking noises that I can hear when engaging it."
656,725,1.0,"I bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar. It showed up on amazon when I was doing a search for ""Bass Guitar amps"", other regular guitar amps were not showing up so I was curious about it. After a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations, I thought I would give it a try because some people say yes, others said no. I wanted to test for myself. While I did get sound and was able to practice, it didn't have anywhere close to the tone I was hoping for. So I ended up returning it the next day. I'm not upset about the amp itself, just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search, which is the only reason I gave it a shot. For a regular guitar, this would be fine but not bass. I which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up. I was in the market for a practice amp for under $100 and was hopeful, but what I ended up doing was buying a used Acoustic B20 1X12 Bass Combo Amp for the same price as this new practice amp and I am a lot more satisfied. Again, this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar, not regular guitar."
523,725,0.0,"If you're a metalhead, STAY AWAY!! I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water. This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion. It's GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch. But if you demand metal, get far away!"
283,725,2.0,Should have paid the extra $40 and bought the Mustang - oh well. The amp has light sound and not much control. Good for my small space though.
219,725,3.0,"This is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of people.It produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you don't want to be too loud. It has a headphone jack also. I like this so much I might experiment with miking it for gigs, never thought I would say that about a 10 watt.Fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one. There is an overdrive on/off button with adjustable gain, volume control and a simple treble/bass equalizer. Other then that it is all rock. Physically it is built strong too."
645,725,3.0,"For the money, this thing sounds just fine. I got it for my son to toy around with. He barely ever uses it, but the times it's been plugged in, it puts out pretty good sound for the price."
860,725,4.0,"I recently bought this for my first electric guitar and I thoroughly enjoy it. It has a lot of power and noise behind it. It is a little starter amp, just in case the picture was a little deceiving. I cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion. With distortion, it sounds great. It is a solid piece of work, and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp."
474,725,4.0,Exactly what I needed for testing guitars and playing at home.  Same as what comes with epiphone bundles but with fender on it
289,725,4.0,This Fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along. It sounds great and I like the headphone and MP3 player hookups. Good value.
171,163,3.0,"Every midi usb converter on amazon below 50 bucks seemed sketchy, but I tried this one with my Casio keyboard. Works on Logic and Garageband, however whenever I try to use modulation or pitch bend, it creates a actual note on my Mac and won't stop unless you quit the program. Be wary."
1298,163,1.0,Great price but unfortunately this product didn't work for me. Fortunately I had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall I'm happy with the results.
1402,163,1.0,"This works in some applications, but doesn't work in many others. Even when detected by the software, it will not work with Line 6 equipment. Too bad, because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop."
1195,163,2.0,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago. I used it to connect my Behringer BCR2000 (in MIDI mode, naturally!) to my computer for mixing duties in REAPER. It worked with no issues and I had zero complaints.A few weeks ago it stopped working (I had bent the USB connector and so I thought that was the culprit) so I bought another.The replacement arrived and installed with no issues, but I'm still having trouble getting it to send MIDI data into the computer. MIDI out of the computer to the Behringer is fine. I'm not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky Windows update that's happened lately, but it's certainly not ideal! :(In my haste, having seen it install OK but without trying to actually use it, I discarded the packaging. Unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit, so now it looks like I'm stuck with two possibly-broken USB / MIDI interfaces. I have reinstalled Windows, tried both with another computer, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, all kinds of good stuff and I still can't get either of them to send MIDI data into the computer. I was v-e-r-y close to throwing my Behringer unit away as I thought it was broken too!Thankfully I tried an old Yamaha interface and it is OK. This means I just need to get and buy some MIDI cables and I'll be back in business.So, I'd say buy one of these, and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away! When they work they're absolutely great and they're SO cheap! If you receive a lemon, return it and order another. It's worth it if you're not in a hurry. If you *are* in  a hurry then order a few of them, or just get something else.I'd also like to advise people that reports of MIDI latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer. I strongly suspect that the speed of transferring MIDI data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think, and the actual latency you're experiencing is that of converting your MIDI data into audio. This happens inside your computer and has **nothing** to do with this device's performance; it's purely down to your hardware and software configurations. All this talk of ASIO is only really going to help you on the audio side of things. If you're using this device to record MIDI data then you should have no issues at all... as long as you get one that works! :-)Cheers."
522,163,2.0,"I was able to connect it to my PC. There was a horrible delay between the keyboard and the PC, but once I installed better midi software (CoolSoft VirtualMIDISynth) and turned down the delay, it's nearly realtime. I had problems getting it to work on my iMac. It recognized the device's presence, but it didn't produce any sound on the computer."
910,163,4.0,I am very pleased with the product.  It has performed better than I had expected.  I recommend it highly.  I shall probably order more from this company in the future.
1075,163,0.0,Doesn't wotk with V-Amp 3.  Doubt it works at all.  Red light always stays on and I've never seen the green light.
1353,163,1.0,"I don't know how this will work with other MIDI instruments but I tried it with the Roland TD9 drums and although it does transmit the data, the drum map is totally off. The respective triggers (hihat, hihat pedal, etc) are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the PC end of it, it was just a freaking hassle. I needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my Notebook (which doesn't have a MIDI input) but I gave up in the end and went with my desktop PC and its MIDI interface."
1352,163,4.0,It works perfect with Cakewalk Music creator 5 and a Digitech vocalist. Best price out there.
455,163,4.0,I've been using this for a year to home record through midi and its a great buy. This was so much less expensive than a lot of other ones but it works just fine. No regrets on the buy at all.
998,163,1.0,"My advice- spend more and get something that will work with all applications.  Cheap midi may get you there, but if not you have to buy another.  Yep, always the gamble."
674,163,4.0,"Cheap, works great for playing and foot controllers. Will not handle bulk dumps, so I have to use a different interface for programming and backups."
1082,163,4.0,My puppy destroyed my name brand midi cable.  I bought this to fill the gap until I could by another name brand but since it works so reliably I'll saving my money for other things.  If the puppy murders this one I'll order up another one just like this.
835,617,4.0,"I needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs.  I went to the large Guitar store and tried out several in this price range and couple hundred above and settled on this one because of the sweet sound and workmanship.  For the money I don't think it can be beat.  Mahogany not plywood sides and back and Cedar top make for a really nice mellow tone and a bone nut and saddle thrown in for good measure.  Bone does make a considerable difference I have found.  All the finish is excellent.  Now for some down sides.  Yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends.  As for leveling it seemed OK.  So I took some time and masked off the fret board and finished the frets flush with the fingerboard and rounded the sides and tops.  Cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it.  You can make your own clear plastic pick guards to any size by going to Wal Mart and in the material sewing department you will find clear plastic in large rolls.  You can buy a half yard long x 54"" and make enough pick guards to last a life time for a couple bucks.  It clings to the gloss finish nicely. (Do not use this on old guitars with Nitro finish it will eat the finish instantly)  Same goes when changing strings.  Put some masking tape at the end of the bridge on the top to prevent the strings from scratching the Cedar top.  Overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down.  I put a Baggs I-Beam pickup in it also.  Easy installation and nice natural sound.  It is nice as it does not have a big EQ cut into the side of the body."
565,617,4.0,I've been playing guitar for 40 years. This was my 1st decent classical guitar. I own a Gibson Hummingbird and an Alvarez acoustic as well as electrics by most major manufacturers. I like the fact that it has a truss rod which I've already adjusted to improve the action. The tone is very rich for such an inexpensive guitar. The finish is pretty and I like the solid cedar top. It records very well and sounds as good as more expensive models. The case is nice as well. So far I've had no problems. I bought new strings but haven't replaced them yet. The old strings are very worn but the guitar still sounds loud and &#34;alive&#34;. I'm sure new strings will also improve the already wonderful sound.
491,617,4.0,Just starting out (again) playing guitar and ordered up this Classical. From the moment I took it out of the box I was impressed. The finish was really nice and the sound is awesome. Seems to stay in tune pretty well too. For under $300 you can't go wrong :-)
809,617,4.0,"This is the first guitar I've bought without playing it first, so I was apprehensive. But it's a fine guitar. It's plain to look at - no decoration or embellishments, but the sound is rich and full, as if it were at least ten years old. I like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing. The tuners are geared low, which allows precise tuning. It came with Savarez strings - not the best I've used, but good. And I was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag. It's strong and durable, and well designed. All in all, I doubt I could have found a better quality product for such a low price."
334,617,4.0,"We went to the local GC to try out different guitars, mostly blind to the price, just looking to see what we liked best.  After a couple of hours, we found ourselves repeatedly coming back to the Cordoba C5.  It has a nice resonant sound, good playability, and very attractive finish.  The room we were in at GC had classical guitars up to $1200 and we really didn't find a guitar we liked better.  We had a $50 coupon, so we bought it from GC, but afterwards took it to our local music shop to have their tech look it over for us.  He was also very impressed, especially with the fact that unlike most classicals, this one has a truss rod adjustment.  It required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup."
303,617,4.0,"I snagged this beauty during a holiday sale here on Amazon and this baby is wonderful for the price. I previously had theLucero LC100 Classical Guitar Black (Black)which I was completely happy with as a beginner. When it got damaged beyond repair, I looked into theCordoba Dolce 7/8 Size Classical Guitarwhich was absolutely wonderful but I decided I didn't really like the size, so after liking the Cordoba brand I decided on the C5.It is absolutely a wonderful guitar at this price range. The Lucero was great for my level and it was decent enough to look at but the C5 has a vibrancy and deep tone to it that I was surprised to hear from a budget guitar. While it isn't it the prettiest guitar out there, it's by no means ugly. Even though mass produced a lot of quality is still apparent in this guitar.The smell of this guitar is also amazing. It doesn't have the cheap wood glue smell of other low-end guitars, but a nice rich smell of wood. Even after a few months, kept in a humicase, the sound is great and that fresh wood smell is still present.All praise aside, it is not a flawless guitar. My main complaint would be that the action is really high but this is something that is pretty common with new guitars, especially those at a lower price range. Not necessarily a flaw but something to be aware of: being a cedar guitar, the wood is very soft so I recommend wear soft clothing without buttons or zippers on it while playing because these will leave small dents on the back of the guitar.I do enjoy the padded gig bag and thought that it was a nice touch to the package. It is a high-quality gig bag with lots of padding. Inside the bag is a velcro neck rest with a strap to keep the guitar in place. It also has a large front packet that is large enough for a few music books. When I ordered this guitar from Amazon, the guitar shipped inside the gig bag and inside of a big box. I had no issues with shipping and the guitar arrived safely.Overall, I do not regret this purchase and once I take it in for a setup to get the action lowered, it will be a superb guitar that I will enjoy for years. Highly recommended!"
511,735,2.0,"The picks we received were ""Legacy"" and not ""Alice"" brand. While not as pictured, these are good enough for us as we (my daughert, son, and me) learn to play guitars. The mix of different thicknesses was fairly even, so we were able to select the one that felt ""right"" for each of us.The pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks.CFH"
1182,735,4.0,"Wow, is what my teenage son said when he opened this on Christmas morning.  He loved the variety & number of picks!"
1351,735,4.0,I've been using these picks for eight months and they last forever. I lose them before they wear out. I'll be buying and recommending these for a long time.
505,735,2.0,"These picks come in a large range of sizes, but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with.There is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers, but it goes away after a bit.They seem to be decent quality. The thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly.These are ok to have around the house to play with but I would not recommend them for live performance."
836,735,3.0,This was a great purchase.  A bagful of pretty picks to help my son with his new guitar.  Good thing there were so many in the bag because he seems to keep losing them.  Great price and purchase.
717,623,4.0,"Made of leather or high-quality pleather, so it seems built-to-last. I use it on my Seagull and it totally works great. I would definitely recommend, but it's kind of expensive for what it is."
231,623,1.0,"I may have misunderstood the product description but I prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this. My issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when I play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer. If you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the product itself; it just wasn't what I thought."
999,623,3.0,"Nothing special here. If you don't like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap, and you don't want to bore a hole in the heel, then this is a nice compromise. There are slits on both ends of the leather, which means you can reverse the button if you don't want the logo on the front of the guitar neck/headstock. You could even flip it inside-out and have the soft leather side exposed. I subtracted a star because I think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic."
524,623,1.0,"Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just didn't fit well for me. Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. A string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed."
1376,623,4.0,"I bought this for my Sigma DMC-15E, it allows my guitar to hang better than the lasso type headstock straps and looks much better, they leather is very high quality and is very supple."
1105,623,4.0,"For those Martins and Sigmas, as well as, other guitars without a neck brace button, this is the secure way to connect your strap. Forget the leather shoe-string clipping that comes with some straps, this is secure and won't ever end up with loose ends on the first fret. Nothing to tie or untie, a quick button connection is all that's needed. Just make sure your choice of strap is long enough since the distance to the neck is greater than the guitar body. Doesn't improve functionality but, the matching logo is a nice touch for Martin and Sigma guitars."
77,623,4.0,"Am totally pleased that I did not have to drill my guitar to use a strap on it ! Works great,get one!!!"
771,623,4.0,"Why didn't I think of this? Is what it is and does what it says its does. From Martin, nuff said!"
606,623,3.0,"This was a bit hard to install; over or under the strings? We tried both. Over the strings, it would slide below the nut, which isn't good. Under the strings, and it muffled a few. So we kind of WOVE it, above some and under others. Other than that, it works fine, holds the strap with no problems. And it puts the name &#34;Martin&#34; on the lowliest box guitar ;). In hindsight, I'd have probably just got a strap button and mounted it to the base of the neck. But if you don't want to do that, and hate the &#34;lace&#34; approach, this will do the trick. It may even fit better on different guitars, ours is a 50 year-old Norma (that actually sound AMAZING considering its origins; guess old wood just SOUNDS better). And the price is VERY right to be able to claim you own &#34;A&#34; Martin, lol."
721,623,4.0,This is a vey simple fix to a constant problem with guitar straps and where to connect the strap to your guitar.  It goes on in a jiffy and the over the neck strap connects easily.  It is a great idea and worth the cost.  I hate having to drill a hole in my guitars.
490,623,4.0,This is what I have been looking for for my accoustic guitar.  Makes my life easier when I pack up and set up the equipment.
1201,623,4.0,"I like to attach ALL of my guitars by the neck/headstock instead of using thetop button, and have just used the typical shoestring in the past, but no more.Once you get this baby on the strap, it is not going anywhere.I have a few of these installed on guitars (and one bass) I play a lot.They (obviously) give a lot more support than a string, and will not dig in tothe finish as a string might.Give it a try, you just may like the way the guitar sits, as you don't get the neckdrop that comes with just attaching to the body of the guitar."
908,623,4.0,Just what I needed...easy to attach and saved drilling a hole for my guitar strap. Works like a charm!I recommend this product.
1227,59,4.0,This audio adapter works perfectly.  Why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio.  I'm able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers.
619,59,2.0,"I used this to create a custom sound card on my macbook pro when using Traktor Scratch Pro.  Did not end up doing what I needed with it, which was to be able to preview (there is a new toy on the market for that now) but it was good for adding additional channels to my limited macbook pro sound card.Good in a pinch!"
1422,59,4.0,"I primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones, so that I can connect/convert the 3.5mm headphone jack into my pc.The audio adapter is well built. It has a yellow LED light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a 3.5mm jack.Installation was flawless. Windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately.No issues. No nonsense. Simply works!"
887,59,3.0,"its working great, but it does not work in stereo. It is a mono adapter, the stereo adapters are a little more expensive."
864,59,3.0,"Great quality. I bought this at the same time as another 7.1 HD USB sound card, but that one break. This one has lasted. My only complaint is that even with the sound all the way down to 1, it is still fairly loud and I end up turning down the volume in whatever app I'm using."
564,59,4.0,"This product has a mono-microphone input and a stereo headphone output.  It is meant for connecting a headset to a USB port.  Since the headset has a mono-microphone, this adapter works great.  The drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems.  This product is great for using a soft-phone or other communications program.  The windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected.  I imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this, but it was mainly built for a headset.  Works seemless and great with a headset."
1166,59,2.0,For Macs but fyi it goes out after 45mn and just need to be unplugged and back in. Not a big deal.
660,59,4.0,"I got this to use on an old Mac computer to allow me to use some equipment that needed more than a line level output. It works great for that. Haven't used it for anything else, though, so cant comment there. Seems sturdy and well made as well."
678,59,4.0,"The audio jack on my laptop was failing.  I had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until I could hear both channels.  By that time half the youtube video was over.  What a hassle!  I'm trying to imagine how can I crack the case, get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when I ran across this great idea.  A plug-and-play USB device with both input and output audio jacks.  Took about one minute to install on my Dell Inspiron, which recognized it immediately.  Problem solved quickly and elegantly.Shipping was free and prompt from the Amazon partner.  Good job, Platinum Micro, Inc.I understand the input jack is mono so don't try to use this as a quasi recording studio.  And consider the availability and accessibility of your USB ports.  Then, order this great little solution to a big problem."
1321,591,4.0,"This pedal is awesome. I use it the most of all my pedals, because it's pretty much perfect. I can get 4 completely different sounds out of it. It's also true-bypass, so it will not effect your tone when it is off. It's much smaller than the big muff pi, which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard. Just to let you all know, this is NOT an overdrive or distortion pedal. It is a fuzz pedal. So don't buy it expecting overdrive. Also, when it's turned on you will hear a hum, but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights, and muff pedals hum alot. None of that makes me dislike the pedal. It's one of the hest fuzz pedals ever. I use it in front of a wah, and that's all I'll ever need to use pedal-wise. Get this pedal!!!!!!!"
1220,591,4.0,"As a disclaimer, I am not a Big Muff connoisseur.  I've never owned one before this.  I also tend not to like fuzz as an effect.  I'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz, maintaining enough definition for chord work.  If you're reading the reviews, you've probably already done your research on the features, but I'll cover them anyway.Three simple controls, Volume - Tone - Sustain, with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control.  The enclosure is a smaller, pedalboard-friendly size.  The pedal incorporates two of the (supposedly) most popular Big Muff mods with switches, Tone and Wicker.  When Tone is switched off, the Tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected.  In this mode, the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly, and it also produces a significant volume boost.  The Tone knob does nothing.When Wicker is switched on, it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound.  Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher, with a high-end frequency boost.I use this pedal running into a mild overdrive, the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret, which ""conditions"" the signal.  I play with the Tone off and Wicker on, and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low, this combination results in a wonderfully thick, massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth.If you're looking to get a Big Muff, and you're not a snob about which version, the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound.  Not to mention that, at this price point, it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs.  Highly recommended."
192,591,3.0,"My Big muff PI with Wicker had hellacious noise, I mean unusable. I noticed it would change with movement so I pulled the back off and immediately found paint overspray where the grounding spring from the circuit board meets the inside of the housing. After aggressively scraping the paint off, the pedal operates as I would expect it to.I really like the tone and aggressive drive of the big muff and the Tone and wicker switches are nice although I find that with the Wicker opened up/ON the noise level gets marginally too high; so long as you're playing hard and loud it's not really an issue. This pedal isn't designed to be quiet when you're not playing so don't be fooled there, it is normal for it to make some noise when there's not guitar input/strumming. The bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised.I'll be keeping the pedal and like it but the lack of QA from my proudly made in America fuzz pedal was a bit of a let down; fortunately I found the problem and fixed it myself to avoid a return."
1193,894,2.0,"the mat is only a few $ neoprene (kind of) mat, the neck holder thing is inserted in the tube that contain the mat... TAKE IT OUT very very carefully, I was only careful and the base of the neck holder broke a bit...In my opinion this thing if priced $15 or $20 less will be what it really worth on the market.P.S.The Wise Man Say:Do yourself a favor, use a long pillow over your desk to tune up/intonate your Strat or Tele and use this $$ to buy good strings! :D"
73,894,4.0,"It works! This guitar support couldn't be simpler. The neck rest is a molded plastic cup with that soft spongy material inside the neck support. The mat is a thick light weight foam mat (a bit like a yoga mat) with a hole cut in it. The neck support cup goes through that hole. That's it for set up. The mat protects the guitar body. The support cup holds the guitar at exactly the right angle to work on it, change strings, adjust the truss rod, work on the pickups, or clean the guitar. The guitar can be placed in strings up or down.This wouldn't be a difficult DIY project, but I'd be missing out on that cool Fender logo if I made this out of wood and a yoga mat. Honestly, this looks really sharp put together.The whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube. That tube is an excellent storage tube."
574,894,3.0,"This simple tool helps protect my guitar from scratches when I'm changing strings, or just cleaning it up.  It's a foam cushion with a neck supporter.  It rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage.  Well worth it."
664,894,4.0,"The description says it all but I was still wondering if I made the right choice because I was comparing the ""Fender Accessories 099-0502-000 Guitar Tools"" -what the heck kind of name is that anyway?!- with NO reviews to theJim Dunlop NC65  Formula 65 Neck Cradle Maintenance Stationthat had some pretty good reviews.Well, I cannot speak for the Dunlop but I can say that this kit is light weight, self-contained, has storage space in it, and it works if the guitar is face-up or face down.It also has pad to keep your guitar from sliding - and the pad keeps the neck rest in place so it does not topple over!  I do not see anything like that mentioned in the Dunlop NC65.On top of it, I think the neck rest & pad inGuitar Setup & Maintenance - Instructional Guitar DVD With Denny Rauenis this one turned over so the ""Fender"" logo is not showing..."
1407,894,4.0,This product makes changing strings on a guitar easy; a must for anyone with any type guitar. It is basically the same thing sold or made all the major brands of guitars. It holds the guitar secure while changing strings or making adjustments. It also is easy to store when finished.
1173,894,4.0,"Yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows. But this tool is very well designed. It keeps the guitar from sliding and positions it at a nice angle for maintenance. In storage mode, the mat rolls up into the clear plastic tube and takes up very little space. The bottom cover doubles as a storage compartment for your hex wrenches, string winder, and feeler guages.But the real reason I give this product five stars is because it allows me to work on my guitars while keeping them in perfect condition. That increases their resale value, so the tool pays for itself. And it gives me a lot of pleasure to have the right tools for the job. With the right tools, I enjoy working on my guitars almost as much as playing them. While I hear what those complaining of the high cost are saying, I am used to paying higher prices for good tools and I think this qualifies as a good tool. I used it to put new pickups in and setup my Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging my guitar. Without this tool, I don't think I would have been so lucky."
698,894,4.0,If you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment. It protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up. Supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar.
474,894,2.0,Long wait for overpriced item.  Arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait. Overpriced but was expected as Fender name on product..
332,70,4.0,"Not much to day, it's a polishing cloth, it cleans your guitar, and it does it right. Good price too, nothing to complain about."
62,70,2.0,"Yup, it's O.K.  Nothing special.  I don't know if it's the best one out there but it does the job."
805,70,4.0,"Purchased this for my son to use on his guitars.  He absolutely loves it. Has been wanting a cloth like this for his guitars.  Prompt shipping, great price, great product."
92,70,3.0,"This Fender Treated Polish Cloth; a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is asimple product. The classic Fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth. The resealableplastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read, 'FENPC1' and states it's size as being, 12 inchesby 15 inches.Well, its size, as I measured it, is actually 12 inches by 14-5/8 inches. Just wanted to mention itbecause I have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this. Me, no problem. The missing3/8 of an inch is a minor detail. Go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s. Now, you won'tactually find any actual '2x4's. They've been shrinking for over 50 years.I am not sure what this cloth is *treated* with but it does not feel any different than the UN-treatedGibson polishing cloths I have purchased. I also gave it the nose test. I thought there  might be a hintof, or a whiff of, some polish or something. Nope. No scent. No whiff.What I did find disconcerting is the warning in 'Product Details' section on the Amazon web page. It isthe fourth bullet down: ""California residents: Click here for Proposition 65 warning.""  Below is thewarning verbatim from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon for posting this warning.* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ** ""California's Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that* contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other* reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain* threshold levels. We care about our customers' safety and hope that the information below* helps with your buying decisions.* We are providing the following warning for products linked to this page:* WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer* and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *Just thought I let you know about that one. I guess the missing 3/8s of an inch  is really no big deal atthis point. You just need to worry that, in your concerns for keeping your beautiful guitar sparkling clean,you could get cancer. WoW.  Back to the review...The Fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the Gibson cloths but not much differencebetween the two. Well, the Gibson cloth does have a whip-stitch edging around it. Other than THAT, notmuch difference.When I use the Fender cloth on my Fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left. I  like tokeep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that. Idon't use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as theneck.So, based on the fact that Fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar I will give thisamazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth 4 stars. It appears to do  what it supposed to do,and that is polish your guitar without harming it.It gets one less star because of the California Prop 65 warning. I suppose I need to take this a somewhatseriously so I docked it one star. I will definitely be washing my hand right after using it.So far no harm has been done to any guitars in the writing of this review. For the future I am not so sureabout me. Thank you, and say, 'Goodnight', Gracie......Note About Vendor: GO-DPS responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time. It was 4 dayspast the delivery date. I e-mailed them. They responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail tome that came in an appropriate amount of time. For such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service. I will use them again in the future."
1050,70,4.0,"Nothing exciting about these things, but they do the job well. I polished my 1991 Gibson Les Paul with this recently and I'd forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was. Does a great job."
1071,70,4.0,Great polishing cloth. Not much to say here other than it works and works well. Removes all the fingerprints and polishes my baby up like new after each practice or gig. Can't go wrong.
1041,592,4.0,"My kids were excited to split this pack of picks. Since there were two of each in the pack, they didn't have to argue over who got which pick. These are very unique and a nice way to personalize your playing. I think these would make a great gift for a grandparent or parent who played guitar in the 60's and 70's."
26,592,4.0,"I like those guitar picks and their colors, they are well designed and useful, it comes with different shapes and colors, that makes them easy to locate if you lose them on the floor or anywhere"
883,592,4.0,The guitar picks were exactly what I was looking for. I like hard picks and these were the ones I needed.
502,592,4.0,"These picks have proven their worth when I thrash them on my strings in an epic guitar solo or extreme metal I find myself playing all too often. Great picks, would buy 'em again.Bottom line:These guitar picks are outstanding."
796,874,0.0,They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex
218,874,4.0,"Always looking for reasonable pricing.  The picks were as good as advertised online, it met our expectations and pricing was good."
191,874,4.0,"These are very nice looking guitar picks. I've used these and don't have any problem with them.Thanks, Austin Garcia"
348,874,4.0,This package of picks is of good colors and good weight. They seem to be easier to hold and pick without being to stiff.
170,874,3.0,these are well made...good enough to give to buddies and have a few in every guitar case i own..will purchase again..enjoy
370,874,4.0,I'm not one to use picks much so when I do I prefer a light pick. I will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because 25 will last a very long time. It is fun to share :-) For those needing a light pick go for these. Recommended.
388,874,4.0,"These work fine; no cracking, they come in a nice assortment of colors, and they're easy to see when they get dropped."
500,874,4.0,"What else can be said about them, they're good picks. They strum well, they pick well and they look good"
850,874,4.0,These are good picks and produce a great tone.  They're better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers.
96,874,3.0,i bought 10 pack of this and i'm still using one so far and is still good. nice quality and good price too.
262,874,3.0,this picks are great for hard rock since they are heavey but not that heavy for solos. I play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great.
965,874,4.0,"I purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present. So far, so good. You can't beat the price. Thanks."
337,874,4.0,The picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well.  I have not had them very long but seem to do well.
1334,874,4.0,100 picks for 20 dolares? Hell yeah! I'm really happy with my new picks! It's really cheap and the quality is good!
326,874,4.0,"Not an expert at string picking by any means, but they do what I need them to do just fine."
251,874,4.0,"I reshape my own pics on my grinder, and use nothing but heavy picks,  There are just guitar picks.  They are what you order.  I fix mine up by adding stair tread floor stuff, so they don't slip out of my hand."
208,874,4.0,"great product for the price, I mean they are guitar picks and medium picks at that.  Nice gloss finish and the designs on them is pretty cool"
825,874,4.0,These guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing.  The colors are nice as well.  I would recommend these.
344,874,4.0,They do what they are meant to do. No complaint for the price and they have a pretty dang cool lookin design to them.
1042,874,4.0,"Love the colors and the price can't be beat. Wished maybe they came in yellow? Other than that, great picks."
899,874,2.0,It is all preference. I prefer the cactus picks. These slide around in my finger to much right now. To each his own.
329,874,4.0,These are high quality picks. Medium is my personal choice & they did not disappoint me. Will buy this brand again.
1332,874,4.0,"I have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these Planet Wave Picks are much nicer than the others. They are clean cut, smooth finish. Nice texture and looking. I reach for these first.Would and will buy again and recommend!"
36,874,4.0,"They are good quality guitar picks, and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for some guitar picks."
128,874,4.0,"Hey it's a pick, it's 10 to a bag....I lost one already so now I have 9.  I my world that's good stuff."
182,874,4.0,These picks were a good deal. They are pretty cool looking and I will be able to use them for a long time. They are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks.
687,874,4.0,"They're my favorite picks and I always buy the medium ones! I'm sure other picks works just fine, but these are always my preference."
1152,874,3.0,Very nice guitar picks for the very fair price.  I like them very much.  Of course I am just a beginner.
660,874,4.0,"I've probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life, and find that Planet Waves makes a good one at a fair price. Picks will always be a subjective thing, every user has his/her own preference, so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end. These are well made, last quite awhile, and they don't even look bad, try them out, you might just like them :-)"
1103,874,4.0,"These picks were a filler item for a much larger order.  I can always use guitar picks, however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel."
951,874,3.0,Our teenager really likes these.  As a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers.  Have not broken one yet.
428,874,3.0,"These are high quality thick guitar picks. The colors are great. Unfortunately I would have expected a little better packaging. I know the company is trying to save money, but having them in a tiny plastic bag and tapped to a piece of paper in the envelope was a little less exciting to receive. Almost didn't know what it was because of this. Just seemed like a bunch of advertisements and mail."
44,874,4.0,I'm new to the guitar and I'm just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best (for me) with different guitars and different effects. I like these for my acoustic Ibanez dreadnaught. The pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the D'addario strings. They are comfortable and I like the feel in my hand. The mediums suit me. Maybe it is all personal taste but I think they are worth buying. Amazon pricing is great. The picks feel great and I'm having a good time.
592,874,4.0,"Not bad for the price they have it for. Multi color and easy to use. Durable pick, would recomened for you to buy it"
188,874,4.0,"very nice guitar pics, sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics, very lovely, size was as expected, great sound"
1061,874,4.0,I bought these guitar picks for my son. He really likes them a lot. I would definitely buy them again.
615,874,3.0,"I've been playing for over 30 years and these are perfectly fine guitar picks.  Not special but not disappointing either.  As long as your hands don't sweat a lot you'll be fine with these.But a real ""assorted"" pack of picks should be more than just assorted colors.  A real useful assortment would be a pack with different thicknesses.  I like to experiment with different types of picks.  These ""assorted"" picks are really all the same, just different colors."
883,874,4.0,My mother has a habit of stealing my picks so I always order from them. They always give me good picks to use.
588,874,4.0,"I bought these for my music class. The teens really liked the colors to choose from, and I like the price!"
1039,874,4.0,Great picks!  Nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style.I would recommend these for any guitar player!
1394,874,4.0,I bought these to fill the Dunlop 5005 Pick Holder that I also purchasd.  Nice selection...and the price was right.
1424,874,2.0,"These feel very good but they wear off quite quickly, so not pick taping and easy with the struming. Also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical."
1011,874,4.0,received them in four days....just in time for my first lesson....Can't say much more than that because I am just beginning lessons and don't really know what to look for yet....
1114,874,4.0,I like the quality of the picks. Not too hard or soft and quite fit to my play style. Thanks!
628,516,3.0,"Guitar picks. What can I say? I bought these along with my first guitar, so its not like I have a preference. But they come in a pack of 10 so there are plenty of spares when you lose them, and you will. Definitely good enough to start with until you gain enough experience to know the difference between all the many kinds of picks."
899,516,2.0,It is all preference. I bought a couple cactus picks and I like the fact they stick to my fingers better. These are slick and seem harder to keep track of.
176,78,3.0,These picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction. It's easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks. give them a shot
1305,78,3.0,"great picks,, they are shorter for speed and maneuvering sweeps better not to stumble in strings when sweep,, so for me it works fine i do use Th turtle purple big ext HH as well but i like to try this for experiment to see how it helps spleen on sweeps etc,, nice picks well made"
1166,78,2.0,"Good picks but not a replacement for jazz 3 that I still prefer over this one, nice backup in case you run out."
1059,78,4.0,"I'm really happy with the Black Ice Heavy picks (1.10 mm), which I bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of Dunlop Jazz IIIs.I would call the Black Ice picks medium sized.  They are roughly the same size and shape as Fender 551 picks, but a little bigger than the Jazz IIIs.  They are stiffer than the 551s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the IIIs (and thinner than the IIIs too).One thing that may account for the nice way the Black Ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the 551s (which I still like) and from the Jazz IIIs.In terms of playability, they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness.But the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you:  The tone.  I love the tone I get with these picks, and the best I can do for you is to say that I was looking for a pick that would generate a solid, mellow jazz tone with an archtop - a tone that reminds me of say, Barney Kessel (but without Barney's chops of coursse).  This is what the Black Ice delivers."
921,78,4.0,"I do like this pick, I bought a few different types to have a variety to &#34;Pick&#34; from.  A suggestion from my teacher.  Good suggestion, depending on what kind of guitar I'm playing on, it changes the tone.  I like this one."
372,172,4.0,"Unless you have a taste for really thin picks, this material and thickness will suffice for all uses, both single-line leads and strumming. This pick finally got me away from my old favorite Fender tortoise mediums, though I do still keep them around."
403,172,4.0,"I bought this on a whim. I was pretty satisfied with the extra heavy picks I was using, but wanted something with more grip. These picks have a logo and the company name molded in, which gives purchase to you pickin fingers to hold on to the pick. This seems to be a perfect thickness for some of my guitars that have silk and steel strings. With the xtra heavy picks I was losing what little treble these strings had. With this little purple wonder I got my treble back and still had great control for playing fast or playing hard.I like them so much I bought another hundred just in case the purple pick monster eats all my other picks.Its a great pick, its delrin or whatever(delflex) generic name they give it to avoid trademark issues, but its the best plastic for picks in my book. The tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful. I keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases.I recommend these if you enjoy playing guitar or just enjoy owning things that are purple colored. They don't taste like grapes however."
16,172,3.0,"If you are prone to losing your guitar picks, this is a good set of 10 picks to have around all in your choice of a single color per pack. The quality is a bit better than the cheap fishbowl picks at the music store, but not as good as my favorite picks,Dunlop Big Stubby Picks, 2.0mm."
322,172,3.0,"They are comfortable to use.  The Planet Wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick; and I like heavy picks, so the ""heavy"" option fits my preference.  I've got a gig tomorrow night, so we'll see how they work then."
717,822,4.0,"I liked these a lot. For the price they work very well, and I am very happy that I bought them. I got a couple of those straight-coupler things, but really their use is quite limited because input jack heights on different effects pedals are rarely the same height so you can't use the straight-couplers. You don't run into that problem with these - they can connect any pedal to any other pedal."
475,822,4.0,How much can you say about a patch cable. This is a good one at a good price.I recommend it.
692,822,3.0,"They work well, but they are not Mogami.That being said, I use them in my rig, and bought some for my brothers. We both seem pretty happy with it."
98,822,4.0,These are very sturdy cables and really work well on my pedalboard. I expect them to last for a long time
388,822,4.0,"I'm using these cables to string effects pedals together; I've had no issues with them so far.  They seem sturdy enough for rough handling, and I'm not noticing any extra noise."
13,822,2.0,"I found that these were OK but the heads were bigger than I could stand to use on my cramped for space pedal board.  So, they sit in a drawer as spare parts for other cables."
583,822,3.0,"use them for home recording,  nothing on the road. for that purpose these are made well. wouldnt use these regularly for gigging wear and tear would break them down pretty quickly."
15,822,4.0,"I ordered two sets so that I could set everything up in nice orderly progression on my stomp box.  Heard no evidence of hum and they seem to work just fine keeping everything in order!By the way, these are listed as  .5 feet (6""), but actually are 10"".  Wish I had measured as I ordered a 12"" long cords thinking they would be twice as long.  Oooops, my bad when I discovered they were only 2"" longer!"
524,822,4.0,They do the job and are made well. I guess the high dollar cables are better but it's hard to tell the difference.
1388,822,4.0,"These little patch cables have been indispensable since I used them to set up my pedalboard. They're durable and tough, yet provide a high level of flexibility when it comes to using them in tight spaces inbetween effects pedals. I previously had been using some Fender Tweed patch cables, and they just weren't flexible enough, even though they looked cool for days. So if you're looking for a great patch cable for your pedalboard, look no further my friend."
680,822,4.0,"If you're not using a pedal board these are just what you need. Good price....Good quality. I use them for the times that a short patch cord is better then tripping over longer cables.  I use them to patch-in additional effects outside of my pedal board and they're perfect for patching my amp head to a slave head.  BUT!!!.... If you're building a pedal board  AMAZON sells, solid, double- male,  connecters (Digitech PC-2 Hardwire Accessory Premium Gold Plated 1/4"" Male Coupler) that work great and really clean-up your pedal board."
1037,822,3.0,"The cable is great material, the 90's with boots are just right and have a lot of strength for durability.  Price is right for sure."
1124,822,4.0,"I use these with my MXR Effects Pedals and they are awesome.  Top Quality.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Sincerely, Doc"
1058,822,3.0,"It works fine if it will reach your equipment, three more inches would be nice.  If it will reach, it's great."
421,822,3.0,"I bought a bunch of these when I started building my pedal board.They're very inexpensive, but seemingly quite high quality.Tons of bang for your buck.Seemingly no tone loss, no added noise, and no coloration.The right angle ends are a little big and bulky, they may not do so well on a tight and jam packed board.But for average boards they work great!I gig and record with these. Great product!Only negative check b/c the ends are too bulky."
1128,822,4.0,I bought a second pair of these. All I gotta say is that they do their job for a good price. Good stuff.
138,822,2.0,With how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky - even for a right angle - but they still sound good.
1305,822,4.0,"nice to get these for ur effects , they are great product , and does exactly what they supposed to, connect Ur pedals,,,great cable , short and useful, also quiet"
290,822,4.0,They are cheap when bought in the 3 pack and they are very quiet. I need to order a couple more packs though!
1034,822,3.0,"I have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables. These are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong. These are currently the only cables I use on my pedalboard. Short of monster or mogami, these are the best you can get for the money."
29,822,3.0,"If you're looking for the perfect patch cables for your effects board, these are it. Very well-manufactured, durable, and reliable, I'll use these again and again"
694,822,4.0,"Worked perfectly for my needs. I don't have a ton of pedals and just needed a few patch cables to connect them all. When it comes to quality of cables, I'm really not to picky about it. I know there's a bunch of gear snobs that turn their noses at anything they consider &#34;inferior&#34; in quality, which usually, from my observation, has to do with cheap affordable prices equaling bad quality and higher end merchandise is always super expensive. If you need some patch cables for your rig, these will do just fine."
1031,822,4.0,"These cables are really the best. They sound perfectly, they look and feel strong, their contact is perfect. Life time warrany. Recommended."
995,822,4.0,These help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board.  They snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality.  Just what I'd expect from the company.
331,822,4.0,"I bought these to chain together some effects pedals for my guitar. They work very well. I don't do too much recording or gigging though, so I'm not sure how well they would work for those activities. But as for as practicing and just messing around at home, these work quite well and you can't beat the price. I've never had them short out and never experienced any humming or noise distortion. I definitely recommend these for anyone looking to chain some pedals together."
183,822,2.0,"Its quality for a small price, good if you are looking for a budget wires.  Overall it is good to buy"
293,822,1.0,"These cables are excellent quality cables, however, if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup, these cables are rather bulky and stiff.The large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer, especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as Hosa."
1231,822,4.0,Great price and quality.  It is nice to not have to connect two pedals 6 inches away with a 10' cable.
1335,822,4.0,"No cable noise, works well with pedals that don't play nice with other right-angle plugs (like the original line of Aguilar pedals). Great little product, and I would buy them again."
1331,822,4.0,This is a really good patch cable. Fits into different brand of pedals well and is really flexible with out feeling like its cheap. I was able to weave it in and out of the Pedaltrain Pro no problem. In fact I've order 4 more sets of these for the rest of my pedals. Highly recommended.
777,822,4.0,"Just like the last reviewer, I also use this to link my MXR/Dunlop pedals together. They are surprisingly well made and I dont notice any signal distortion or drop off in sound at all. No cracklies, nada. I have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords. They are solid, durable, and reliable (and cheap as well).Enjoy!"
911,822,3.0,"for connecting pedals in tandem, got two of these three packs been using them for quite some time and not one has failed yet.  Nice value as well."
1071,822,4.0,Great product. D'Addario always makes great products at great prices. I use these on my pedal board and they are always reliable and cost effective.
81,822,4.0,Great for linking close-quarter effect pedals. No noise and very durable. Great product for the price. I would recommend buying.
323,822,4.0,they connect my pedals and with very little signal kill. good buy for the price and nothing else is required. good quality with sealed connectors.
530,822,3.0,"Needed patch cables for my pedal board.  They did what I expected them to do.  Not to bulky, and the right angle plugs save space."
149,822,4.0,"I bought this planet wave cables because i have a Electro Harmonix OD Glove and a Line 6 M5, so i needed a small cable for both pedals. I highly recomend this model of cables, really works good with pedals and others."
721,167,4.0,I am not a fussy person about guitar strings.  They either sound good or they don't to you and you are the one that matters.  I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door.  There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside.  Martin is at the top of the heap.  These strings sound light and bright. Very pleased with this purchase.
1384,167,4.0,"They are a wonderful product! The lighter the strings on your acoustic the less taxing to the neck of your guitar, with these you can't go wrong."
392,167,4.0,Nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer play/practice periods and less finger fatigue. I would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic. especially good for beginners.
34,682,3.0,"Good grippy picks for some types of playing. I go back and forth between these and the Jazz IIIs when I'm in a Jazz pick kind of mood (i.e.: when I'm not using ginormous Gypsy Jazz picks or Fender heavies. I especially dig Davas (all models) for acoustic playing and strumming. Nice tone as well. Have tried pretty much every Dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing.One thing about Davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip, and I'll pick the string with the rubber. Hand angle can also play a part in this. Probably just me."
804,682,4.0,"I've used Dunlop Jazz III's for years but always had a problem when it came to a song that required a lot of strumming. The DAVA changes that for me. Not only does it allow for accurate picking, but it also allows you to strum when needed - just roll your thumb back a little (works great). I've been using this pick for about 2 months now and have not gone back to any of my other picks. A definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick!!! You won't be dissapointed!!!"
1323,682,4.0,"Have been a user of Jazz III picks lately (Max Grip version:Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks - 6 Pack) but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strumming.Was recommended to these picks by other users so I gave them a shot. A few of my notes:- This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above. I like this a lot. The tip is almost exactly the same size, but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger. Still, these picks are significantly smaller than your ""average"" size pick.- The rubber grip area is a joy to hold. Very comfortable, very stable, lots of grip- If you didn't know, Dava picks dont come in varying thickness. They are instead ""control"" picks. Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid. Look at the picture --- see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick? Those are reference markers --- choke up on the pick (lowest line near the tip) for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming. This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory. However, even choking up on the pick, it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii.- These Dava Jazz come in three colors: Red (Delrin material), Yellow (Nylon material), Orange (Gel). Different materials produce different sounds/feels. Also, in my opinion, the gel is a little harder than the other two.Hope this review helped"
398,682,4.0,"Title says it all I guess, it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness (that I'm not crazy about in Dunlops), and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands. Bought these 3 months ago and I've got to say they're very durable too, certainly more so than the small-pick alternatives I tried."
1083,682,3.0,"These picks have a good grip.  They're pointy, so they're good for fast picking.  They're very small, about the size of a nickle, so you've been warned.  As with other Dava picks, they wear out pretty quickly.  That's the price you pay for a flexible pick I guess."
774,682,4.0,"A very nice pick, both in feel, texture and design. I picked it up and started strumming and immediately felt something different - something smoother and more comfortable, more natural. I'm very satisfied with this pick! There's a cheeky little message on the label, &#34;Warning: may improve your playing&#34; and that's no joke! Only complaint is that it's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece, where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece. But that's okay. I got this the same time as I got a set of Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III, the yellowish ones, and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks, and I think I like this one the best. All three are &#34;tight grip&#34; picks, and all the same size, but I'd say that I like this one the best of the three (they're all good, though - I'd rate the 427P3 next-best, and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that).One complaint - they sent mine in a bloody great big oversized padded envelope suitable for CDs. Kind of overkill, if you ask me, for only six picks, but I shouldn't complain - they arrived in great condition!!!"
1013,419,4.0,"While I have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting.  After using the Zoom H4N for a few weeks I've found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster's arsenal of gear.I mainly use the H4N to record my podcasts using a Allen & Heath ZED14 mixing board.  I usually do a two person podcast where I am in one location and the other person is brought in via Skype.  Using the Aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the H4N I can record myself in one channel, the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my iPad into its own stereo channel.  This makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track.The sound quality of the H4N is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit.  You can hook up either two XLR microphones or two 1/4&#34; jack sources (or a combination) to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1/8&#34; input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source.  It's the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracks.The H4N will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well, which could be useful if you're looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed.Overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field, letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments.  Five stars without a doubt."
1419,419,1.0,"I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2's performance most significant where I couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the Line In jack.  Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad.  If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal.  It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it.  I contacted Zoom's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit.  I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.I really like the H4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized.  It feels more sturdy than the H2.  The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent.  Most other recorders in this price range don't have XLR inputs.  Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it for.  I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems.  I've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem.  If you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice.  I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, It is a nice recorder and I'm very happy with it."
1339,419,3.0,"4 stars because I've only used it in stereo mode and Stamina mode. Stamina Mode is supposed to run for 11 hours. Perhaps it does, but if so, it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode. No one records 11 hours straight, so I'm guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner. If not for that, I'd have rated 4 stars. In terms of clarity, flat response and transparency, it is excellent. The Auto Rec level is very smooth and doesn't sound as if has been severely limited and squashed. At rehearsals, before the whole band kicks in, the levels are quite loud, but it comes down quickly and smoothly. In terms of the other features, I cannot comment."
1097,419,4.0,"This thing has so many uses its ridiculous.  I mostly use it to record live band rehearsals, and it's pretty amazing at that.  I've also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a USB interface for my DAW when my other interface went kaput.  If you are using this for film, music, field recording you will be very happy.  Easy to use interface and very well constructed."
129,419,4.0,Pros:1) records excellent audio through built in mics2) records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile.3) I love the 4 track ability and the effects built in to the device.  I can record multiple things in less time especially when I'm just messing around to get a feel for a song4) comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box.Cons:1) battery life is weak2) built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want.
1361,419,4.0,"Yes!!!! finally...after reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders I hit the nail!!!! Ok..I play in a really LOUD metal band...none of us are record savvy or anything like that...we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out. But we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember ""that riff"" for the next rehearsal. We tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice, well the ZOOM H4N changed everything. Simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just....well INCREDIBLE...for such a little thing...no distortion of any kind (just be careful where you place it). I still need to read a lot of the users manual...but take my word...I hate those manuals...I figure how to use it (extremely basic) and just hit the REC button and rock out. Finally when I came back home I plug it into my pc and I was amazed by the quality of the sound...we recorded in 4CH mode with two extra mics...and man....I havent even tried the multi channel mode yet!!!thanks ZOOM...now rocking and basic recording it's how it's supposse to be....SIMPLE AND FUN.cheers!!!"
989,419,4.0,"I own both the H1 and H4n and I love them both. The H4n is a great versatile field recorder. I mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. The H4n is a work horse. It has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. I highly recommend purchasing a ""furry head"" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.Unlike the H1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the H4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. However, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. I had this happen once. If this happens to you, don't worry. I searched the internet and was able to find several Zoom certified service centers within my general area. I called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the H4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; I didn't pay a dime. I had it shipped off and back in 7 days.All in all the H4n is a great field recorder. I mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 Chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two XLR inputs at the same time. In some cases I also use a small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer if I have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. Running straight from the mixer outputs to the H4n works perfectly.I do suggest some accessories when using the H4n. As I said earlier, purchase a ""furry head"" wind screen. I use the furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. I only use 32gb Sandisk SD cards because Sandisk is dependable, I have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. I record at 48K @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. This allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case I forget to transfer the audio files along with video when I edit. I also suggest having a DI box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. I have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a DI Box from venue mixers. This has to do with a balance and padding that I am just not going to get into but trust me, a DI box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. I also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. Always be prepared. I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries and I have never had any issues. Battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.I do not regret this purchase at all. The H4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. I highly recommend purchasing one."
1406,419,3.0,Great Recorder on so many levels.I use it for external audio recording for DSLR video.I was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics.Dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible.Not intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functions.Something I will have to get used to.
827,419,3.0,"Overall, as with most Zoom products, this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by it's competition in it's price category except for perhaps the Olympus LS11 which is cheaper but the Zoom has a ton more features.Build quality is good, features are good (the only unit in it's price range to have combi XLR / 1/4"" TRS inputs) and it records to a high quality.However, I think Zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it THE BEST digital recorder under a grand and making it a great USB digital interface instead of spending money on the 4 track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works O.K. but is much more easily realized in a simple digital 4 track recorder (e.g a Tascam PocketStudio)The manual is a farse in Japanese /English translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit (although it's fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices - I gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus, but the unit is still a little 'fiddly' to operate in advanced modes.My last comment is in regards to the H4n as a USB interface. I have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface. First of all it is only 16 bit and I can only get it to work with MME drivers. I have read that there are some ASIO drivers available for Windows 7 but I use XP. I may try to use ASIO4all but it is still only 16 bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work. There is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a DAW software (I have only tried it with Cakewalk Sonar). I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly I can't seeing it being of much use in this regard.However, overall the unit is stellar and I highly recommend it.PS. I read some folks having issues with line inputs (e.g. recording a stereo mix from a mixer). I personally don't see the problem, the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types. If it is not working for your situation one can always use a TRS Hi Z unbalanced to XLR Low Z balanced converter, available at Radio Shack for around 20 bucks."
957,627,4.0,"This pedal has tone! its very easy to use and program, I did not have idea on how to use it, and really quick I got it, it has a great interface, it sounds great, you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no time.The distrosion is great some people say they arent but I really love them, its a matter of  taste and creating your tones, some preset may not be good for youThe downside it does not have the AC adapter but I knew this.The lights under certain light conditions are very bright,But this pedal is note heavy, well constructed and sturdy, I got the AC adapter so I dont have to be on the batteries all the time.This pedal has the whole package, effects, great tone, great distorsion and cleans."
207,627,0.0,"The Boss ME-70 is not as nice as the BOSS GT-10 and will not let you install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  I recommend getting a BOSS GT-10 and then install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Now your guitar can sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg."
1175,627,2.0,"I agree with other reviews that Boss exploits its customers by insisting the $300 pedal have the PSA supply, but sells it separately.  It's a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it.  I used a OneSpot power supply I had already, and it works fine.  Just glad I didn't have to shell out $20 more to Boss for something they should have provided with the ME70.The first thing I noticed is that the tuner is not too good.  You get a letter, with an arrow on each side, and it's not very responsive.The Korg-style dial-in reverb controls are easy, but extremely limited.  Expected better.  You get either room or hall.  Neither are that realistic.Going from manual patch-level to bank-level is awkward.  It may just take practice.Next thing I noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected.  If I set the E. level (delayed signal level, or balance) at around thirty, it can be clearly heard.  When overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected, but the delayed signal remains at the original volume, effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudible.Did Boss just start making multi-effects pedals?  Have they learned nothing?Despite somewhat mediocre performance and design, the ME70 does have features that recommend it.  Some of the drives are usable.  The controls are accessible and easy to adjust.  The ""Solo"" setting on the Comp/FX module is a nice booster, although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the OD/DS module - maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boost.The next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches.  I was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting, but all it does is turn the preamp on and off, or step (one way) through the presents (FS-5U).It almost appears that Boss very cynically crippled the ME70 so it did not threaten GT10 sales.I'm looking forward to learning more about this pedal.  So far, it does some good things, but it could be much better.Has anyone else noticed the ME70 reviews out there aren't too useful?  I'm thinking of checking out the Vox Tonelab EX, which is being blown out now.  $225 at GC, for example.--3/16/12 update:  Despite the limitations above, I like the portability of this unit.  It runs on 6 AA's (I think) which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play, for example at a jam where you don't have power nearby.New Fail update - the Tremolo in this unit just stinks.  I mean stinks.  Whatever the ""waveform"" is, it's not a sine wave, not smooth at all.  Very poor musical characterists.  Whatever engineer was in charge of this - you screwed up big time.  Your own Boss tremolo pedals are much better than what you've put in the ME70.  Why would you do that, Boss?  I like tremolo but it's virtually useless in this unit.  Some people won't notice, but if you like that swampy Fender style tremolo, you will be very disappointed."
783,627,4.0,"I've stayed away from multi-effect pedals for years, because I spent more time messing with it, then playing guitar. I could never get the levels right. The Boss ME-70 is easy to use. It sounds great. 72 patches in all. My current band does not even play that many songs."
1324,627,4.0,"I'm a professional musician, playing 6-8 times a month.  This pedal does far more than I need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles.  I really like the 38 second looping function.....that's plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases, and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative.  Don't forget to order the external power supply - I would have happily paid a little extra money to have it included....not sure why it's not.  Double A batteries last a longer time than I expected they would.  I haven't had a chance to play with customizing patches, etc, but I'm sure that I'll be pleased with what it has to offer."
149,627,4.0,"Excellent Multi-Effect, great sounds, the distortions are really great. Modulation and Delays rocks, they sound good. Like always, Boss products are just amazing."
1281,627,4.0,"As an ""Old School"" Guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous. With a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual Boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at & definitely too large for our practice studio (and a bit too heavy to lug around).I researched every multi-effect unit on the market today & decided the ME-70 was the best way to go for me mainly for the ""Manual"" settings. When I received the unit, it came out of the box ready to go (other than installing batteries) and worked exactly like I had my ""rig"" shrunk down into a rugged small package.COSM- With the amp simulation & Pre-Amp portion I don't need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knob.Effects- Boss is ""THE BOSS"" of effect pedals in my opinion... this unit combines everything I need & then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking. I do not venture into the unit's ability to remember settings because every venue I gig at has different acoustics & constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones I want to hear."
249,613,4.0,"I purchased this mic to use for screencasts (recording what's happening on my PC's screen while I talk about it).  I set it up to sit on my desktop, approximately 2' away from me and usedCamtasia Studio 8 [Download] and a free program called CamStudio to test it out.  Both programs worked well with the mic and did what I'd hoped it would do - eliminated my need for a clunky, wired mic headset.The build quality of the mic seems excellent, and the compact design is fantastic!  I love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop's monitor.KINKS IN MY SYSTEM: MUFFLED AUDIOThe included software: Cakewalk's Music Creator LE can be installed on one computer.  You get 30 days to register it.  I installed it and registered it immediately, but it would not allow me to put in my registration code, saying I wasn't the system administrator.  I am, and my Windows 7 PC says I am, but alas, it wouldn't work.  This software is optional, but I decided to install it prior to the microphone (per instructions) to try it out.  Eventually I ended up uninstalling it.Soon after installing Cakewalk, I had a PC issue: muffled audio recording.  No amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it.  I was stumped.Then I decided to go to the Samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic.  The generic ones installed were from 2010.  No luck.I began reading online about 'muffled audio' on Windows 7 PCs.  Somewhere I noticed a name I recognized: RealTek, which was a name associated with my speakers on my PC (RealTek digital audio).  I went to the RealTek site and noted updated drivers for Windows 7 64-bit (2012), and decided to download and install them.  I rebooted my PC and tested out the audio recording once more. Much to my delight, this solved the muffled audio problem!I did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording.  Afterwards I tested out the mic using Camtasia and CamStudio, both worked beautifully with the Samson Go Mic!On my desk at a distance of about 2.5', this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts.  No hiss, hum, breath noises or distortion.  Very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio - works perfectly with the USB 2.0 connection on my powered USB hub.CONCLUSION: BUY IT FOR GREAT RECORDINGSThis mic is a truly great if it's recognized and properly configured by your system.  Impressively clear recordings, unlike any I've been able to obtain using aPlantronics .Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headsetor the mic on myMicrosoft LifeCam Cinema 720p HD Webcam - Black.For the price, I don't think you can do better.  It's compact, has great voice pick-up and audio recording clarity. Installation issues may occur, but updating audio drivers, using a powered USB hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you've been hoping for at a price that's right.UPDATE: 12/30/13Been using this mic consistently for a couple months and I'm liking it.  It's a condenser mic, and doesn't filter out ambient noise as well as I'd like, however for an under forty dollar purchase - I'm still very happy with it. Cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so I uninstalled it.  I guess if anything, that's been the downside to this purchase."
1408,613,4.0,"For 30 bucks this mic is great! I have garage band and needed a mic for voice and room recording, well this mic does it and them some. The different modes are distinct and perfect from podcast to vocals and for room jams . It comes with a long cable, rotating bad, and a nice carry case that fits in my pocket. BUY this mic, for 30bucks you will,be surprised"
837,613,4.0,"I purchased one of these about 6 months ago for my partner who is a musician because we had no recording equipment in the house. We didn't really expect much except a quick way to record ideas.It's simple, easy to use and has outstanding quality of sound. We've used it to record acoustic guitar and vocals with surprisingly good fidelity. We've recorded whole ensemble practice sessions with the mic which it's really not designed for and still had reasonable results. Our friends who are musicians ( and even an audio engineer) are quite surprised and impressed with the quality of sound we get.I've even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype.To sum it up, this mic is cheap, easy to use, portable and with fidelity that will surprise you but don't expect it to be a full home recording studio :)"
800,613,4.0,"The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do.  The mic has a headphone jack.  Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings. Also, I like having the two polar patterns, switchable from cardioid to omni.I did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic, as my voice is powerful.  Once, I got the hang of it I had no problems.I did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless.  Please refer to my review of"" Cakewalk Music Creator 6"" here on amazon.com.  It works great with my new ""Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5.""Overall, this is an awesome product."
1067,613,3.0,"My first reaction on opening the box that this came in was &#34;Gee, it's a lot smaller than I expected.&#34; It looks like a CAD Equitek E100S but it's a fraction of the size. I'd even say it was cute. But how does it perform?I have two microphones I use for recording at my computer: A Blue Yeti USB electret mic, and a Sampson SAMTR101A. Of the two, the Yeti is closer in design, as it uses an electret capsule and a built-in USB interface, like the Go Mic, so that's what I compared it to. I fired up Garage Band and plugged both microphones into the computer (a four year old iMac) so I could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks with acoustic guitar, ukulele, and double bass.Right off the bat I was impressed with the Go Mic's lack of latency; it was as good as the Yeti- maybe better. There was no perceptible delay.  No need to find a special driver, either. Plug it in and it's ready to go. There's even a headphone jack in the mic- something unusual in a package this tiny. Sound was good, too, though perhaps not as uncolored as the Yeti. I tried all three modes: Carodid, Carodid + -10bD pad, and Omni. Omni gave the best, clearest sound, not unexpectedly, but it was hard to get a good level when close miking. No matter how I backed down the volume in Garage Band I got clipping. Using the -10dB pad I was able to get some acceptable levels from a few feet away. Best sound on all instruments was obtained from 6-10 feet using the Omni mode.It has one advantage over the Yeti: It's very modest in current requirements, so I can run it directly off my iPad. The two together make a nice portable recording/production combination. Packaging is well thought out, too. The mic is permanently attached via a swivel  to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand, and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection. And if that's not enough, there's a separate case to keep dust and dirt out of the mic.While the Go Mic wouldn't be my first choice for recording music, it would be a very acceptable one for recording musical ideas on the go, and perfectly acceptable for voice recording, podcasting, or Skyping."
1083,613,4.0,"This mic works great for recording vocals on my Mac using Garage Band.  I also wanted to use it on my Xbox 360 to play Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but it's not recognized by either game as a mic.  That was surprising since it's a USB mic.  It is a tiny mic; it'll fit completely on your palm, but it can record very loud noises very clearly. It is also very sensitive when set to room recording. Excellent product."
318,613,3.0,"Having misplaced my Blue Snowflake USB mic, I decided to give this recently introduced, competitively priced USB mic from Samson a try.  (Samson is maker of the highly popular and effective Zoom personal digital recorders--the H2 and the H4n.)  It's an attractive, fully outfitted piece of equipment, with handsome packaging (a small black box and zippered carrying case with aesthetics apparently inspired by iPod).  It's smaller and lighter than the Snowflake--more diminutive than the picture would suggest.  Yet the audio quality strikes me as being somewhat warmer and richer, favoring the bass frequencies of spoken narration more than the Snowflake, which has slightly cleaner and clearer definition at the treble end.The Samson Go was seen instantly by my iMac, and recording was as advertised: ""Plug n' Play.""  The mic is somewhat more sophisticated than the Snowflake in terms of ""latency"" settings (it permits direct monitoring via headphones connected to the mic to insure no delay, or lag time, between transmission and reception), and there's a three-way switch for directional patterns (the manual could be clearer, however, about the difference between ""cardioid"" and ""cardioid 10 pad."")  No matter. The mic performed virtually flawlessly right out of the box, with no tampering with the switch.It's extremely sensitive, slightly more so than the Snowflake.  Yet I was unable to avoid the ""P"" popping sounds, regardless of how close I got to the mic and muted my consonants.  So be prepared for the addition of some sort of ""pop filter"" device (either one sold on Amazon or a self-designed one, using a nylon stocking).The mic can be clipped to the top of a computer screen or mounted on a mic stand (using a supplied adapter or ordering a properly sized one from Samson).  Yet with its heavy base plus the flexible, tilting mic, it can be placed on a flat surface--much like the Snowflake, but with greater stability and without any intrusive cable.  (The Snowflake tends to ""flop around,"" requiring some balancing of the device by the user.)My biggest disappointment thus far is that the clip, as alluded to by another reviewer, does not open far enough for attachment to a desk-top computer (it should be an ideal fit with most notebook machines).  Although the Snowflake doesn't use a spring clip, it suffers from the same limitation.  If you're especially concerned about durability, the Snowflake appears to be the heavier, more rugged mic, with thick metal and no tiny switches or spring clips to wear out.  The Samson is the more delicate and refined of the two.  But don't kid yourself.  Either mic will exceed the capabilities of your computer's built-in mic and perhaps the owner's expectations. On the other hand, neither is a match for the Shure SM7B that I'm accustomed to using at a local broadcasting studio.  Still, Samson would appear to have a winner with this little wonder, whether it's used in conjunction with a computer to record full-frequencied music or ""realistic""-sounding narration."

705,568,4.0,Works good.good buy
515,568,3.0,"Just got this in this week. Looks nice and works as intended. For 22 bucks, can't really go wrong. I use this with a Behringer C1 and have had no trouble getting it to fit. It's a bit snug, but I would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit."
905,568,1.0,"I really wanted this to be a great product.  The screws strip out too easily.  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.  Not much of anything is worth the money these days.  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products.  Why should they?  They already have your money.  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up.  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place.  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage.  Whatever, don't buy one.  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business.  What would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s):  Did you test this product?  How did you test it?  What were your results?  Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?Nope"
810,568,4.0,"Great mount for the price. Filter attached to mount is great idea, saves space and simplifies mic stand setup. Quality good, especially given fairly low price."
924,568,4.0,"I'm loving this pop filter! It looks professional in design, and feels very sturdy on the mic stand. The built in shock mount is definitely a plus. I like it because some beginners try to grab the mic in the studio when recording vocals. This immediately let's them know to just speak into the microphone. Also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want. Amazon was great in conjunction with the seller! My item arrived lightning fast! Amazon is like music to my ears, and that's why their products are in my studio. Simply THE BOMB!!!!!"
926,568,4.0,"Believe it or not, I've yet to use this screen. I was short a shock mount for one of my Cad condensers. I've yet to use that mic again. Go figure. But I love the way screen and mount look? I know. So esoteric. But I'm still giving it 5 stars. Thanks again Amazon."
1167,205,4.0,It's no better or worse than a tripod stand at twice the cost. this is a good deal! Note: it does not come with a microphone clip so you will have to buy one.
1030,205,4.0,"i got this stand and it simply works and look awesome, exactly what i was looking for, and for the price i can not get a better deal.totally satisfied!"
837,205,3.0,I got mine for less than 20 bucks. The stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended. Other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle. We have a more expensive stand of the same type with exactly the same feature and no problems with either.
1124,205,0.0,"As soon as I attached my mic, and with my strong hands, I over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand.  I think I can fix it with some liquid metal, but this is not as impressive as some mic stands I've had in the past.  Sincerely, DocAfter a few months of trying to make it work.  It doesn't.  I changed my rating from 3 to 1  This puppy is just poor quality."
1165,205,4.0,For the money you can not beat this. The quality is great for the money. I mainly use this at home for my project studio but have used it in a professional studios a few times. The stands my studio uses are a lot more expensive then this but work just the same. The only difference is obvious that this stand my not last for ever with everyday use in a professional enviorment. I see this stand lasting me for at least five or six years at home.
1168,205,4.0,These mic stands worked perfectly.  The fold down pretty small so you could fit a couple of them in most travel bags.  Easy to adjust.
448,205,0.0,"I have three mic stands, with this one being the fourth. I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1. The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2. The bottom clamp never did secure properly. It kept opening up even without a mic on it. The weight of the stand itself stripped it.I sent it back without hesitation."
708,205,4.0,"I bought many professional mic stands through the years, before this item, and I can not tell the difference. Well built, made to last, and looks great. I highly recommend this item."
942,579,4.0,"These are pretty good quality tweed cables.  I prefer the tweed, they seem not to tangle as easy and they are usually very easy to identify at gigs.  They also make one with the 90 degree 1/4 inch input as well."
40,579,4.0,"I've owned a lot of cables over the years, and most have been junk.  For the money, there is no better instrument cable out there than the Spectraflex.  I've regularly rolled 100-pound half stacks over them, jumped up and down on them, and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements, and they stay clean and work like the first day.Pros:- Proper shielding means this is a quiet, accurate cable- Slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle- Very flexible- Metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen- Available in some very cool colors- Lifetime warrantyCons:- None to speak of.Spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today.  A lifetime warranty means you'll have it forever."
1076,579,4.0,"This cable is a great cable for the price.Flexible, good tone, good quality.I move around alot on stage and I need cables that will keep up with me and not bind up.Great product"
729,579,3.0,"It sure is a pretty looking cable out of the box. The chord works great, no noticeable buzz. I had to have the tweed, to complement my vintage gear. I'd have given this a 5 star rating, but because of the tweed/fabric outer, the chord is constantly fighting you with kinks."
936,579,4.0,"Very well made cable but I had to return it for a longer one of the same as this was a little to short, but very well made ."
516,579,4.0,"I have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly. What I love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path, and have some nice touches in the way they are made.One of those 'nice touches' is a strain relief at both ends, which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can (and will) introduce noise and static eventually. The plugs are also of the highest quality. They mate perfectly with 1/4"" receptacles on guitars and amps.I mentioned that these are for inside playing. What I mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete, cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface. That is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is made.Otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality, price and performance. Get one as a spare if for no other reason because I think you will be pleased with it."
754,579,4.0,"Let me say this is a a great cable in every aspect.First, it works extremely well.  No popping or clicking at all.  Very flexible but solid feel to it.  It looks better in person than in the pic too.  And with the lifetime guarantee, you really can't go wrong here."
1081,754,4.0,"I use the 21' cable. Great build quality, looks professional, sturdy plugs, and most importantly it sounds great! I like the smooth fabric sleeve, it doesn't stick to things like a plastic/rubber cable can."
1038,754,4.0,This a great instrument cable. If all you have ever used have been rubber covered try this one. The fabric cover eliminates the knots and twists of &#34;regular&#34; cables.
92,754,3.0,"This is one great looking cable. I purchased this cable December 2010 and it is still working well and stilllooks good. And as Fernando Lamas says, ""it is better to look good than to feel good"". Well, not when itcomes to cables.This cable is 20 AWG, with an ""Ultra-Pure Copper Center Conductor"" and 100% copper and conductivepolymer shield. You want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud. Helps keep those ugly micro-phonics away and you want that big time.The capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pF/ft. This is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables. The lower the number, the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable.Out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output. It seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed. This seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money.This cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style. They look terrific but I find this ""Fatso"" muchharder to coil than the thinner Spectraflex 'Vintage' this company makes. The bulkiness of this cabledoesn't seem to lend itself to easy coiling. It also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage. The easiest of my cables to coil, by the way, is the Lava Cable,""Magma"", which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil. If I were to need more cable, quitehonestly I would buy the Lava. Pretty doesn't count for much with me.I gave this cable 4 stars because of its very good sound, is well constructed, has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs, looks darn marvelous, and has about average specs for the money. Yet, difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis.If you want a beautiful, well made cable that you don't have to put away every day buy this one."
417,754,4.0,"For many years I've been playing with Proel and &#34;Fender&#34; cables... until I start having problems with guitar jacks and connection efficiency. This guys put an end to the problem with high quality components. Best of all, Warranty For Life... or maybe longer."
494,754,4.0,"This is my first experience with a ""high end"" guitar cord after playing for longer than I'd like to admit.  For many years i've been playing with any old shielded solid core cord without regard for much besides price.  In prep for an upcoming gig, I bought 2 Spectraflex Fatso 18' right angle cords.  I find them to be very well made, with shrink tubing sealed strain reliefs at the high quality plugs, thick and heavy duty cabling (but not too think nor too heavy), and best of all, very quiet, presumably because of superior shielding.  They were what I consider expensive (about $38 each), but for me, well worth the price, and considerably less than many other high end cables I found and read about.  I imagine that they will last for years.  I think I will eventually replace all my dozen or so cords of various lengths with these.J.M. Tepper"
1353,754,4.0,"This cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect, clean sound. Absolutely love this! This is definitely recommendable."
1144,754,3.0,I've used this for about 3 months now.  No malfunctions. Looks good. Works fine.  No complaints. What more can I say?
98,633,4.0,"I am really liking the size of this board. I have a Line6 G50 wireless, Korg Pitchblack+, Xotic EP booster and Xotic SP compressor and they all fit very nicely. The board itself is very sturdy steel with good welds and nice straight angles. The case is also really well made- good zippers and stitching.  I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."
13,633,2.0,"Is this guraunteed for life or something?  it should be for the price.  it is very basic, tube construction with very little for wire and cable guidance and clean up.  I would not buy another one at the prices they charge, but then, I am handy enough to make my own if I wanted to.  The carry bag is very nice, the extra pocket for cables and things holds a lot of stuff.  They show a lot more pedals than I could fit on it, they must be smaller pedals than the ones I can find and the perhaps have those magical patch cables that take no space in between.  If you look at the picture there appears to room for 6 pedals but 5 is all you will get.  I have a Boss RX-20 double pedal looper, and 2 other Boss pedal on board and that is all than can fit with patch cables."
1388,633,3.0,"I only had this board for a day, after realizing it was a tab too narrow for the pedal setup I wanted to create on it. I do have to say though, Pedaltrain makes rock solid products. Sure, you could probably fashion your own pedalboard, but why bother? This thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro."
1369,633,4.0,"I love pedal trains because they are lightweight, come with a case and are easy to work with.  If pedaltrain asked me my opinion I would say that they needed to raise the back up about 1-2&#34; to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use, but other than that, its a pedaltrain...nuff said!"
330,633,4.0,"This pedalboard is very solid, durable, and easy to pack in their soft case - which I love especially because it makes my pedalboard and some extras much easier to carry to and from gigs. There is space below the pedalboard for cables to run and the velco and glue they provide to keep the pedals on the board are very reliable. The MINI is the perfect size for me but overall I've been very pleased with Pedaltrain in general."
383,633,4.0,"I know the kind of person I am - If I buy a big pedal board, I'll have to spend hundreds of dollars to fill it up with great effects. Buy a smaller board and I can be selective in the pedals I buy and save $$ by not trying to fill it. Hence, the purchase of the Pedaltrain Mini.This board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply. When I initially purchased it, I was hoping that I could fit the power supply under the board, but I tried a few small power units from Guitar Center and none would fit and allow the board to lay flush. I should probably ding one star for this and it would be a great improvement if pedaltrain would just raise the board about 1/8"" to allow for the power to be mounted under the board.The unit is VERY sturdy and ships with velcro to secure pedals to the top. The velcro feels like it's military grade and does a great job of securing the pedals. It's light, easy to carry, and I can grab the case in one hand, with my guitar in the same hand, and carry my amp with the other hand (only one trip from the car to the gig).Overall, this is a great board. I currently have a looper, overdrive, distortion, echo and tuner on my unit. I've added a photo of my board."
947,633,3.0,"I'm so glad I bought this instead of some of the cheaper, plastic pedalboards out there.  The board itself is made out of welded metal and it's very sturdy.  The velcro seems to be of decent quality, too.  Even the bag is nice.The single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the fact that it clips onto the bag in weird places basically makes it worthless.  My advice is to a) definitely buy the pedal train mini and b) toss the shoulder strap in a drawer somewhere and never look at it again.I'm using this unit for my bass gear: a SansAmp programmable bass driver DI, a compressor, a tuner..and possibly an envelope filter at some point."
1018,633,4.0,"What a nice product. Rugged and well made. The supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs.I was able to build a pedal board with a tuner, delay, distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare. It looks very neat and tidy. Using George L's makes it look even better.I will buy one of these again. These things rock!** EDIT - 10-25-2012 **Still a great little board but I found Power Grip Pedal Board Velcro - this board that the new velcro make this an unstopable unit."
1010,434,3.0,"This is a review for theMahalo U-30PK Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele (Pink).For the price ($30 shipped) it can't be beat.  Free shipping via Amazon Prime.  I got it for my 3yo daughter for christmas, and she loves it!  I taught her the C-chord, and I play the G-chord... so we play the Moldy Peaches ""Anyone else but you.""  It's a great little starter musical instrument, and a great beater uke that I don't mind getting a bit banged up.I was surprised that the frets were level and the neck was straight (well, good enough for a cheap uke).  The strings are some kind of cheap nylon.  I changed the strings to nylguts, and they sound 1000x better... almost as good as my other laminate mahogany soprano (almost).  The fretboard is painted black, so I don't know what kind of wood was used (I didn't expect ebony for this price).  I also sanded down the nut and saddle because the action was a bit high, and now even I can play it without complaining too much.  It has geared tuners, not friction pegs.It even comes with a matching polyester ""gig-bag.""  Now my mother wants one so she can play with her granddaughter.  Overall, a decent play/starter uke and worth the $30."
741,434,3.0,"For the price, this is a steal. If you can, snag a pack of new strings and it will sound tremendously better. All in all with new strings I only spent about $30 on this uke and I think that is more than fair.If you can't get new strings, the ones that come on it will survive you a little while (but stock strings on any instrument are never great). Also, if you don't know how to to tune an instrument/don't have a tuner, you don't need to buy one; if you have a smartphone or iPod touch there are accurate tuning apps for nearly any instrument, ukulele included!A little back story: I used to play instruments when I was younger but stopped in my preteens/early teens. It's something I've recently been regretting more than ever. So, I'm fixing that! Not only am I relearning the instruments I played before, but I picked up a new one - the ukulele! Like many others, I was inspired by Amanda Palmer to do so ;)Back to the review!:The sound of the ukulele is great. It's not too tinny like a lot of cheap instruments are. After a week or so it has no trouble staying in tune and rarely needs adjustments. It's very lightweight (which is good) but I don't think it would survive a fall. It's a fingerprint magnet, but that's about the only gripe I have. I plan on sticker'ing and painting it anyway :) The gig bag, as other as said, is basically just a dust jacket. I'm cool with that because that says to me that the majority of the money I spent on this ukulele really was for the ukulele, not the extras!For the price, this ukulele more than serves its purpose. I was worried that I'd regret not shelling out another $20 or $30 for a more frequently recommended ukelele, but I don't regret it at all.It's pretty easy to learn, especially if you have the littlest bit of musical knowledge or experience. Even if you don't, it shouldn't take you too long to be playing some songs! You have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere!This ukelele is perfect for a beginner or for someone who wants a cheap backup or travel option. Plus, it's not costly so if it breaks/gets lost/stolen/you choose to upgrade, you haven't lost a whole lot of money.This would also be great for kids who want to learn an instrument. My little brother has been nagging me to get him a ukulele since I got one!That's about all! I will update if any problems arise in time.Don't hesitate. If you're new, don't worry about spending $50+ on something else (I mean, if you can and want to, go ahead!). This will be more than fine.Edit: Apparently, this thing fluctuates between $20-30. I was $24.95 when I got it. If it's $30, wait a few days and see if it goes down. I mean, it's worth the money but if you can save a little and spent that extra $5 on a new pack of strings, that would be even better.(I give it 4 stars and not 5 simply because while I have not played other ukuleles, I am certain that there ARE better. That's just how it is. The more $ you spend, the better. But this is definitely pretty solid over all for what it is and how much it costs!)"
696,434,4.0,"I have acoustic guitar experience to a novice level, but I have also wanted to learn the Ukulele for quite some time. As I had never so much as touched a ukulele before buying this one, I looked for a low-cost soprano to see whether I would enjoy playing such a similar looking but very different sounding and smaller instrument.Upon receiving this item, I tuned it up and had a little play using a few basic chords I learned. The Uke sounded acceptable, but I was (slightly) disappointed by the sound of the default supplied strings. Also at first (as I expected), the Ukelele went badly out of tune quickly when playing, but after a few hours the strings broke in and now keep their tuning with only occasional minor tweaks required.Of course, most cheap ukuleles come with fairly terrible (and cheap) strings so it would be wrong of me to be too critical when this instrument cost so little. I have now ordered some Aquila strings from Amazon to replace the default strings - i.e. I bought theAquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings. I am still waiting for delivery on these, and will update this review when I eventually fit them as to the difference it makes, (which I expect will be a significant improvement in sound based upon my research.) To be honest though, the default strings on this ukulele aren't *too* bad so I may wait a while to install the Aquilla strings until I can play more competently and get the benefit of them!As far as the design and quality of this ukulele goes, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. The paint-job was blemish free and well done, the unit appears to have been assembled well using adequate components, and the tuner backs on the reverse of the headstock are decorative little gold dolphins, which is a nice touch. The unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument.For the money it costs, it is difficult to voice any serious gripes at all with this ukulele. I'm very much looking forward to getting more competent with the instrument over the coming months. I really couldn't imagine giving this ukulele anything less than a full five stars - it's great."
1333,434,4.0,Great starter Uke. got this for my wife she just loves it. Stays in tune. good sound.The price was right.
299,434,2.0,"The U-30 is a decent starter's ukulele, no matter what color you get, but it is not without its flaws. The tuners feel cheap, but they are functional, much better than friction tuners on ""toy"" ukuleles. The body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease, but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers. The string action is low, making it perfect for fast strum patterns. Even for a soprano ukulele, this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain, which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more ""Hawaiian"" sound, but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic, unless using a microphone. The worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings, it takes forever to stretch them or ""break them in."" This means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song, so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner. Chords that use the first fret, such as F and A sound distorted for some reason. Replacing the included strings with Aquila strings makes this ukulele much better, but the added cost puts it in the price range of what I would consider a true starter's ukulele, the Lanikai LU-11. The included gig bag is almost useless, it has absolutely no padding and is very tight. In conclusion, its low price and distinctive high pitch ""Hawaiian"" sound make up for its shortcomings. I would not recommend this as your only ukulele, or even a starter, since the problems with first fret chords will train your ear in a wrong way. I would recommend the U-30 as a backup or ""disposable"" ukulele that you can take anywhere, without fear of damaging or losing it, but for a little more money, you can get better."
879,434,2.0,"I should have researched this a little bit more. It was a gift for a child, but a child couldn't tune this thing nor could I! It was a toy, not an instrument."
893,434,4.0,My kids are all interested in learning the Uke.  This one really appealed to my son because of the front design.  Plays well and keeps in tune.
662,434,4.0,"I recently ordered this ukulele and 4 others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few options.Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard - NaturalDiamond Head DU-150 Ukulele, NaturalMahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele (Orange)Lanikai LU-11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina, Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under $30 at the time and within $2 price of each other.  Of the three, I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality.  The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles (which had the original strings).  A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly, but even then, the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level.The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice (for this price) little gig bag.  Incidentally, what the Mahalo product description says is a ""color-matching brown gigbag"" ended up being black, but black is pretty standard gig bag color.  The Mahalo has the most ""island"" look to my eyes and the best sound.  Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head's.  That being said, it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it's so near the same price (compared to the  Diamond Head) and has better strings already installed.  I've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages."
962,434,2.0,"I guess I did not expect much, since it was so cheap. Just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this. I got it for my son, and he wasn't impressed. Does not have good sound, but hey...if you're just wanting a toy, go for it."

Worth noting is that you will need to tune the ukulele each time you play for the first few weeks until the strings are &#34;broken in&#34;, but from what I've read and gathered, this is par for the course. Lastly, if you're going to order one, I suggest pairing it with a pack of felt picks. Cheers!"
925,405,2.0,"I've owned several multi-effect pedals in the past, even one Digitech.  Up til now, they all had one thing in common: layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments.  It was a pain.  Then I saw this one...with KNOBS! I did a lot of research, and was torn between the RP255 and the RP355. I decided to go cheap and got the RP255.  So far, that was an OK decision.  The RP255 has plenty of features, and is a good compromise between menus and knobs.  I recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation.To sum up the device quickly, the RP255 is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want, but you may need to work at it.  As with many multi-effect pedals, there is a selection of (60) factory tone/effect profiles, to save you the trouble of programming new ones.  These are mirrored by 60 ""user-defined"" profiles, which are identical to the factory presets.  The difference is that #1-60, can be modified by the user, or left as-is.  The factory presets, # 61-120, are not modifiable.  So, you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory.  You can also ""reset"" the entire device if you want to, but if you do you will lose all of your modifications.In addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer, there are also two additional features which are very useful: a (pretty basic)drum machine and a 20 second looper.  The looper is really why I bought this pedal.  It's easy to use, and it overdubs.  I only wish Digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper.  20 seconds really isn't much.  FYI, you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time.  No biggie for me.OK, all that's good, so why am I disappointed in this unit?  Pretty simple.  I'm an older guy, who has been playing for approximately 50 years.  I've played every kind of music there is, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets.  This may be a slight exageration, but it seems like 95% of the presets are some sort of (obnoxious) distortion.  Come on guys, not all of your customers are 13 years old!  I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices.  Now, I'm faced with working out all of my own presets.  I'm back to programming menus again, ugh!.So that's about it.  It's a solid piece of equipment, with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from.  In all honesty, if I had been aware of this, I would have probably not gotten this unit, inspite of its good design and quality."
1095,405,4.0,"For $120 you get virtually every effect in the book.ProsTuner works wellAbility to adjust presets on the computerClean sounds are great - especially the reverb. When spring reverb is used with the '65 Fender Twin amp model you can get a really great sounding drip, much better than you'd expect. Delay and chorus are also pretty good.Downloadable presets on the internetConsDistortions and overdrives are pretty meh. Nothing as good as even a DS-1 pedal. Nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive. And nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive.No permanent preset. In other words, it'd be great to have a clean channel that you could double tap to from any other preset. No dice, so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots. That makes what seems like a lot (60 slots) get filled up pretty fast.In the end, it's definitely worth the $120 I spent on it. I recommend this if you're in the market for one."
970,405,3.0,"So the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it.  I've used this in my jam lab for 4 years and use it every time I play electric (about 5-7 hours a week.)The unit itself has held up well.  No problems with case or pedals.  All switches, knobs, plugs, & display work fine.  It doesn't have a on/off switch but that's minor.  It's low profile and is easy to switch by foot.  I have it going into my mixer which works fine.  No feedback or buzz from it.I like the recording software, Cubase, that came with it.  I didn't think I'd use it much but I do.  It's fun and easy to record my own songs.  Cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close, but I've learned nothing happens and it's fine.I don't use the looper much as I have it before my Digitech Jam Man.  Which, if you don't have, you need it!  The drum presets are fun to use.  It's a blast to set a drum track, loop a rhythm, then jam on top of it.  Isn't that what it's all about?My two gripes are the tuner and clean presets.  The tuner is not very accurate and I use a cheapo tuner that works much better.  Also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn't.  Some flaw I guess.  Also the clean presets; like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak.  I don't like them at all.  The distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone.  They rock.  I use alot of the other ones as well.IMHO this the ""must have"" addition to your set up.  It's not for professional use...but when I turn pro I'll get something better."
708,405,1.0,"I gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it's hard to read because the lettering is so small. Also there are  many function for one knob to have, a little confusion for me. The sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice, but not something that is best for my needs.I am looking into a Boss ME-25 instead,"
526,405,4.0,"Any product that can make an intermediate-level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment. The RP255 is an amazing processor loaded with features (looper, drum machine, tuner) and dozens of cool pre-sets (""Greasr"" is my favorite). You can customize your own sounds but I still haven't gotten tired of Digitech's choices. The AC adaptor (included) allows for hours of rockin' fun. I live in a condo, so the headphone jack is essential. I run my iPod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes - sweet! The control settings can be a little daunting at first, but the owner's manual will walk you through the tough stuff. Bottom line: a great toy."

Now I will be checking all of them for sure.Not a good start though.Glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on.I suggest everyone check their monorpice cables. The testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of."
308,33,4.0,I use this cable to run from the balanced XLR outs on my digital piano to the balanced TRS inputs of my audio interface.  It works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it.  I am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone.

672,685,2.0,"This stand, after I finally figured out how to attach it so that it didn't interfere with the boom on my mic stand, works okay.  Due to its heaviness, it does hold a good size amount of music;  however, it is short, width-wise, so you can't really get an open notebook to stay in place.  (at least not with the ,mic boom there).  Heavy to travel with also, so I don't know how much I'll use it."
1209,685,4.0,"The question was, &#34;Did it meet your expectations?&#34; and it certainly did.  It is heavy duty but also light.  Well, placed on a light duty cheapo stand it might be a little heavy but and basic quality stand will handle it no problem.  It really seems well engineered and made of quality material."

633,685,3.0,I bought this stand after trying two others that didn't work well. This one is very adjustable and stays put. I use this in my home studio and I can place it so it comes up right under my mic boom just off to the side of microphone so when you are doing a vocal you don't have to look down or move you head away from the mic. I'll be buying two more.

436,130,4.0,"This gig bag was just what I needed to carry around a soprano ukelele. It has a strap for slinging the instrument over your shoulder when in the gig bag, padding, and a pocket in the front for your tuner.  The zipper is strong enough and it was just what I needed to carry around the ukelele to keep it protected while in transit."
612,130,4.0,"This gig bag is well worth the price.  It replaced the cheesy gig back I received with my soprano ukulele, and I have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now.  It has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up, and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends.  Get this gig bag!"
1419,130,4.0,"If you are looking for a good quality inexpensive case, this is a very good choice.  It has a durable feel to it. It has a handle and a removable strap as well as a zippered slot on the outside for accessories.  It works very well."
802,130,4.0,"Great bag, well padded the shoulder strap is nice! perfect! and very good price!What you would come to expect from lanikai!"
826,130,4.0,This is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right.  I like to ride my bike and take my uke along. The small size means it fits my panniers just fine.  The thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes.  The larger foam/nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don't fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well.  Highly recommended for the adventurous uke player.
1081,618,4.0,"I use 2 to stereo mic my egnater, works great, nice sound, to my ears not much different from an SM-57 and is a fraction of the price. It's not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me! Too noisy for hand held vocals, put it a mic stand instead."
254,618,4.0,Works as well as my friend's condenser mic that cost him three times as much. Great mic for the price.
778,618,4.0,"I've used both the ES-57 and ES-58 for several years now. They are a fantastic mic, great quality and construction. I love how hefty they are. I've got 6 of these and plan to buy more when needed. I would probably suggest a higher end if you were studio recording but I set up for live sound in and outdoors and these work great. I have several brands (some more expensive) but I always come back to GLS."
1372,618,4.0,This is the equivalent to the Shure SM-57 except for a quarter of the price. The quality is almost the same and in terms of recording they are pretty much the same as well. There allow a more natural sound than the SM57 I believe and are thus a better product!
812,618,4.0,"I had read many reviews on SM57 clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job. It seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone. The GLS ES57. (Same with the SM 58/ES58). I had to give it a shot. I run the sound for local bands and I use SM's because they can take abuse and still sound great. Only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far I really like it. The frequency band is not identical to the SM57 as some others have said. A little less bass but that doesn't mean it is a thin sound - it certainly is not. I can get it to sound the same as the SM if I EQ it slightly but I like the natural sound anyway. Also, the signal is a bit hotter but I really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments. Value for money it can't be beat. If you are on a budget, get one...."

797,618,4.0,"I bought this to replace my Blue Snowball because I've reached that point where I require something that sounds a little bit more professional than what I was using. Before I begin my review, I'd like to mention that I use this with a Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer with XENYX Preamp (copy and paste that into Amazon's search to find it). So my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing.Okay, my pros and cons.Pros1. My voice sounds great with this thing. Before I was using a Snowball and my podcast partner told me it sounded like I was in a &#34;chamber&#34;. With this, my voice is strong and clear...and even a little bassy which is nice because I don't have a naturally bassy voice. I'm extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound. It is WORLDS better than USB mics like the Blue Snowball. Worlds better.2. It's heft, heavy, and feels well made. This might be the most expensive-feeling device I own. It's heavy but it in a good way. The materials feel high quality. This feels like a professional microphone.3. It comes with a mic stand holder thing. Never say no to free stuff.Cons1. The only thing I can think of is that it doesn't come with its own cable. You'll need to buy an XLR cable on your own. It's not bad enough to deduct a star.There are people who are comparing this to the Shure SM57 and other microphones. Here's the thing, I am an amateur. Before I owned this mic, I was using a Blue Snowball and before that, my laptop webcam mic. So I am not the authority. All I can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing. My podcast co-host immediately noticed the difference and couldn't tell me enough of how much better I sounded and that's over a Skype call (we podcast using Skype). So if you're looking for a vocal/podcast mic, this is a great, cheap option. Are there better options? Sure, but not for this price. Not even close. Recommended wholeheartedly."
423,618,4.0,"I expected this Shure SM57 knock-off to disappoint me. I was not. For 30 bucks this thing does the job. There is a bit of handling noise but not enough to complain about. I put a windscreen on it to eliminate pops and wind noise. I recommend this mic for vocals. I've had fun with it. As far as longevity and durability, time will tell."
394,618,4.0,I own a GLS ES-58 and am very happy with it so when I need a mic for my guitar cab I went with a GLS-57 and couldn't be happier. These mics are very solid and I can't tell them from the real deal. I have done side by side comparison of both the real 57 and knock off 57 mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak I doubt you would notice any difference. I am about to purchase three more of these 57 mics for the rest of the bands intruments.
1420,618,4.0,"Loved this Mic when I hooked it up, it sounds great and for the price you can't go wrong.  Wish that it had a on/off switch but you can get around that.  Great for instruments and vocals as well.  Was delivered on time as well, amazon is the best and have the best vendor."
1050,618,4.0,"I've been using Shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and I can honestly say that I can hear no audible differences between a genuine Shure SM-57 and this GLS Audio ES-57.This isn't based on any scientific data, it's based on A/B'ing this mic and a Shure 57 on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre. I made sure that I marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amp's speaker grill. I recorded about 30 seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the Shure mic, and then this one. When you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good Bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two. If you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor I'm sure you'll see some visual differences (but they are also two different performances), but my ears really hear nothing audibly different. Some may disagree, but I'm convinced.This mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the Shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and out.Is it as good as the Shure? I don't know, I think so - others may not. I do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one Shure 57 though. I'd highly recommend these on guitar cabinets, snare drums, and toms for sure, maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voice.A no-brainer as far as I can tell."
1159,618,4.0,"This is a great value! I was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this. It doesn't sound exactly like an sm57, but it will get you close. You can EG your amp to compensate for the difference."
374,618,4.0,This Mike is an awesome value you could pay twice or three times more and the frequency response is excellent service was super fast I would've no problem buying from these folks again in the future
1293,484,4.0,"Very accurate. When I wanted a G I got a G.  I have such a refined ear, that I only have this around if I have a head cold, or you know, don't want to show off, but it's a good tuner."
967,484,4.0,It fits well on my Les Paul and Strat.  Does Not fly off the head when playing.  It's very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting.  The light works really well and that was what I was looking for.  As far as accuracy it's right on in either setting.
6,879,4.0,"I bought this for a friend who always wanted to play violin but never could afford one, the quality was surprisingly good considering how cheap it was, I helped her set it up (took 15 minutes max, just needed to get the bridge just right) and the only flaw I found was the horrible pegs that came with it, I had some spare rosewood ones in a drawer which fixed that small problem, as for the rest of the violin the furniture was workmanlike, not concert quality but serviceable for a student, the body was what really surprised me, for a mass produced student model it has a nice sound, I do believe that with nicer furniture, a better bridge, and strings I would not be ashamed to play this at a venue, how it will hold up over time is a open question but from what I can see of its internals it is well put together.this brings me to my only real problem, as she never has played any instrument at all she makes this violin squeal like a pig, I am no good at teaching so I got her a few books and downloaded some vids from youtube for her to watch but still...Her husband has forbidden her to bring the violin home till she can play so she comes over here to practice, which has led my neighbors to believe I am responsible for the sudden disappearance of several neighborhood cats (I think the noise chased em away) I am waiting for the call from the SPCA as I type this."
512,879,3.0,"The two violins we ordered came on time, and were packaged very well. All pieces that were advertised were included. The items appear as pictured. It is hard for me to rate this purchase, as I am still trying to get it in tune. I am using a snark clip on tuner, and have yet to get the strings in tune. We purchased peg drops to help with the tuning, but still have been unsuccessful in bringing them into tune."
960,879,3.0,"i mean if you just want something to learn the violin on then this is pretty good, stays in tune and is reinforced in all the weak spots because cracks will form"
125,879,3.0,"I bought this just to see if I might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (I'm gettin' old...lol)would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice.  I wouldn't say it's agreat instrument but WAY more than I expected for $60.  After I changed the strings,(I used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound.  I bought anew bow (for &#62;$100, so...) and found I like the one that came with it at least as much.The case is excellent...I'll prob use it with my upgrade.So for the price, you really get far more than you pay for.p.s.- the shoulder rest is kinda useless though."
1045,879,3.0,"This violin is AMAZING considering it's price, I got it for my girlfriend, expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn't she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked. I am a satisfied costumer, for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it, this one's for you.Basic but sturdy, gets the job done :)"
998,879,3.0,Sounds decent and stays in tune.  For the price this is just what you need if you want to dabble in/on the violin.
583,771,4.0,"run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer. windows 7 didnt need to install any drivers,it was plug n play. reaper picks it up immediately, just arm the track, set level and record. I will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca 222 into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting. I found that others had the same issue. I had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer, click ""recording devices"", select my uca222 (not internal microphone) from the list,click ""properties"" at the bottom of the Sound window, select the ""levels"" tab and reduce the level to around 2 or 3 to have an equal volume from themixer into windows 7 and Reaper. Until i did that, every signal into Reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothing.I tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problem.So far the behringer uca 222 is working great. and signal is clean."
587,771,2.0,"This interface is alright, nothing special, its for a guy on a budget. You can use it to record your old tapes or records and it will go straight through the interface to your computer via USB. There is pretty much little to no latency and it isn't noticeable. I plan on buying a tascam interface soon for around $70.00 and that should make things better for me. I will still use this to record anything on TV or like I said, old tapes. The software bundle is pretty much free, as you can find everything on the internet, they just bundled it together for you, which is nice."
508,771,1.0,"i only bought with the idea that a ""FULL"" version of behringer's sequence program came with it....needless to says its a ""compact version"" and for you OTHER iMac/OS X Users out there????----aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on Vst's Au's that will WORK with OSX and Cubase or garageband....other than that its another interface ""i guess"" as long as you want to use RCA plugs to do that with...who the !$%^ uses RCA to interface there analog instruments to their puter????based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a PC/Windows owner I would GET IT!!!!its about the cheapest way to ""intro"" yer way in to DAW/DAT interface..... Mainly im talkning to Katz who ownnewer Macs/iMacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and Keyboard sequencingfor THOSE users yer better off buying a pizza probably..."
794,771,2.0,Pros:- Price point- Does the job in the descriptionCons:- Shielding of USB cable is abysmal; very susceptible to interference (could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it)- Cheap plastic construction
564,771,4.0,This device is a converter that works with RCA inputs and outputs.  The Input seems to be geared for the -10DB range for consumer level audio range.  This box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones.
1188,771,3.0,I'll be brief and to the point here:+ Works as an audio interface for a line level signal. I used this with my Samson mixer.+ Is compact and the USB cable itself is long enough.+ The red color looks nice.+ Has a headphone out with volume control+ Plug and play. No extra drivers needed. I use ASIO anyways.+ Cheap. There's NO audio interface this affordable.+ Latency fairly low. Not bad.- Plastic body- RCA connectors. Not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono(1/4 inch).- 44.1 khz and 16 bit sampling. Should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz. Even my DigiTech RP255 has a built in 24bit audio interface.
764,771,4.0,"I previously had the UCA-202 and it worked great for me for a couple of years but I noticed the audio went dead in one of the RCA phono input jacks (I had used those jacks previously with no issues). Regardless, I liked the UCA-202 so much that I got the UCA222 to replace it without hesitation, plus as a bonus, it's purdier! :)  Plugged it in just now, fired up the PC, the new UCA222 started working immediately...no muss, no fuss!  For the money, I don't think you can find a better deal for enhancing your PC's audio versatility.  I don't know if I'll even bother with the included software as I use a great program called Mixcraft (btw, check that out if you're looking for PC recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other, costlier guys). Anyway, two thumbs way up for the UCA222!"
633,771,4.0,"I own three of these units (one Red 222 and two Grey 202)and use them to output midi sounds from my laptops internal sound moduals to a pro PA system (mostly Mackie gear) for live performance and occasionally to add sounds to recordings in my 24 track home studio. This unit is quiet and very handy. The price is dead cheap. I have two other similar units (a Lexicon Alpha and the smaller Lexicon Omega boxes)that cost much more. Yes my Lexicon boxes provide a lot of different inputs and outputs and are very nice but if all you need is a very portable basic input/output sound card that is very quiet and easy to install (just plug it), you should buy this box.Some of the reviews talk about it being ""cheap"" plastic. Yes it is plastic (so are many other more expensive units) but I have been throwing these boxes in with my other equipment and have yet to break one of them or have any problems. I will also admit that while I don't abuse my equipment on purpose, I am not that gentle either and have dropped these several times with no damage.The software that comes with the 222 package is good, but in my case I really didn't need it. I have Sonor/Cakewalk software and Abobe Audition but I would like to take a moment and say something about the included Audacity. One reviewer wrote that it is a ""very low,low.low"" quality software. That couldn't be further from the truth. I have used this software for years in my studio and it is very high quality software. It can work in both 16 and 24 bit processing, and input and output almost every type of audio format (.wav, MP3, etc.). It also has a ton of very nice free downloads (compressors, EQ's, sonic enhancers etc.)from the Audacity web site. Audacity started life as a shareware but was purchased by Sound Forge who was in turn bought by Sony. This is high quality studio software that you can still download and use for free and it's not a trial software that will expire in 30 days or block out important features. I would add that to really make it work well you need to use the preferences section to set it up to the higher quality settings that are available. As I remember the defaults are set at mid level quality so the average home user can use it without taxing their computer resources.The bottom line is that both Behringer units (202 and 222) both work great and I can't hear or see any difference in them other than the color and the added software included with the 222 package. For such a low price you can't go wrong."
166,897,4.0,"I just needed this for my new guitar. From the looks of it, it complements the instrument well. I am happy with it."
1028,897,4.0,"I used these on my ukuleles, and they worked well enough that I bought tow more pairs.  They hold a regular strap well, and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a Uke Leash (google it, those are fabulous!).cheers."
31,897,4.0,This is one of those products which is easier to find and purchase online than trying to shop.  Its performance is min/max the same.  I've used three with no trouble.  You can get excellent instructions and tips on YouTube.
222,897,3.0,"Arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar... very easy to install, but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument."
103,897,4.0,"if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you,  I was hesitant at first, but this did the job."
921,897,4.0,Easy to install these buttons on the guitar.  Well made and just what I was looking for.  Thank you very much.
586,785,4.0,"Fender original parts can't be beat. The Philips head is an improvement over the &#34;vintage&#34; straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish. These look like the have a nickel plating and I believe are 8-18, or 6-18 size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store, but I chose Fender original parts for the Tele I recently finished and for the one I am currently working on."
956,785,3.0,"These are as described - these work with fender switches (which, turns out they include those screws), and fender pickups. Used them while building a few pre-wired pick guards."
651,785,4.0,They work and are fender parts. Even thoigh they work on many brands. Use them on all makes and no complaints todate.
753,785,1.0,I have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body . I had to trim them down
1270,785,3.0,I probably could have found the same screw at the hardware store but these are OEM and fit perfectly. Recommended.
1265,785,4.0,"These work just fine as replacement mounting screws for  single-coil pickups mounted to a pickguard, though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker (nothing that a little drilling out couldn't fix, if you're so inclined)."
1210,706,2.0,This processor is okay for home practice if you need something other than just a dry signal. The sound is a little too electronic for me. I bought an RP-1 and it sounds much better.
1291,706,3.0,"This little unit is packed with great effects. For $50, I'm very impressed. Has just about everything you need in a entry-level pedal, except for a pedal control!!"
1100,706,2.0,"I like the drum machine and the tuner, but I don't like the effects, I don't have an electric guitar, I only have acoustic electric guitars, and I thought that maybe I could make it sound like an electric, but the sounds are distorted, and not very clean, it sound muff.For an electric guitar maybe it would work fine, but not for an acoustic electric guitar."
803,706,0.0,"These types of pedals are toys. They are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with. By all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing. If not, i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay, or distortion."
609,706,4.0,Works well and has good sound. I really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds. The interface could be easier to use but for this price point one can't really complain.
1035,706,0.0,"I had a friend with one of these and he loves it. I got one on his recommendation and when I put the batteries in it, it started smoking. It did work for awhile. I pulled the batteries out and tried to AC adapter and it smoked again, this time it did not work. I am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work, holds a grudge. I would not advise anybody to get this."
266,706,1.0,"This particular brand I've seen around and haven't heard to much about them, but the one that I got worked fine for about a couple days. It went out and I sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that I MIGHT have gotten a bad one.And I requested in a letter when I sent it in that they send another one in exchange, That didn't work out so well, with that being the only way I COULD RATE it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one, I'd have to rate this one at the bottom..."
829,540,3.0,"works well for acoustics, as well as electrics,  I have amazon prime so I got it quick. well made and folds easily"
62,540,3.0,"Great Price, easy to transport and set up and it holds my guitar.  It does what it is designed for.  Can't ask for more!"
369,540,4.0,"Can't beat these $10 stands! They are a bit troublesome to open and collapse, the snap buttons are hard to depress. But once open they stand up well. Since I don't travel much they are great if you use your guitar in a studio and don't travel around much."
477,540,4.0,Love these guitar stands! Sturdy and compact and at such a reasonable price. You will pay up to 4x more for similar stands! Great bargain.
1098,540,3.0,This is a quality stand. I use it for my Yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great. Nothing but praise for this item.
595,540,4.0,"Small yet sturdy enough to hold a full-size guitar.  Nothing to put together, just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms.  A very good price for an excellent product."
26,540,4.0,"Item arrived on time and as described, item is solid and well designed. does not need and installation and setup, this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars. I ll buy more for the other guitars at my house."
35,540,4.0,"This is my favorite acoustic guitar stand. It's easy to use on stage, it can be used with only one hand, and it has a low profile that doesn't take up a lot of space when folded, and it doesn't stick out as an eyesore on stage. I use this thing constantly, and can wholeheartedly recommend it."
627,540,4.0,"I already have one of these stands for one of my guitars and recently bought the tubular type...I should have bought another one of these instead. As someone else mentioned here, this stand does not put any unnecessary pressure on the guitar and the space needed on the floor is minimal and the guitar can be displayed near a wall. I highly recommend this guitar stand.----5 stars."
1214,540,4.0,it's a guitar stand that holds your guitar so it don't fall down during a gig hurting potential fans and thier friends....well constructed....awesome price.
1362,540,4.0,"For the price and free shipping, this can't be beat. It's heavy weight, solid construction, and very stable. Pay attention to the warnings. If your guitar has polypropylene finish, which most do, you're going to be fine. If you have a very high end guitar, this might not work."
309,540,4.0,this holds guitars very well.  it is quality.  I wish it was made in America.  I gave it to my church
1199,896,4.0,Should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link.
252,896,4.0,"I needed this balanced cable to connect a clip-on mic pickup for my acoustic guitar.It works perfectly and my recording are rich and full.Great price, too!"
1425,896,4.0,"My studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs.  I purchased several of these cables at varying lengths and found them quite acceptable for this application.  I'm not sure I'd put them in my remote recording kit--they're not really heavy duty.  But for speakers or other static applications, they're just fine."
141,896,4.0,Noise free cables with good connectors at an affordable price.I used them for acoustic drum microphones into a mixer without any problems.
170,576,1.0,should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day...these have been ordered for a couple of weeks...you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks...i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day...hope they work when they do finally arrive..good luck
412,576,4.0,"This is a really strong capo.  The spring is very robust.  Well padded, and will not damage your instrument.  I have used it on guitars (electric and acoustic), banjo, and mandolin.  Takes some hand strength to open it, but you don't want a weak capo!"
594,576,2.0,"Very pleased with timely arrival of the package.  Excited to use it with my new guitar, but after only two days of actual use it broke.  The plastic tension section just snapped off.  Very disappointed!"
791,576,3.0,"I just got it today. Really tight because it's brand new, but it's really sturdy and solid. Nothing gimmicky or faulty, just perfect."
562,576,2.0,You have to get this cap on JUST right or the strings will buzz.  I think I'll keep this as a backup and get a better one for my every day use.
1207,576,4.0,"If you're in the need for a guitar capo, then this is a pretty good offering. For it being pretty cheap, I had to get it. Shipping was fairly fast, and it's ready to use straight out of the package. :D"
162,576,4.0,"It really has everything that one could ask for in a guitar capo - it's a quality well-made tool that isn't going to fall apart any time soon; it has a strong spring, so it grips the neck and strings quite solidly; and it's easy to open up and clamp on the neck.Can't really say anything more than that this really is a well-made capo that works just exactly and precisely as a capo is supposed to work.I love it!"
1095,576,2.0,"This capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck, for example a les paul or most acoustics. For thinner necks, like a strat or tele, it works ok, but has to be positioned just right to prevent string buzz. It's not the ole clip it and go capo I'm used to. I bought this to have a capo I could just leave clipped on my acoustic's head for use when needed. No dice. Neck too thick. It's a Washburn dreadnaught. We're not talking some funky 7 string jazz guitar.Bottom line: It's cheap as dirt and you can make it work if you don't mind having to place it just right. My advice, spend a few bucks more and buy one that's easy."
326,576,2.0,"It does the job. The only problem is that it sticks out a little to far down underneath the guitar neck thus impeding the fingers from taking the right position for some of the chords. You slide it up and away, you might loose pressure on strings and your guitar will make funny noises especially if you use hard strings. For the money, it does the job ok. It's a good one for beginers like myself."
862,576,4.0,"This Capo does what it needs to do, makes it sound great, and is a great price. There are times where the capo is a little big and the fingers can hit it but in general, it is probably the best capo there is for an acoustic guitar. It does not break, and is very sturdy. Highly recommended."
470,576,4.0,I was skeptical because of the price but these work great.  It is even large enough to use with my 12 String.
112,576,2.0,"This capo will do the job, if you can squeeze it open.  I'm hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension. it is all I can do to open and place this on the guitar.  I cannot do it with one hand."
482,576,4.0,"As soon as put it on my guitar, I enjoyed the way it got the job done. My first concern was, Will this damage my guitar? The answer is NO. It is user friendly and guitar friendly. The price is so low, you should own at least one. No problems. Just music. At the most competitive price available."
26,576,4.0,"This capo works fine, its strong and fits great on my Spanish or Steel string guitar, I wouldn't ask for something more"
1206,576,4.0,"I received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar. It is styled very much like the Kyser capos but cost about one third of what you'd pay for a Kyser. It is made of aluminum, NOT ABS plastic as another reviewer suggested. The spring is plenty strong enough to hold down all 6 strings with no problems. The rubber pad is flat and this capo works well on guitars with a flat fret board. I don't know how well it would work on a guitar with a curved radius fret board. I'm thinking it may not hold the high and low ""E"" strings down sufficiently to keep them from buzzing. I could be wrong. Keep in mind it is very important to fully depress the spring when moving the capo up or down the neck. Sliding it will cause wear on the rubber pad on any capo. The wound strings will cut into the rubber  like a file if you slide it on the strings. I really haven't had it long enough to see if it will stand the test of time, but as the title of my review reads: ""So far, So good"" It's very reasonably priced and I'm very pleased with it. I rate it at 5 stars. It's well worth the money. It's very unlikely to break and if I find the rubber pad wears out prematurely, I will update my review."
65,576,4.0,"As I am one of those ""forever beginners"" when it comes to playing a guitar I may not be able to tell you all that this capo does. The reason I ordered it is to hold my strings so I can set my guitar. I may play around with it to see what all it does.Good price, just as described!"
292,576,4.0,Capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration.
1293,576,2.0,Capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary.  This one has a very strong spring so I am hoping i lossens up with use.
1239,576,4.0,Came on time. Works Very good. Strong spring that good start. If needed I would buy another. For me and my son it works great.
724,576,4.0,I got this as it has a little different clamp handle design than another I bought earlier.  Like the black and it holds well.  This has been appropriated by my son who really likes it on his black guitar.  No problem as I bought one as a spare against emergency breakage.
182,576,4.0,"I chose this capo because I was just starting out and needed one for certain songs. This was a cheap capo, but it does its job well. I have no complaints about it at all."
605,576,4.0,"Great product. Great price. Buy it.As a pro musician my entire teenage and adult life, I say, ""Ya, good capo"""
1190,576,2.0,"good for any guitar even if it is plastic it feel really strong on your guitar neck, it is a really good buy"
499,576,4.0,"Some say ""this capo work bad"" I have to ask ""are your guitar is good enough to use this capo?"" or ""are you know how to use capo?""I'm more than 20 years of playing guitar. This capo is worth the price. Good quality and work great for not extream user (Are you nuts?). Best recomended quality and price. PS. May not for very big guitar neck! Enjoy!"
1215,576,4.0,"Easy to use does a great job and comes off when you want it to, and does not scratch or harm guitar in any way. Great price as well. I got two of them."
23,576,4.0,Does the trick! I use it all the time and haven't had any issues with functionality or build quality. I'd recommend it over more expensive capos any day! Good purchase.
336,518,4.0,Very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime.  Easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight.  Cannot go wrong with this one.
1072,518,4.0,This is a great stand.  In the past I have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made.  This one serves the bill.  I am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable.  It is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use.  I use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased.
932,518,4.0,The music stand is quite sturdy and well made in my humble opinion. I needed a music stand that could support a note book of music I have assembled over the years. This was great. I added a clip on LED light as well. PERFECT :-)
773,518,4.0,Strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job. The price was right. May buy another for a spare.
553,518,4.0,"I needed a good solid stand for my music while seated playing guitar.  solid- yes, adjusts to right height - YesIt is perfect! WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY."
544,518,4.0,I was looking for something more solid than the usual fold up stand and this is it.  I can put a heavy notebook full of music on it and a lamp and a tray and more stuff and it is rock solid.  Very happy.
225,518,4.0,This was so perfect that we bought 2 more of them for our music at home!
748,518,4.0,"nice wide lip, sturdy, appears to be well made and durable, nice finish on it, hopefully will last a long time"
865,518,4.0,"Assembled the stand in seconds. It is very stable and solidly constructed. Should last a life-time. Very, very good value."
489,876,1.0,"Sounds disgusting. Very bright and clear highs, nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows. Don't hope to take chords on it. Only on first 4 strings may be...Try out fender's mini amp if you're searching for a little thing, or but a bigger one."
345,876,4.0,"I bought this because I was going on a trip and needed an amp I could pack in my suitcase that would work with a battery.I had a similar amp before that died. The Honeytone is very compact, but looks cool and is very simple to operate, with just three controls, volume, tone and gain (distortion). I found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume. If you try playing clean, with no distortion, you'll be underpowered. The trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation. I tried a regular electric guitar, a lap steel guitar, a slide guitar, an acoustic-electric guitar, an acoustic-electric mandolin and a silent banjo. I thought the acoustic guitar would overwhelm this little amp, but I was surprised that it added to the projection and wasn't bad on the tone. It has a handy belt clip and a useless little leather handle (just for looks). I am using it to play an electric instrument in jamming situations where everyone else is playing acoustic, and I can adjust my volume to blend in. I think a mike with an unbalanced output (1/4&#34; phone jack) would also work in here, for street corner singing, for instance, though I haven't tried that yet as all my mikes use XLR jacks and there would be the issue of a mike stand or a lapel or headphone mike with a phone jack output, which might be hard to find.Overall, I'm very pleased with this amp and it seems sturdy and reliable so far, and at $20, a bargain."
906,876,2.0,"I bought this to go with my Epiphone ukulele, for both myself and my grandson.  It's a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp.  For the price, it's good."
657,876,4.0,"If you have an acoustic/electric uke, this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends, beach, road trip, camping, etc. It's quite small, and easy to pack into a backpack or bag. It's not a great electric amp, but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke. Use a 9-volt when you need it, or buy a 9v AC adapter to plug into an outlet. You can't find a better option on a budget, when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile-quality sound."
1062,876,4.0,"I was rather skeptical of this little box amp, but it works great.  My acoustic gets a pretty hefty electric sound with the tone and overdrive adjustments!  Not sure how long the 9V battery will last, but the advantage of such a small box, with such a sound is worth a couple of batteries.  I have been playing on and off for the past three hours and it is just fine!  Well worth the money spent!  And it is small enough to fit right into the pocket of my guitar bag...one less thing to tote!  Looks really cool too!"
1408,876,4.0,"I have to say this little guy packs a punch and for 20 bucks. I just needed something I could plug into that was super portable and cheap. Also this works well with an iPhone set up if you want to use some larger effects this little guy doesn't come with. Also this little guy doesn't gobble up 9volt batteries like other guitar gear tends to do. The only minor flaw is it's made out of plastic so if you need something more durable maybe get a solid state amp the plugs into a wall outlet....our buy two more of these, they are only 20 bucks."
1379,876,3.0,"i like it as the stars say...great for around the house playing,but  lately i noticed it does cut out on me...when you strum it shuts down somrtimes,i am not sure if it is the battery or it just does not like the song i am playing...when you turn it back on it usally works fine...some other people have made the same discovery also...but for $20...i'm going to live with it,,has a belt clip if you want to look really silly playing...i just glued it to my pelvis!!!"
729,876,3.0,"Fun little rig. Needed something to play electric through headphones, and this offered me that plus a mini amp when needed. The sound quality is surprisingly hot."
180,876,4.0,"This portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone. It's way louder than a 9volt Fender mini Twin (which actually does incorporate two speakers), however when you dial in the gain all the way you get a crunch rather than full on distortion. It comes included with a 9volt and is compatible with most negative tip power adapters (make sure its 300mA like the Planetwaves adapter for $9.00). At $20.00 this amp is a deal!"
555,876,4.0,"In my opinion...This is the best amp in this category. I know people who have the Marshall and the Fender. I plugged into my little HoneyTone and I had the best sounding micro amp hands down. They were both amazed with the sound. They said ""well mine was only $45 and ""mine was only $40."" Too bad so sad for them. I told them mine was $20. Since it doesn't say Marshall or Fender, I only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp. If you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts, and know what to expect from a micro, this amp does not disappoint"
55,876,4.0,"The HoneyTone is aptly named.  It has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size. That reputation is earned.  It has double the volume of a portable amp I own that's twice its size.  The tone range is generous (from mellow to high treble).  From what I've seen and heard, the &#34;overdrive&#34; function is fairly useless in an amp this size.  It tends to go distortion to the point of garble.  My guess is specific guitars may work well with the overdrive, but I have no use for it as I prefer clear tones.  It is possible to over-volume the amp (as with any amp) so i don't max it out, but for a portable or practice amp, it works very well.  I've bought three of these now and plan to buy more.  I don't know as I'd pay $40 to $60 for it, but the Amazon price (currently around $20) makes it a great value.  I hope it's around at this price level for a long time as it's great for hobbyist projects or for box guitar amping."
267,772,4.0,"Seem to work well. Keep the ground switch selected, and it will do just fine. I have used different direct boxes and I recommend this one."
251,772,2.0,"I thought I was getting something that would boost/amplify the signal from my bass to the amp.  It didn't, but at it's cheap price it wasn't bad and I found other uses for it.  They make ones that will boost the signal, so if that's what you're looking for, be a careful consumer."
1086,772,4.0,"I bought this because my band's primary PA mixer doesn't have high-impedance inputs for a guitar pickup, and I don't always want to bring my submixer for quick-change gigs. So, a small, cheap DI box seemed like a good solution.The PDC21 is a no-frills device. It converts a 1/4"" instrument cable (high Z) to a balanced/unbalanced 1/4"" or XLR (low Z) signal. It does a fine job. I don't notice it coloring the sound (i.e., it's not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted) although it does lower the volume somewhat. That's to be expected in a passive DI box, and it doesn't bother me.I'm using it with an LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup. The M1A spits out a fairly hot signal, and I don't have any problem with the signal loss associated with the PDC21. If I were using a passive pickup in my guitar, the results might be different.Bottom line: it's small, fairly light, seems durable, and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the XLR inputs our PA mixer requires. It does everything I wanted, and the price was right. I see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one."
564,772,4.0,"This passive DI-box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input.  Some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation.  The -20db attenuation sounded funny, but that is probably because I used the same equipment for all attenuation settings.  With each attenuation setting, I had to adjust the input volume accordingly.  This device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops.  All the devices that I tried this with did not have their own internal grounding, so I needed to have the ground come from the mixer.  I did get some hum when I would touch the case, just like I did with other DI-boxes.  This product worked very well for my needs."
1075,772,0.0,"A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted.  Works great in intervals though, too bad those intervals are minutes."
192,772,4.0,"I bought 4 pcs of these at $8each shipped. These are very well constructed and function very well too. I am using these to tap the INSERTS from my mixer and send the signal to my M-audio Fast Track ultra for recording. By putting the 1/4"" TS partially in to the INSERT of my mixer (and most mixers) you can get a direct output without actually interupting the signal chain. The other end of the 1/4"" TS cable goes to the PDC21 and then I use the XLR output to connect to my Fast Track using either and XLR to XLR or and XLR to TRS cable. My Fast Track did not like something about the signal level when I fed it directly from the mixer but with the PDC21 between the mixer and FTU, it works fantastic. This is for refernce recording in our jam-space, not studio recording; it works great for this application.I have also used this as a DI box for guitar, all of my gear is middle of the line (not junk but not super high-end), I don't notice any tone-sucking in my ""jam-space"" application.I would definately buy more."
1415,772,4.0,"Grabbed a handful of these units to bolster up my recording kit this year.  I got three single channels and two dual channel units.Set them up for the keyboard player (Dual Channel), bass, and guitar player DI's plus one from a DI output on a effects module that were all on stage and connected them into my snake running to the back of the venue.Crystal clear sound from all 4 units straight into a recording mixing console.  I was impressed.Not one pop, hiss, crack or anything from these units all night.  Even was able to adjust the pad setting on the guitar and bass to cut the signal a bit so I didn't have to use so much compression to keep the signal from clipping going to the recording.No telling how long these units will last, but for the price, who cares, just buy another one and move on.Check out how these boxes sound on the Band's YouTube page @ GerrellTheBand to hear the sound coming from these units.  Near studio quality."
244,772,3.0,"this box is what i have been missing out of my setup. always getting the question,&#34;Can i hook my keyboard into your sound board&#34;. Feel good to say that now I have the capability now"
66,772,4.0,Can't say much more than the description.  It's a cheap box that works.  Nothing fancy and not for everyone.  If you just need a box that is cheap this is it.
297,581,4.0,I've bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet.  They all work flawlessly.  I'll definitely buy more and highly recommend them.  Just like Schaller but Fender branded and cheaper (Asian made).
642,581,4.0,"As a new guitar player I have a lot to learn, and after nearly dropping my guitar twice in about 15 minutes because the strap sliding off the pegs research was needed.  Based on reviews here and other sites I ordered these.  Arrived quickly, extremely easy to install and work as advertised.  Would buy these again if/when I acquire new guitars."

440,581,0.0,"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."
233,581,4.0,If you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps. Easy to use and very secure. No fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor.
132,581,4.0,"There is a lot to think about with a strap lock... Is it 100% sturdy? 100% reliable? Does the design put undue stress or wear on the guitar? Can it fit in a case, or does it make you take the strap off every time you put your guitar away?The Fender-Schaller design covers all of these bases well. I believe it is 100% sturdy and reliable. Unlike it's Dunlop competition, the stress on the guitar is roughly equivalent to plain strap buttons. It will not fit in all cases, but will fit in many.I've switched over to this design and couldn't be happier with it.NOTE: I advise using a crescent wrench and a socket to tighten the nut. One always wants to avoid over-tightening, but the risk of under-tightening is high without proper leverage. If you don't really tighten the nut down, you are likely to have things fall apart while playing some day."
1226,581,4.0,"This straplock set doesn't come with any instructions, that's because it's so easy you don't need them! Took the original screws off my Fender Strat, set the button, screws and felt washer together and quickly screwed it in. Afterwards screwed the lock into myGibson Lightning Bolt Style 2 Inch Safety Guitar Strap, Jet Blackwithout any problem whatsoever and it was ready!It is a quite simple mechanism but it shows that the button and lock won't come loose by accident by any chance. Still haven't given it a real gig test but by hanging it for a couple minutes I can tell I made the right purchase. Way recommended!"
1031,581,4.0,This is a very good strap lock system. i put it on my wolfgang guitar and it locked very properly my strap. recommended.
1103,581,4.0,"This was a filler item for a much larger order.  I am very interested in the Straplocks, so I decided to give them a try.  I sincerely like the concept."
547,581,4.0,"Easy to install, I used the guitars existing strap button screws.Straplocks came with black & white felt, that's a nice touch. I think black looks better with my guitar."
1018,581,4.0,"Look just like Schaler branded parts without the Schaler brand name stamped on them - there is a little Fender logo on the bottom - real cool.These strap locks are the greatest - they work perfectly every time and will survive years of on the road abuse. I have carried an extra set with me in my case in the event that I broke one - but this has never happened.Touring, bar bands, garage bands or bedroom heroes all need these strap locks on every guitar and strap they own. And since the guitar isn't hanging by the hole in the strap the strap lasts years longer."
1269,101,4.0,"This Behringer box is a very good tool, effect I would recommend to anyone from beginner to pro. One thing should be noted the light is amber not blue and no 9 volt battery is required. The device comes with a removable power cord, which  to me is a big plus."
1303,101,3.0,"When you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply.  There is no need to purchase a separate Behringer PSU-SB.Otherwise the time machine works fine, as described."
1360,101,4.0,I really like this delay. It's simple and works well. I really am starting to love Behringer. Great pedal for a great price.
455,101,4.0,This is an awesome analog echo effect. Very similar to a EHX Memory Man it does it all. The only complaint is the pots have limited function unlike the MM so instead of a lot of play on some of the knobs you have a very little bit of play which can be annoying. Other than that for the price its just awesome.
472,412,3.0,"Other reviews give an adequate overview of the kit and its potential so I'll just mention particular details: The kick pedal spring tension was set too tight, making the pedal hard to control and very frustrating to a beginner. Fortunately the thumbscrew and nut adjustment is easy and made a tremendous improvement in feel and control.The documentation is poor and, inexcusably, there's nothing better available online from Alesis: The steps in the graphical setup page are less than ideal for a single person assembly. The kit allows for tremendous flexibility in positioning the pads horizontally and vertically, yet you're pretty much left on your own to discover this. Experienced drummers will know what they want but I would have appreciated a suggested basic setup showing common variations.The control module's buttons and operation are described but there's no detailed guide to the preset kits or selectable pad patches. You'll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes.There seems to be an ongoing controversy over a firmware update to the controller module - whether it fixes an issue with the snare drum pad responsiveness when struck simultaneously with the hi hat, or is in fact the cause of an issue with the pad. I've noticed no such problem and, as of this date, Alesis has no such update on their site, which leads me to suspect their former patch may have been bad and/or they've updated units currently being sold.Speaking of the snare, the second outer zone for rimshots is nice but I can only get it to trigger while sticking from the outside. The technique of laying the stick flat across the head and lifting one end doesn't seem to trigger the rimshot (or perhaps I just haven't worked out the touch yet).I'm interested in a natural sound, probably close to a classic jazz kit, and a couple of the presets work for me. I also have Battery 3 and using the kit to trigger those samples opens up vast possibilities. Still, most of the time I just want to sit down and play and don't want to bother firing up the PC and loading software so it's nice to have two workable options. The headphone volume could be louder but running it into powered speakers and taking a headphone out from them solves that issue.Keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lint-free cloths. Dampen one with a little warm water (wring it out well) and use a light circular motion to remove dust and dirt, then wipe gently with the dry cloth to take up any residue.This is my first experience with an electronic kit and, as others have mentioned, the sensation really is fundamentally different from an acoustic instrument, particularly when striking the cymbal pads. It takes awhile to mentally balance the soft thud or click (depending on which surface you strike) from outside the headphones with the sampled drum sound within. I wasn't sure I liked it for the first couple of weeks (meaning I probably didn't) but I've gotten used to it and have gradually begun to relate to the DM6 on its own terms, not as an imitation of an acoustic drum kit, but as something else with its own special characteristics."
522,412,3.0,"For the money it costs it worth it. The construction seems good (especially the kick drum pedal), but the brains leave a little to be desired, although it's very functional. The biggest complaint I have is that it only has 1/8&#34; stereo out and 1/8&#34; headphones out. Really should be 1/4&#34; mono or stereo. I bought a separate plug to allow this so I could put it into my mixer and I'm good."
80,412,2.0,"I'll try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said. Setup was fairly easy (although the instructions were downright cryptic). The adjustability is wonderful. And the kit looks phenomenal out of the box. That being said, one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them (I'll soon contact the company for a replacement), the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement (you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard, and even then it's no guarantee), and I'm guessing, due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads, the snare often activates when I strike the hi-hat. At first glance, the different tone kits don't bring much to the table. But there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls. To a small extent, I've even been able to cover up the less-than-responsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces. My only other complaint is that the bass drum doesn't bring much to the table. It sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal.In short; this kit was somewhat defective out of the box. But it's still fun to use. So, unless you plan to record with your electronic kit, I'd recommend this product as a fun musical toy. But it's certainly not up to par with some of the more expensive kits I've used. And recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare."
513,412,3.0,"I am a beginner and wanted a set that I can learn on, but would also allow me to experiment with other percussion instruments besides a rock drum set and would take a small amount of room and allow low volume levels.  I've had this set for about a month and a half.  So far, it is working well for me.  The rubber drum and cymbal surfaces are great for keeping the volume low enough when playing late at night.  Each drum and cymbal seem to have sweet spots where I imaging the triggers are.  Depending on the devise, hitting further from this sweet spot might change the sound and/or volume produced.  The impression I get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another, so it seems to be whether the problem(s) are something you can live with or not.  Also, you can't play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set, but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that I can enjoy it and feel like I'm learning the drums.  It takes up very little space compared to an acoustic set which is great for me since I have little room for it.  There are a few problems that I'm not likely to encounter until I become really accomplished.  One is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hi-hat or tom 1 simultaneously, one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about half the time.  I found this out when playing these combinations rapidly, which I'm not likely to do maybe ever.  But it is still an error in functionality.  I called Alesis and they said this was a common characteristic of this model drum set.  There is a firmware update that has been mentioned in earlier reviews that I, but it didn't make any difference.  In summary, for the price and my needs, I am very pleased with this drum set.  More expensive sets with more sounds and better nuance control don't have the rubber surfaces that I want, plus, according to reviews they all seem to have problems of some type so spending more money doesn't necessarily eliminate problems."
1381,235,4.0,"I agree with those reviewers who really like this pickup. It has a very natural sound, is reliable and amazingly strong. The suction cup issue is easy to solve, it just needs to be a bit humid and it will stay well. I also bought (for comparison) the Cherub WCP-60G, which is not bad but has much more of an unnatural metallic sound, plus it seems more feedback-prone than the AXL. I can only recommend, if you have a nice classical guitar and want to amplify it with true sound, the AXL is an excellent and inexpensive solution. I doubt that the $200 stuff is much better."
373,235,3.0,"Got it right b4 x'mas, thanks Amazon!It is one of the best value I have purchased.  Suction design is great for any size of string instruments, uke, small soundholded guitars, or acoustic guitars. Thanks for the previous viewers' tip to moisture the suction b4 pressuring on the surface of the guitar that next to the bridge.  It stays great and pickups perfectly without any unwanted noise from the pickup wire itself (recently have bought another one does).  great value and quality for $11 i spent ever."
1223,235,3.0,I bought this for a friend who plays the guitar. He said that you can hear the guitar but barely.
15,235,1.0,"It does not stick on to the guitar very well.  Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin.  I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet, bought a better pickup."
940,235,3.0,Works really well with all of my stringed acoustic instruments It has a good clean sound and I think for the price you can not go wrong.
509,235,1.0,"the suction cup does not work. it looks like aged. it's very hard with room temp 70F. I removed the rubber suction cup and I have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge. it picks up sound OK, but not great."
1257,277,4.0,"I bought this to try out on my baritone uke.It works great and is very easy to use.I use it with my Fender Mustang.I had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my Martin DX1.I was able to attach it to the smoother HPL back and sides using the suction cup.I wet it before attaching.You could also use a small clamp, blue painters tape, etc., for trouble mounting.It could be used on just about any instrument.  Some may need a clamp.It picks up anything it is attached to.It will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp.Pretty cool.Nice price."
436,277,4.0,"I bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles I own.The first ukelele was a Lanakai LU-21.  It installed pretty easily, except the adhesive lost its adhesion after I moved the pickup to a new location within the soundbox.  I need to get some stronger carpet tape or new adhesive to secure it more permanently in its new location.  It sounded great though -- several people commented on how loud and sweet the instrument sounded through a guitar amplifer and also through a mixer, amp and PA system.  We did have to boost the gain on the mixer significantly to get adequate volume, but we were able to project enough sound to do a dance for about 100 people.  Straight into a guitar amp, it gave plenty of volume.Happy with the results, I then installed a second one in a Mahalo painted/economy ukelele available here on Amazon.  The installation went well except the endpin jack wouldn't ""stay put"" in the sound hole.  On my Lanakai this was not a problem -- there is a ragged washer which goes on the inside of the endpin jack which is supposed to bite into the wood on the inside of the instrument.  It is supposed to stop the endpin jack from turning when you screw on a strap pin/bolt onto the endpin jack from the outside of the instrument.  On the Lanakai, this ragged-edged washer bit into the softer mahogany-like wood easily and did its job very well.  On the Mahalo, which is a smooth maple or pine, the ragged washer couldn't bite into the wood.  As a result, the endpin jack turned and turned when I tried to screw on the outer bolt/strap button and never went on tight enough.  I had to put masking tape around the end pin jack to make it fit snugly in the hole I created in the end block of the ukelele.  THEN there was enough resistance to allow me to install the strap button/end bolt very tightly.My biggest beef with this unit is the fact that it takes a 15/32 hole to fit it snugly in the ukelele.  This is an odd size, so you end up using a 7/16 drill bit which is common in most handyman drill bit sets.  Because this is too small, you have to make the hole 1/32"" larger by whatever means you have available.  This was an agonizingly slow process when I tried to do it by hand, using a dowel with sandpaper wrapped around it.  A peg-hole reamer might have done a better job, but I didn't have one.So, I eventually found a dowel and glued some sandpaper to it, shoved it in my drill press, and slowly lifted my 7/16"" hole in the ukelele into the spinning sanpaper dowel.  This took care of the sizing problem in a matter of seconds, although it was not a really tight fit, and necessitated the use of masking tape around the endpin jack in the Mahalo to stablize it in the hole.Also, the directions don't tell you much about the placement of the 3 nuts, 2 flat washers, ragged washer, and strap button/bolt that goes on the end of the jack.  I did it his way, starting from the inside of the ukelele:(Bolt1-Bolt2-thin washer-ragged washer)-- WALL OF THE UKELELE -- (outer thick washer, outer bolt3, outer strap pin/bolt).  The purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2.  This sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which I installed the pickup.Overall, when played through different guitar amps, as well as a mixer/amp/PA system, I was pleased with the results of this unit in a ukelele.  I would buy another if I needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument."
658,277,3.0,"I am not going to say this pickup is the best thing since sliced bread, but it is built solidly and built to last. It is simple, practical, and cheap. There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that. You don't buy $150.00 pickup for a $200-$300 instrument. Being able to plug in and be self-sufficient (in most rooms, especially at open mics) is easier and better than relying on a mic, especially for beginners, because it takes skill and discipline to stay within the mic's sweet spot. Also, some rooms/PA's/hosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument. At least a pickup like this has the potential for keeping the sound front and center. (I will experiment with different instruments & write more about the quality later.)That said, there is only one piezo element, unlike a K&K; pickup, for example. So it is limited in giving you optimal sound, no matter where it is placed. Also, in case you cannot tell from the image, the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack, so it can only be used inside your instrument, which means drilling a hole."
1243,277,4.0,Very authentic sound reproduction. Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear. The threaded end is 'holed' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock. You'll never get your arm in there far enough. LOLYou will need a 15/32nd drill bit to complete the install.
408,277,2.0,"This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes. But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume. The pickup is very, over sensitive.Also, spend some time where exactly you place the pickup, it makes a big difference! Try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something."
433,277,1.0,"I bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic. Learned my lesson. Should of just forked over the money for an a/e. I have a Yamaha F335 I really like. I say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so I thought I'd try it. I first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. I like it, sounded good then I saw this from Axl and I thought I'd try it. Installing it wasn't bad except I bought a set of drill bits I didn't need for $10. So I got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. I just wanted it for playing around at home so I didn't need real great sound quality. But sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves I think quick connect strap connector. My other complaint is I couldn't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching. Overall product quality is good. Setup was ok. Price was good. Sound in my opinion needs some tweaking."
99,277,1.0,"The fact that it is passive really kills it. I just could not get any sound out of it, I tried multiple placements. I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. Not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar."
1201,277,4.0,"I have a lot of guitars and do all the work on them myself.A couple of secrets to installing the mike pickup:After you drill the hole, and are trying to figure out just how to get thejack into place from the inside of the guitar, do this;Get a guitar/patch cable and run it through the hole you just drilled until you can grab it throughthe sound hole. jack into the AXL and then pull it out the hole using your cable. You may have to dothis a couple of times to get the jam nuts set for the right depth, so having a way to make this processeasier is a big help. Also, I did not use the giant endpin collar that came with the assy, as it just takesup a lot of thread space to accomplish nothing.Finding a sweet spot on smaller guitars/ukulele/mandolin's can be close to impossible because the soundhole is actually so small, you can't get your hand in, and finger length is as far as you can go, so in most cases, go in the direction of the low E string side as this is what is typically lacking on the smaller instruments unless you have Jimi Hendrix hands and in that case, congratulations.Finally, on Travel guitars; GET RID OF THE GIANT STRINGS THAT COME ON SOME OF THESE THINGS!My SX traveller came in with 11-54's and I could not even hear the low E string. I had an old set of electric 10-46's I took off of a BB King Lucille, and just for the heck of it swapped them out; Man what a difference; actually so much difference that I really didn't need the AXL I just installed even though it's a fun addition.As far as an amp, I have a little HoneyTone that has been feeling out of place alongside my very large amp arsenal, and just may have found a home, as it is about as small as you can get to go along with the Travel guitar."
1082,277,1.0,This is a hit-or-miss product.  For me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well.  It's not a total loss since I can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution I ended up with.  It was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on.
165,694,4.0,The Taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should. You will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do.
1147,694,3.0,"I bought this to complement a 414ce-LTD (Fall 2011) guitar, and wanted to have something that would last a long time, and provide a nice suede feel to keep the strap from sliding around on my shoulder.It took a little bit to get the hole over the butt peg of the guitar - it almost seemed the slit they cut was too small. After working at it a few minutes, I got it to fit, and it wore really nicely once I got the length where I wanted. Taking it on/off the guitar isn't too much trouble, but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more - enough to make it easier to get it on. I'm glad that it came a little tighter initially - the leather stretches over time, and it's clear they had that in mind when they make these. The quality is excellent, and I'm buying another one to go with my 12-string Taylor."
1120,694,4.0,"I bought this strap for my Taylor guitar.It's a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft.As it says, it is made to fit well on Taylor guitars but can fit in any other guitar as well.The color is pretty much the same as the picture posted.Highly recommended"
1349,694,4.0,Nice to see something well made for a change.  Most guitar straps I see that are less than $80.00 are all cheap and that fake stuff.
811,694,4.0,"This strap is genuine suede leather, so it is really comfortable and has lots of friction, so no sliding around on my shoulders while I'm playing. It's plenty long for any guitar size or shoulder width, and adjusting is just like most leather straps. Taylor logo makes it look good and official.Nothing bad to say about this strap."
1095,486,1.0,"I've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. I figured I'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on, and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on. The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. They were twice as loud as these. When you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. They don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros:-Very flexible, string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons:-The most dull sound of any strings I've ever heard. Especially on the low end. They're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. The highs are very tinny. Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. It's the weirdest thing. This is especially true for the G string. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. Anyways, it sucks. Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line: Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. I'll never buy again. This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings."
327,486,4.0,"The reason they are called silk and phosphor is that the wound strings have silk along with steel in their cores (the wire around which the windings are wound) rather than just steel.  This allows them to tune to pitch with less tension, so they can be the ideal string for a beginner or someone who is moving from nylon.  There are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings.  The lower tensions and light gauges mean that they may not drive some guitar tops hard enough to let them perform up to their capability.  That is, they may sound soft and cheap.  I would not put them on most Martin dreadnoughts, for example.  But they may work fine on lightly braced guitars. The only way to find out for sure is to experiment.These are an experiment for me, I usually use silk-and-steel on my guitar banjo, it was time to change strings, and I stumbled across these.  I'll have to see where things settle down, but so far I'm willing to give these silk-and-phosphor the nod over silk-and-steel.  The sound is a bit brighter.  My music partner says she prefers the way these silk-and-phosphor blend with her fiddle.This is so ""out there"" that I won't let it influence my rating.  My guitar-banjo's tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass.  The ends of the windings at the bottoms of the bare steel 1st and 2nd strings stick out a bit, so I had trouble putting them on.  I was able to use a fine wire cutter to nip the end of the 1st string, but it didn't work for the 2nd string.  I ended up using a D'Addario string of the same gauge in its place.  Admittedly, it was a tight fit, but I was able to put it on without working on it."
252,486,4.0,What's not to love about these strings? The sound is fantastic ... they ring like they should. But my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long.
896,486,2.0,These sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report.Had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing.They sound OK
1143,486,4.0,"I have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar, as that's what I learned on as a child. I can't afford it at the moment, so I decided to give these a shot.These do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination. I didn't expect them to - but a guy can dream, can't he?Anyway, what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly-bright Takamine. It also helped with the rather high action. They play and sound softer. It's almost like having a new guitar.During the stringing/stretching process I broke the G string (go easy, they are silk after all) and so had to use a standard bronze replacement. I asked my non-music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the 'oddball' string and she got it right on the first try.. that's how much of a difference these strings make. They sound less 'metallic' - that may sound obvious but my point is that it's a big difference, enough for her untrained ears to hear.I'm still saving up for a classical, but I really love these strings, and will be using them on my Tak going forward."
476,486,4.0,"These strings are so soft to the touch that they almost feel like ""flat-wound"" acoustic guitar strings. When you uncoil them out of the wrapper they don't spring out like most other strings but sort of flop out like a string string instead of a wire wrapped in wire. They sound wonderful but I swear the feel easier to play and I was doing things with them I usually am pretty clumsy at with my mitts. They won't last as long as coateds of course but they have a depth and a character all their own worth checking out and you may find, like me, that it's worth going back to changing them out every few weeks to get the fresh sound. If you're really an acoustic guitar aficionado, you'll want to try these. The almost play themselves IMO. And that makes me want to play twice as long."
1010,836,4.0,"Pack of 10 guitar picks - check""Meet the Beatles"" theme - checkRetail packaging - checkTwo-day delivery (got it the next day... thanks to Prime) - checkHappy guitarist - checkI can't really complain about anything, except maybe for the price.  But then again, I didn't HAVE TO buy these.  They are fun and kitschy.  5-stars."
1223,836,4.0,This was a gift for a friend who is a Beatles fan. I bought him two different types he he liked them both. These will not be used much.
1366,836,4.0,"For some reason these picks have a better feel, flexibility and grip than any I have found in a long time. They aren't that expensive (especially as an add-on) and they're relly cool."
1063,836,3.0,i'd say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection. i don't use them all too often because they're a bit too stiff though.
618,836,4.0,If you use a medium pick for playing these are really cool picks to play with and about the same price as a fender or dunlop medium pick.  For a Beatles collector what a great price for a neat Beatles product.  Even the packaging it cool.If you need picks for playing or a neat Beatles product to collect you won't be dissipointed with this purchase.Excellent product from a fantastic seller.
929,836,3.0,"I JUST RECEIVED MY 10 PACK PLANET WAVES BEATLE COLLECTORS PICK, GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE COLLECTION, ONLY THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT YOU DIDN'T GET 15 SEPARATE ONES, THEY ARE ALL DUPLICATES, SO BESIDES THAT THEY ARE GREAT"
1326,642,2.0,"This is my first noise reducer. It works and like it says it reduces the noise. it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch. The switch let you choose if you want it to reduce the noise when is activated or to mute everything when activated. The 2 knobs, 1 of them let you select the range of the noise you want to reduce, the other one how fast you want it to start reducing the noise. I noticed a slight change of the original sound of my distortion, but it could be also because i didn't find the right setup. if the knob of the noise to reduce is on the highest setting, then it reduce also the sound of the all guitar, so you really gotta study this before you can use it properly. overall, for the price i'm happy with it, and it hides the hiss and all the other sounds unwanted."
345,642,3.0,"I have several Behringer pedals, all placed in a Behringer 6-pedal board. Most of the B. pedals work quite well. I have no quality issues with them. Some people complain about the plastic cases, but they are tough and reliable unless you're in the habit of abusing your pedals by smashing them around or can't control your &#34;stomp&#34; pressure. Some are better than others, and this one works perfectly. I have 6 B. pedals (one of them is a tuner), and each seems to add some noise to the amp output, especially when it is in quiescent mode (no signal input).This pedal, placed at the end of the line just before the signal goes into the amp, quiets all that noise that the other pedals generate. I had to check this, because I at first thought my amp was making the noise, but when I bypassed all the pedals, my amp was quiet, which was a relief. Then I needed relief from the pedal noise, and this did the trick.The controls are a little misleading, but easy to get used to and adjust. The &#34;send-receive&#34; function is for quieting the noise you send to an additional effects pedal, which seems pointless, as the best way to use this is to put it at the end of the chain to quiet all the effects.The mute function may help, but when I turn on my pedal tuner, this also functions as a mute.I had to do a little modification of the B. pedal board to make this fit in, as I already had 6 pedals in place. But, with the removal of a couple of screws, it fit into a slot meant for a longer pedal.I don't actually need the on-off function on this most of the time, so placing it in that sideways, out of the way spot was no disadvantage. I just leave it on all the time so it always quiets the noise when I'm not actually playing. However, I can still operate it if necessary, for example for the mute function if I needed that.It's aggravating to have to have a pedal to eliminate noise from other pedals, but at least there is an easy solution in a noise gate like this one."
226,642,4.0,I wanted a noise reducer because I have like 10 pedals and the loud feedback I was getting back through them was insane. I got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not? It's like $25. It was a great choice. The pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesn't alter your tone. It does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden. It's great.
1195,642,4.0,"- it's simple to operate- it does what it's made to do- it does that very well- it's bargaintasticIf you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one, then I highly recommend this unit.I'm about to get a second one and put all my distortion-creating devices in the loop (other Behringer units, Rat, Big Muff, etc etc). The one I already have can stay at the end of my signal chain, just before the delays. Pretty much a must-have for recording, especially during those quiet spots :-) Thanks to this unit I have a very quiet recording setup."
904,642,4.0,"Cleans up the hum, going in to effects pedals , some pedals make noise, some don't as much with this it cleans them all.Behringer all the way, you can keep your expensive boss pedals."
422,642,4.0,"this  noise reducer pedal  gets probably 90-95% noise off, using heavy-noisy distortion pedals & has an amazing value.100% recommended !!!!"
1249,642,4.0,"When it comes to noise gates, this definitely does the trick. It had a noise-detection sensor, so it knows when you are playing guitar or not, and will turn itself on and off automatically. This means that while you're not playing, it'll block that annoying static sound your guitar and pedals make - and when you start playing, it'll lower itself so that it doesn't effect the noise of the guitar. It'll sound the same. I would defeinitely recommend. Plus Behringer is the best brand for pedals."
1128,642,4.0,IT does the job as described it though. I have no complains and the cheap price was a plus for me.
945,642,4.0,"I have a strat running into a crate amp with a tub preamp and it picked up noise like mad.  this pedal is like an automatic volume knob that turns down the input if there isn't a signal from the guitar.  takes a little playing with it to get it dialed in, but now I just keep it on all of the time."
1305,642,4.0,"great pedall for the money it makes ur pedalls real quaiet,, it does what its soupose to.. german mind great electronics, well made but plastic,"
1166,642,3.0,"It cuts down the buzz left by the other pedals, for that price it's pretty good, not badly built either."
575,642,4.0,"If the hiss from your distortion and compression pedals irritates you, this is worth the money. Contrary to the name, it is a noise gate rather than a noise reducer. It does not filter out noise, but rather stops the signal to the amp entirely when the sound from the instrument reaches a predetermined minimum. If you are playing with humbuckers, your only problem will be pedal hiss and you will never hear it again. If you are playing on single coils, the hum while you play is so minimally noticeable that this is still worthwhile. Whether you're gigging and don't want to sound like an amateur or you're practicing in headphones at 4am, this will make your playing sound a little better, and you can't complain about that."
667,642,4.0,"This baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price. One does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming & noise, for one doesn't know which in or output is actually making the interference but, once you've established that, it's all good baby!!!"
832,642,4.0,"I'm not a big fan of pedals at all, I much prefer multi effects but, that being say this is a great cheap pedal. Does what it should just like the noise gate in my rack."
455,642,4.0,"I've used this live since I got it and it works great, no problems. Its made of plastic but that doesn't effect anything, its pretty tough. It has two modes, noise reduction which clips the noise and silences it when the note fades out, and mute which lets you mute with the stomp switch. I use the mute mode live to silence my bass in between sets but I have also used the reduction mode when my pickups were noisy. Both modes work great and there is a sensitivity knob to dial in the right clipping. Full on it will clip the notes hard and sometimes register quieter notes as noise and clip them all together, less and its more subtle. Great value and a great tool."
1319,642,4.0,"I gave this product 5 stars , simply because it did exactly what I bought it to do - reduce unwanted noise to my amp. You will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to. It doesn't cut noise while your playing , but when your not it comes on a kills the noise. There are two lights on the pedal, one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise. If you have it set to high or to sensitive , it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise . So play with it and find your personal setting because I'm sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp. The NR300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you , you will be happy with it. Oh, and if you switch it to Mute, it works as an on and off switch.. You also can not beat the price----"
268,642,2.0,havent used it yet.. seems like a nice pedal .. nice an lightweight... clean..has some nice rubber on the bottom.. lol haha okaaaaaay?
925,783,4.0,"I already had two Behringer stompboxes, and am thinking of adding a few more, so I thought rather than having a mess on the stage, I'd get a pedalboard.  I hadn't really studied them too much, except to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth.  Then, recently I found this one for less than a hundred bucks, so I really couldn't pass it up.  I am very impressed with this unit.  It is well made, well designed, and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories.  Nothing is lacking to start playing right away.  I'm not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board (you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit), but I think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have.  I am not disappointed in the least.  I think you will like this board."
1249,783,4.0,"This is a very good investment. Everything just sits in this case  so I never have to set up any cables again. All I do is setup the input from guitar to the case, from the case to the amp, and let's not forget the power cable. It works amazing and saves plenty of time. I've also seen reviews that it's VERY druable, so you don't have to worry about it breaking easily. I love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals (such as wah or volume). The only concern by some people was a slight buzzing. I replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals, and the sound went away. I would recomment this to anyone who travels alot, doesn't have a lot of space in their room, or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time. This item is VERY convienent!"
845,783,3.0,"I got this to eliminate all of the cords that powered the effects units as well as get something to house everything securely.  This board does the job for at least 6 pedals.  The Behringer pedals fit nicely into the foam slots and so far have not moved around during play. What I have to get used to is that the pedals are no longer against the floor, meaning that I not have to lift my foot higher to get over the boards edge to press them.  It should just take some getting used too.  One concern is that the linked power cables don't have anyplace to disappear into. I will be working on this. What I am not happy about is that the board is ALWAYS ON when plugged in.  The only way to shut off the power is to unplug it.  I wish it had a power switch."
420,20,3.0,"I really like this thumb pick  The only thing I dispute is that this may be a large (for a girl) but NO WAY is it a large for a man.  I think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably.  So, Ladies!  This is a good purchase...not so much for a guy."
1357,20,2.0,"Others that reviewed this Item I read before purchase, noted it is not &#34;Large&#34; and the picks have to be warmed and shaped to fit your thumb. I also found in original &#34;Large&#34; size, The curve of the pick will cut into your thumb from improper shaping and being too small for the average American man. I am still in the process of shaping all 5, but otherwise they appear sturdy and I haven't broken more than one of similar type in several years. I expect the pick to wear down from use. They appear to be about the same quality as Indigo brand, but not shaped as well for the average player."
1407,20,2.0,"These are fine but didn't fit well; but they are a quality product. In my case, I actually needed medium or small to fit tight."
1007,20,4.0,"I like these, nice tortoise look with planet wave logo is nice, they have more flex than most which I also find suits me.They ride a little higher for me, which I also like, but if you like low, let's say midway across cuticle, may find a bit pinchy?  But I find the gauge suits me great and overall comfort is good, for my average thumb size."
398,20,4.0,"I have an unusually wide and fat thumb, and though tight at first, all of them got comfortable after an hour of playing (each). No complaints"
1229,20,3.0,"Ordered these large picks and like others mentioned, they are not large at all. I have average size hands and thumbs and the pick initially numbed my thumb in about twenty seconds it was so tight. I solved the problem by simply holding a Bic lighter flame about a half inch away from the heel of the pick for just about three seconds. I could feel the celluloid loosen up quickly. It was just a matter of pulling the pick open just a bit. It's actually easy to completely customize the size and shape of the picks with just a few seconds of heat. The picks fit fine now, and I didn't even need to place &#34;foreign&#34; objects into the microwave to do it.Any questions just feel free to ask and I will answer best I can. Thanks.SPO"
37,20,2.0,they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time. they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do.
558,20,3.0,"I did get 5 thumb picks in my order (a previous reviewer mentioned only getting 4), and I always really liked the classic turtle-shell look (far more purty-like than the plain, thick white of Nationals and others).  But these are large? And, yes, I double checked the packaging to ensure I was shipped large. The National mediums I was using before had a looser fit -boggle-.  But nevertheless, the Planet Waves' far tighter fit actually feel better than the National mediums, which certainly had a clunky sensation; there is probably a small weight difference between the two that would explain the overall feeling of quicker movement while having good solid interactions on the strings.  All in all, 4 stars.  Still... these were a large?  Hate to see how the mediums fit."
1392,283,2.0,"V5 = 4 starBugera customer service = -5 starsLets be realistic, this is a very inexpensive tube amp. Nothing more, nothing less.Its price reflects exactly what it is, and thats a good thing, and also not so good.First off, the amp shipped with bad tubes. (microphonic)Not a big deal, it happens all the time. But ...Bugera was no help at all, their customer service is by far the worst Ive ever dealt with.They are clueless, arrogant and condescending.I bought replacement tubes and solved the issue, but thats not the point.This experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another Bugera/Behringer product.Now about the amp itself.Its ok, at best. It has no headroom, even on the 5w setting. I realize a tiny combo wont have much, but this thing has nothing.It clips far too easily, and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it. You will only get a muddy, garbled mess.Clean tones are ok, but dont expect Fender type cleans, they arent there.Think of Marshall cleans, or even Vox.The speaker isnt worth the paper its made from.I plugged the amp into a Celestion 1x12 cab (just for comparison) and it was a whole lot better.Its built very well, even compared to many amps costing far more. If youre looking for a ""vintage"" tube amp, but either cant afford or cant justify the price of a good one, you should try a V5.Im the latter, because I only play at home I simply cant justify $1K or more for a good tube amp.The classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp. If youre looking for a late 60s - 70s ""cranked"" amp stack tone, well, its here. But only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low.Turn up the preamp and all you'll get is a flat, flubby ""farty"" unusable tone.I love and hate the V5, though the price is unbeatable, its shortcomings (no headroom/horrid overdrive) are hard to live with.You sometimes what you pay for, and in this case, if you want that vintage 70s tone at ""bedroom"" volumes, you cant go wrong with the V5."
1282,283,4.0,"I should start by saying that I did not buy this from Amazon. Not that it's a bad price, but I got a discount on an open box demo unit at a local Guitar Center for $179.00. I've seen them cheaper for used ones, but I wanted a new one with a warranty.I am using this amp for an electric violin and for an acoustic violin with a pickup. I wanted the cleanest sound, with bare bones controls and that's what this little champ provides. Most of the time, I use it with the Gain on 1 or 2 and the Volume past 5.It's very cool that it has 5w, 1w, and .1w settings. I haven't seen that in any amp in this price range. The 1w setting is perfect for my studio, and the .1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack. The 5w setting can really crank out the volume.You could spend about $100 more and get a Vox AC4 series all tube amp. That's another amp I was considering. I wanted something not too big and portable, but could use at home without shredding the walls. But the Vox doesn't even have Reverb like the Bugera which has only a single pre-amp tube. And the Vox is 4w, while the Bugera boasts 5w.I know if I plugged an electric guitar in and cranked the gain I could get some lovely distortion, because I've tried that with the violin. The digital reverb has a spacious feel. I love reverb and wouldn't buy an amp without it.It seems to be built well and only time will tell if it holds up under daily use, which I plan to do. When it comes time to change the tube, there are many choices for a nice upgrade to something better than the stock Bugera tube. I've even read online where people drop in a different speaker, but in my opinion the Bugera 8"" speaker is just fine and sounds like a bigger one.All in all, I'm very pleased. I also tried the Bugera V22 all tube amp at the same Guitar Center. But, that's way too much amp for me at this time. If I were to fill a large hall with sound, that would be the way to go. The V22 is sweet. I had never heard of Bugera until I tried that model and was really impressed. Another option is to unplug the speaker in the V5, (yes, the speaker has a plug and a jack!) and drive another speaker cabinet, which Bugera also makes. You can use any speaker cabinet, I guess, that has a minimum of 4 OHMS, which is clearly written near the jack.The Bugera V5 is perfect for me, and I wouldn't go down to the smaller Bugera BC15. I think Bugera has hit the nail on the head with quality and value, and I'll be looking into other products made by Bugera/Behringer/Music Group. The seem to be all the same company."
283,283,4.0,This little amp gives a warm and gritty sound. Arrived in days and free ship (heavy little bugger). Small footprint allows me to place in my studio and get that deep sound like a big tube amp. Use a Shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing. Recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue. Really happy with sound.
176,283,4.0,This amp really surprized me. It's made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great. There is a headphone jack which is why I bought it.I would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal. gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether. But over all this amp is a most welcome deal. No transistor amp I own sounds as good. but I would suggest pedals
1050,283,4.0,"This is a great little amp especially for the money. It's all tube, has a power attenuator, headphone out and reverb all for under $200 - CRAZY!! It's built extremely well and has some weight to it, but you'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig. A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD, so the attenuator is a god-send.How does it sound you ask? Tone is subjective, but to my ears it can get quite ""Marshally"" without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele. I don't own a Strat, so I can't comment on single coils through it. On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good ""Back In Black"" style hard rock tone. If you want to play Metal you're going to need a distortion/overdrive pedal. I've found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy. The headphone out isn't great, it's good enough for practice, but don't try to use it as a line out for recording.I've done some recording using a 57 on-axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center. When stacking 3-4 tracks (especially using different guitars) I got a HUGE, Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy.I haven't swapped tubes or the speaker - it's completely stock. I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it, but the stock tone is just fine as it is. The stock speaker is an 8"" Bugera ""vintage"" (think greenback clone) and it is darker than a lot of small speakers. A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJ's or GT's, but it all depends on what you're after for tone.A lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it (Bugera is made by Beringer), but I found this amp to be very good quality - especially given that it was made in China.I would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap. It's an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type. I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily. Good stuff!!"
383,283,4.0,"I'd give this baby six stars if I could. My prior practice amp (a Vox) was very nice, but finally went south and required replacement. I was looking for something with a great tube sound, as most of the solid-state amps that I've used (mainly fenders and line6 stuff) just don't get there. I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side. The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store, I was blown away (and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store). I've gotta say, part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior, but the Bugera actually sounded better. The only one left in the store was the floor model, so I grabbed it.Got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations:- It's solid and heavy. It's still a small-fry (slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there), but much heavier.- The construction is great. I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction, but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it's built to last.- The sound is even better at home (without the GC cacophony)- Adjustments are minimal, but enough. The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp. I've run my Strat, Tele and Taylor T5 through this. I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone, but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great. I was really surprised by this. I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone, but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones- The price is self-explanatory, but that's really the part that blew me away. This amp would sell for double the price tag."
51,283,4.0,"Once I read about the Bugera B5, I knew I wanted one.  Why futz with tube-like effects when you can have real, live tubes -- two in fact!  Only five Watts, yes, but that's still enough to fill a room.  But it's the extras that cinch the deal: this is built like a brick house -- you can jump up and down on it if you want to.  It has an internal cable for the speaker, so you can easily plug in a different cabinet.  Comes with built-in reverb.  Headphone jack standard.  Best of all: an attenuator, so you can get the cranked sound even at low volume levels.  Easily upgradeable -- I put new tubes and speaker into mine, though I probably didn't have to.  A small but effective little amp.Edit: I had modded my Bugera with a Jensen MOD-8 and used it for bass, but recently I found a source for Celestion Super 8 drivers and popped one of those in.  Amazing low-end output for such a small cab!"
1386,283,4.0,"I admit I got this from Guitar Center on clearance, but over the past week or so I've had it, I just love plugging into it. I've got a great vintage larger amp, but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions, and I'm anticipating spending some time in apartment living, so I was looking for a small, tube-based amp. This thing gives great tone with both a Strat and a Les Paul clone, and an overdrive pedal works very well with it. Of course it's not too loud - that's the whole point! I should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps don't have, but it's really low volume. Also, the tubes do take a minutes to warm up, and since it doesn't have a standby switch, you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in. But it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears (or those of anyone else). Great little amp."
1292,757,3.0,"This is a highly feature-full amp at this price point. I can get great clean, blues and heavy metal tones. Like most Line 6 products, some features are not highly apparent. For example, for extra gain, you can hold down the tuner button and turn the gain knob past 12 o'clock for a boost. This may not sound like much, but it really CAN change the tone, even on clean channels. On the crunch channel, for example, it gives the guitar an almost fuzz face overdriven sound (with my Strat). On the metal channels, it really drives the gain over the top.The tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are OK. I decided to go with the cheaper FBV2 pedal (which is still over 1/3 the price of this amp!) and it really works well for home practice situations. One can switch between clean and metal, or clean and blues without too much trouble (one click). I think the pedals are too expensive personally, but they are well constructed solid steel and seem very durable. The cable is a simple cat 5 network cable I believe, so replacing should be trivial.I live in an apartment and this little 15-watt amp is WAY too loud to turn up past 1 or 2. It has a great tone balance (to my ears). It has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesn't! Overall I recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp."
890,757,4.0,"After registering the amp online (or by mail) you have access to 500+ backing tunes,with either drums or drums and bassline. You are able to select from different genres such as Rock, Blues, Country, Alternative and more. Along with this great feature, you can also take free lessons, from beginner to advanced. You can even get custom settings, giving you the sound of such great bands as Green Day, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and many more. Along with lessons, tabs, and the ability to loop any Jam Track, Spider Online adds more than even I immagined to this awesome amp!! If you're still hesitant about buying this or any other Spider amp, just buy it. I personally guarantee your satisfaction...BUY IT!! (no seriously, are you buying it??)"
120,757,4.0,Never has 15 watts sounded so loud and clear. Never think it only hadan 8 inch speaker. Just enough effects to leave your pedals at home for practices.Light weight easy to carry.
127,757,3.0,"I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar, I've got it this weekend and I'm very satisfied with this product. I'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions, with complete add-ons on th webpage. Solid, nice sound, very good quality to make anyone happy, except your neighbors.Now after a couple of months I want to say... this is great product in terms of sound, not so great in terms of small building detailsGreat for Blues style, just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch  and you will get amazing blues sounds.My only con and that's why I have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also, the Phones are not working. Better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen. I wrote to Line6 and I got useless answers about."
176,757,3.0,"this amp really shines in the distortion modes, I don;t really care for the clean sounds but the metal tones are as good as I've ever heard out of a low cost amp. I wish I had found this amp sooner. It blows the other brands away"
433,757,4.0,A good modeling amp. My only complaint is I didn't like the clean sounds not to my liking. Other than that an awesome amp.
822,757,1.0,"I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. If you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. But with the hybrid amps (Vibro Champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. From now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. Like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the Line 6 isnt too bad. Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb?"
1053,757,3.0,"I've had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it. It's choice of effects is thorough for a beginner like me. I don't have the greatest guitar ever but the sounds from the amp are clean and crisp. The choice of effects is nice with reverb, tremolo, delay, among other less-useful effects. The auxillary jack is also a great addition. The amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use."
1215,757,4.0,"This little amp is awesome, I once had a Peavey Bandit 112 back in the day, and this little guy can do all it could do, it just doesn't get as loud, but at least you won't have to worry about someone calling the cops on you for being too loud, but is gets just loud enough, so be careful."

471,645,4.0,"I got this amp recently, at a local store, and so far im loving it, i also aqcuired the MKII Foot Controller and is a perfect combination. Tons of sounds and it can be 100% edited to fit your demands. Nice volume coming out of it also, for 75 watts it seems more.Recommended"
1194,645,3.0,"I don't gig. It is unlikely that I will ever play in front of a crowd. But if you're like me, play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres, this amp is a blast. It is very likely that I will play a Johnny Cash song on Tuesday and a Metallica song on Wednesday. Pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound. No pedals, no hours of minor tweaks, just punch it up and learn the song. Virtually every genre is represented here. I also have to mention that although I like metal, I rarely play it. I prefer traditional R'n'R sounds and the Spider IV recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds. Even with the best modeling in the world, my Les Paul does not sound like a Strat being played through 65' Fender. It sounds digital. No getting around it.Something else that weighed into my purchase was durability. Although I only play for fun, I still play 2-3 hours a day. My 9 year old also is learning to play, so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily. The one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of Line 6 amps was that they were long lasting and durable. I have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger 120 just becuase they can take such a beating.Ultimately I decided that for the price ($300 at the time), I couldn't beat the Line 6. There is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp. They sound better, more prefessional. They are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes. Although the Line 6 sounds tinny and at max volume, for in home play, it sounds terrific. There are mountains of reviews that compare the Line 6 to Vox, Marshall or Fender. They are ALL better than the Line6, every one of them. But be prepared to pay 10 times the price for effects pedals, head units, cabinets, cables, etc. to get those flawless professional sounds. Good amp, great value."
520,645,4.0,"I had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing.  Ultimately, my search was narrowed down to this Spider and a Fender Mustang.  After reading many Amazon reviews, I ultimately chose the Spider over the Fender because (i) I read that the Fender amps gave off a hissing noise, particularly with the clean channels, and (ii) the Spider had better rock/metal tones, which is one genre I play, among others.  Regarding the sound, it is unbelievable!  And, to be quite honest, I've only been using the presets!  The cleans are ultra clear, and the rock tones are amazing.  And, this thing is LOUD.  In conducting some internet research, having a mega-watted amp is not necessary and is, in fact, not recommended.  I discovered that the reason for this is because the ""sweet spot"" for the volume is going to be when the amp is about three-quarters of the way up.  In home practice, unless you aren't married and live in the boonies, you won't get there.  With live play, this could hold it's own and in the sweet spot.  As another reviewer mentioned, if you need something louder because you're in a larger venue, the amp will be mic'd anyway.One note...Line 6 does somewhat force you to purchase one of the pedals because you need the pedal to update the amp.  I purchased theLine 6 FBV Express MkII 4-button Foot Controller, and I'm very happy with it.  I like the larger foot pedal switches on this 4-pedal switch, rather than the small buttons on the model up from that (a 6 button pedal board).Finally, I chose this Spider IV over the Spider IV 120 amp version, in part, because this Spider has a larger speaker (a 12"") and the other Spider IV 120 watt model has two 10"" speakers.  I feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones."
1200,645,4.0,"I started two years ago with a 15 watt Spider III, then along with other amps, bought a Spider Jam. I thought they were all great.  Now they come out with Spider IV, and the difference in the sound is dramatic.  They are getting very, very close to tube sound.  So much so that for the lousy $299, compared to say $1000+ for 75 watts of tube, this is a real steal.Loaded with features, and hundreds of presets, it has something for everyone. The Pitch Shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun. And it will work with either generation of FBV pedalboard. Says so right in the manual. The only difference I see is with the generation II pedal you get a USB port.Does it sound as creamy and smooth as my Peavey Delta Blues or Crate Palomino tube units?  No, there is still a little digital overlay around in there.  But most people who are looking for a great home based amp, or maybe a church or small gig amp, this is a WINNER and the price is just nuts.  Forget the Peavy Vyper, this is hands down much better and you don't have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the Vyper."
547,645,4.0,Wow! This little amp packs tons of tone & sound. Hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully. The  clean channels are really clean & the dirty channels are just plain nasty. 75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off. Lots of bang for the buck here.
273,645,4.0,"I own several tube amp combo and half-stack. However, I wanted a smaller, lighter combo that would be easy to transport and wouldn't need any pedals, but would also be loud enough to practice with a drummer. The line 6 spider IV 75-watt combo was the perfect solution. Up to this point I haven't been very impressed by solid-state technology. Sure, the cleans are glassy and crystal-clear, and some sound ok with the gain cranked and mids scooped at super low volume, but as soon as you turn up the volume a bit or try to dial in a smooth, bluesy overdrive, the sound turns to crap. Not so with the spider IV. I've been extremely impressed with all the different amp models. ALL of them. The different amp models each have their unique sound and characteristics, which means that your tonal options are literally limitless. I play mostly metal and hard rock, thougn I use less gain and more mids than is typical among players of the genre.I'd describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge. And I was able to get that tone in less than a minute of fiddling. The tone in general is surprisingly warm and organic- very tube-like, which is a comparison that I don't make lightly. Additionally, the highs don't have that artificial ""tinny"" sound that so often occurs in solid-state. Solos and leads have more of the natural, smooth quality that tube amps are valued for.The effects are fun to play with, though I've never used many effects in my playing. I really like having multiple user pre-sets, so I can dial in the tones that I use the most and then switch between them at the press of a button. The artist pre-sets are cool; it's interesting to see Line 6's take on the sound of many popular bands and songs. Some are surprisingly good, like Cliffs of Dover, Master of Puppets, and Sunshine of Your Love, while others don't really sound like the artist, like Killswitch Engage.I'm also impressed with the quality of the celestion speaker that comes with the amp; it holds up pretty well even at higher volumes. The tone has continually improved as I've broken in the speaker.Just in conclusion, there's basically nothing this amp can't do at least fairly well. All the amp models actually sound good (can't say the same about my roland cube), and when you combine that with all the effects, tuner, mp3 connection, and user and song & artist presets, it's a winning combination. This will never be my main stage amp, but for practice purposes I couldn't be more pleased with the spider IV.*edited to add*: A few months later I bought the FBV express pedal board. It's a simple, affordable way to get more out of the amp by making channel switching easy and adding a volume/wah pedal. Especially if this is your main amp, I recommend getting a FBV pedal to go with it."
1110,39,4.0,"The so called lower priced brother to the enormous Line 6 FBV Shortboard MKII pedal, while cut down still has a lot of the same features. Same quality build. Self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp (a real nice feature). One less power supply to hook up. Foot switches are easy to use. Built in tuner works great. The volume/wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press. Programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp ""sounds"" and have them instantly available when you play (either at home or on stage)."
494,39,4.0,"This is an essential accessory for the excellent Line 6 Spider IV combo amps,  For more details, see my review of the Line 6 Spider IV 75 watt combo.  The FBV Express Mk II is the least expensive pedal to give one full control over all basic and essential amp features. This pedal should have been ( or be) included with the amp but it wasn't.  Anyway, if you are considering buying the amp (which is great), you really will want to have this pedal, even though it costs 33% of the price of the amp itself.With the FBV Express Mk II you can store the 4 amp channels, each of which has its own settings for model and all effects, as well as control the 14 second looping ability of the Spider IV.  The pedal also adds a volume/way pedal (the wah pedal is OK but not as full-throated as a Cry Baby or other stand-alone wah wahs).  Without the pedal, you will not be able to access looping and channel switching in real time while playing (which is the whole point of this thing) unless you have more than the standard compliment of 2 arms, equipped with one  hand each.The pedal also interfaces with a computer to allow deep editing and storing of all of the effects of the Line 6 Spider IV combos through a USB port.  This feature alone makes it a must-have for taking full advantage of the amp.J.M. Tepper"
940,39,4.0,This foot controller is wonderful switch between all four channels and the volume pedal wah pedal and built in tuner makes it the complete package for my line 6 amp!!!
1249,39,4.0,"This thing works wonders. If you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot I recommend. I hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels, and this just is perfect for the job. The pedals are all easy to press and I love the volume/wah 2-in-1 pedal. I just use it as a volume, because I already have a wah pedal. The tuner works amazing as well. I also love the fact that it connects to your amp via RJ45 ethernet cable."
757,39,4.0,I use this on my spider iv 75 it works great I've had it for about 2 months and no issues.
419,716,4.0,I am proud to have this product. Fits my fender well looks amazing! Great quality in it also. I am pleased
698,716,4.0,When you are upgrading your Fender to a gold package nothing completes the upgrade like a gold Fender jack plate.
901,763,1.0,"not so pleased with this, the seller is fine, no prob. there, its that this mic for my use is useless, it records tooo low, cant get enough volume from it"
159,763,4.0,"I have used alot of different mics over the years to mic drums, and this Microphone is actually good enough for vocals and sounds decent through my mixer..  I would reccommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants a good peice of sound equipment."
1208,763,2.0,"No problems with seller and product came quick. I wasnt expecting much from the mic. I mean c'mon what can you expect for that price. I wanted it to lay down some quick vocal melodies over rough tracks and it's good enough for that. Doesn't have a really great range, I think the RockBand mic has a better range than this, but like I said, it's a cheap mic so what can you expect. Honestly I should have saved my money and been a little more patient to get a better mic."
1360,763,4.0,This is a really nice microphone. It sounds really good and the worth far exceeds the minimal price. I would buy this again.
318,763,2.0,"I'm surprised that the maker of Amazon's popular AT2020 would go this low.  The mic, imo, is fully-valued, even at its single-digit price.  It's ""dynamic"" rather than ""condenser,"" but it still requires loads of power to get it up to workable levels (phantom power, which is a requirement for condenser mics, would probably not add sufficient heft). It's very lightweight and, with its optional plug and on/off switch, is versatile enough.  The quality of the sound, moreover, isn't bad--providing you can hear it.  Be prepared to have plenty of watts on hand to coax any appreciable sensitivity from this non-responsive creature.  (I haven't tested it for recording purposes.)  Despite appearances, this mic is no bargain."
731,206,2.0,This tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tune.It is good deal for the money
47,206,4.0,"It's about the size of a credit card, and half as thick as a deck of cards.  It's fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it's supposed to do.  You can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable.  It has a switch to change between Bass and Guitar, and it accounts for the extra strings on 5 string basses or 7 string guitars.It also has a button to tune it down lower (5 half steps) so you can do some alternate tunings too.Lastly it has a button for &#34;Sound&#34; so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually.  The display is very fine and kinda hard to read, but it has lights above the LCD screen to show if it's flat, in tune or sharp, so you can focus on that if you have trouble.It comes with 2 AAA batteries.  I have no idea how long they'll last yet but I have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later."
375,206,4.0,"This product was recommended to me by one of the books I am reading, and I must admit I was scared to death when I opened the package. My guitar has a built in tuner, so I found my room mate's guitar that was totally out of tune and just began tuning. I remembered &#34;Eddie Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddie&#34; and just tuned away. It was easy, easy, easy and I realized what to do within mere moments. Money very well spent and highly recommended. I have an acoustic/ electric and it has multiple settings. I found what I was comfortable with, and just tuned to standard. Could not be any happier! Get this product!!!"
536,206,4.0,"I've had one of these for several years and it has proven to be cheap, durable, and reasonably accurate.  I own several different tuners and what I like about this one is that the microphone works well and is accurate for tuning an acoustic guitar.  Batteries last a long time if you turn the tuner off after you use it.  At ten dollars, I think it's a no-brainer.  It's the perfect size and price to throw one in every gig bag you own."
131,206,4.0,"I got this for Christmas last year ,as a beginner learning guitar ,this is a must have , works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadn't had to replace the battery's yet,, and I tune my guitar every time I play,  well worth it,, its so easy to use,"

584,206,4.0,"Cheap, Accurate over mic, even better over jack. Slot for your pick or coin is a joke and so far hasn't fit a pick or coin i stuck in it but that's just a dumb gimmick. Great pocket tuner."
93,206,3.0,"Well, i just got started playing guitar, and needed a tuner. This thing works well so far, but i didn't have the proper 1/4 inch connector yet to hook my guitar straight into the tuner, which i think would have made it work better. So i used the built-in microphone to tune my guitar. Had no problem with the first through fourth strings, but it had a very hard time picking up the much lower fifth and sixth strings. However, i found that the other strings were very well tuned when all was said and done, and i am happy with my purchase."
105,206,3.0,"I don't know much about guitar tuners, but I am sure you can pay for a more expensive one, but this one does the job.  It was not hard to figure out how to use it, and the Fender is a happier guitar for it."
716,206,4.0,"One of the best & accurate tuners that I have ever used. I have been playing guitar for 45 years & at this size & accuracy, you cannot beat this handy tuner. Fits in most guitar cases & is lightweight. A good tool to have for a guitar players bag of tricks."
457,206,4.0,"Wow! This tuner is currently the absolute best value in my home studio. It gets used daily! If you know anybody who has even the slightest use for this, get it! They won't be disappointed unless they tune below drop D."
153,206,4.0,"I saw this tuner in the local music store for $30 and decided to order it here for $11. Within 5 minutes I had my guitar tuned and it sounds perfect. I compared the plug in tuning to the microphone tuning and it was identical! I honestly expected some variance but it was dead on. I have never heard my guitar sound so good. I am super impressed with this little thing. If ever I need another one, this is the only one I will get."
494,178,0.0,"I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around.  Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $10, how could I go wrong?  Oops! Wrong.  The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it.  The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow.  This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support.  Live and learn."
65,178,4.0,Had one of these before but had given it away when I gave my old guitar away...wanted one again so found this one and bought it. Works well!
334,178,0.0,"I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all.  The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor.  Maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric.  But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand.  I'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero."
391,178,4.0,I JUST BOUGHT A NEW GUITAR AND WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.  THE PRICE IS GREAT AND IT WORKS!  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STAND
1036,118,4.0,Simply the best picks ever for Bass.  Recommended by Eric Friedman on a post and Im glad I followed the recommendation.  Cost Twice as much as Tortex picks so I use these Dunlop picks for gigs and rehearsal and use the cheap-o picks for my finger exercises
297,118,4.0,"I love these picks.  They last a long, long time and are surprisingly easy to grip.  Currently my go to picks"
1156,118,4.0,"These pick have a permanent, fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material. It wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone. In fact, I found it increases speed. These are perfect for a fast-paced style of picking. The tone is bright and snappy!Good quality material ensures I won't be needing another set for a long time!"
1101,118,4.0,"I really dig these.  I have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks, and the worst thing is that when I drop them, they are impossible to find on my beige carpet.  The one I'm using has barely worn with at least 10 hours of playing on it.The size of the pick is the same as normal, it is just more tapered.  I tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it, but it was a little to much work as I dipped it too far into the strings, so I reverted back to a wider gator grip 1.14, which works better with the bigger strings. I am still searching for the world's perfect all-purpose pick. This works until then"
101,118,3.0,Nice pic's that work well when you are really jammin on a tune.
725,52,4.0,"I like this product. The screen is big and easily read. The meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle, the note (sharp or flat) and by the background color going green to red. It takes 2-3 seconds to 'hear' the string but then it locks right in for all notes, even the low E.  It's really easy to use and I'm really happy with it. Its so much better than my Korg CA-1.  The only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel. It takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position. An additional swivel would make it perfect"
847,52,4.0,it tunes my ukuleles! it tunes my guitar! i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch! hooray for this tuner.
887,52,4.0,"The tuning is accurate, the LCD screen is clearly visible, it works great!! I'm not sure about battery life, I haven't gotten there yet."
14,52,3.0,This tuner work well. one of the features is that when its not on one of the notes the full screen is RED. So it easy to quickly tune up.
364,52,3.0,works well but honestly there are better tuners for less money. But all in all works well. Good display and very easy to use.
855,52,1.0,"The technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn't very friendly. Snark rotates to any position I want, but Intellitouch ends up being upside down. It works fine but it's inconvenient."
517,52,4.0,"I have the PT2, which is not backlit, so I bought this one for use in dimly-lit venues. It worked great right out of the box: put in the battery, clipped it onto a standard acoustic guitar headstock, turned it on, and began tuning. The display is big ( 1-1/4"" X 1-1/4 ""), bright even in a bright room, and when the string is in-tune, the backlit background turns from red to green( like Christmas!). I put on a brand new set of strings, and used it to bring each one up to pitch. I found that plucking the string with your finger and then adjusting makes the tuner ""waver"" less, probably because fewer overtones are being produced. All of these type of tuners have some degree of hesitancy when reading the string pitch, moreso on some of the strings than others, but I found that this unit locked in on the signal quickly and gave a very accurate reading. I can use a pick to pluck the string as well and this device, after a very brief pause( less than a 10th of a second), gives me a reading or gives me the green. I don't use any of the other features. I also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument.The only other comment I have about it is that the on button should have been placed on the top of the unit as you clip it onto the headstock, but I just mount the unit over towards one side, and turn it on and off from the bottom.I would highly recommend this for a anyone looking to quickly tune-up a guitar in a noisy, dimly-lit room.Update-August 2012: Replaced the battery after 2 years, with a good quality Sony lithium, and the tuner is still going strong!"
921,52,4.0,"Not my first Intellitouch tuner.  I really like these tuners, they are easy to use and easy to see when tuning up the guitar."
978,52,3.0,"I bought one of these about a year ago and I am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a back-up. Great tuner, just clip it on the headstock, turn it on and tune -- display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so I can even do it without my glasses on. I have used it in noisy environments (other instruments tuning or playing) and it still works, never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or Fender Stratocastor.The ONLY thing that could use improvement is the auto-off function; mine has failed to detect an extended duration of NO audio energy and as such, stayed turned on until it drained the battery. After that, I got in the habit of making SURE I turned it off when not in use. And it uses commonly found 2032 cell batteries so not A big deal to replace (just grab a two-pack of them at the grocery store to keep on hand).Overall, very useful, accurate device and worth a few extra dollars."
1274,463,3.0,"This pad is great for midi VSTi's, Drums, Queuing, and it's got great action! Works great with Ableton, Reason, FL Studio, Cantabile Performer and a whole bunch more DAWs and hosts.The software is a little lame and doesn't always work properly... but you don't really need it that much anyways... so it's whatever.."
632,463,4.0,"After online research, I decided to buy (and found locally) this midi pad to use in Reason 4. Although not confirmed (online) as working with Reason, I was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems. My CPU is Windows 7, but it worked on my MSI netbook also. This unit also worked in Ableton Live (as stated online). I would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs."
864,463,4.0,I own a Native Instruments Maschine Mikro...but find myself using this even more often. You can program it to whatever MIDI values you want. The pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive.
610,463,3.0,"I share most of the same sentiments.The pads are a little stiff, but this works, does the job and is such a small package!Fit's in my Macbook bag -"
674,463,3.0,"I love the pads and the knobs. I used it with Live 8. The software side requires a bit of configuration to work with some software, but ultimately was stable and functional EXCEPT...With my laptop, the USB power supply must be noisy, because the LPD8 will lose its connection and power if you even gently touch one of the cables--however, it works fine if I use a (very cheap!) powered USB hub in between. I suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply. So it may not work in some configurations.Lose a star, because I really love it but in my configuration I am not willing to add a gratuitous USB hub and another wall wart to my road rig. Nice try, akai.[Updated update! 12 jan 013]I have tried a different LPD8 to compare--it does not have the problem! On the systems where my old LPD8 would be flaky, the new LPD8 is rock solid. It appears that I have a broken one with an intermittent problem. If yours has this problem, send it back while it's still in warranty.So that's nice. Now it's really a great product that I can, um, sort of recommend to everyone. However, considering that AKAI ""professional"" has us doing their QC for them, I'd suggest saving the shipping box in case you need to return it for an exchange...at least for a few weeks."
54,386,4.0,"This is a great little keyboard for use with GarageBand on the iPad. GarageBand recognizes it as a controller for the Keyboard, Smart Keyboard, Sampler, Smart Guitar, Smart Bass, and Drums. You can even solo on the Akai keyboard while the Smart Keyboard autoplays an accompaniment! In addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard, this Akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what's built into GarageBand for iPad.Unlike other keyboard controllers I've tried, this one plugs and plays with the iPad--no powered USB hub required. (You do need Apple's Camera connection Kit, of course, to add a USB port to your iPad.) It's not loaded with gimmicks--just the essentials, and the essentials work very well indeed. The keys are 85% of standard width, which is large enough for fumble-free playing. It's lightweight, compact and thus perfectly suited as an iPad accessory."
318,386,3.0,"First of all, don't be ""oversold"" by the ""extraordinary value"" that some reviewers claim this fifty-buck inputting device to be.  Akai is considered a budget-priced version of, and a step down, from Sony, which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself.  But it's the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with Garageband, Band-in-the-Box, Finale, Sibelius, Audacity or a similar program.  The last thing I would do is lug a 50-pound PC or SP Kurzweil model (plus AC power transformer) upstairs to place on an over-crowded desk. Even the 12-pound Yamaha NP-30, with its 76 notes, is awkward to use for this purpose.  Make it nothing longer than a 41-note keyboard, but if you can get one at half the price of the E-Music 41-note, that may be the handiest, most practical device for your needs.Sure, there are alternatives.  You can click at a ""virtual keyboard"" that Garageband makes available for a mouse--but it's slow.  Or you can download a virtual keyboard to your iPad (or iPod) for a couple of bucks, but it's limited to no more than an octave and a ""touch screen"" which, though superior to mouse-clicking, still isn't as satisfying or ""immediate"" as inputting by pressing down on actual, physical keys.This cheaply-made--even ""cheap""--but effective Akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely, especially for someone who's working in congested space.  It's regrettable the company refers to it as a ""performance"" keyboard.  It's nothing of the sort, nor should it be.  That's the reason I initially went with the NP30, only to find that the bi-purpose instrument I had in mind was impractical for either intended use.Take a look at the Korg ""Nano"" piano, and if you're a pianist, you'll immediately see the superiority of the Akai.  But be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the Akai or the E-Music, or you'll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name ""Performance.""  This Akai model looks and feels like a kindergartner's ten-dollar toy, but it's the best compromise I've been able to turn up for my crowded work area."
1158,386,3.0,"I got this and it works well apart from the fact you have to really bang down on the keys, Im hoping over time they will be easier to press"
1064,115,3.0,This is great for those who already own strap locks and just want to gear up the rest of your collection.  no sense spending alot of money on hardware you wont use.  the price was ok.
593,115,4.0,"Once you install a full Dunlop Strap Lock on a guitar and strap, that strap becomes unusable on any guitar that isn't equipped with Dunlop buttons.  Since I only use about 3 straps but have more than 3 guitars, it didn't make much sense to buy full strap locks.  My only concern when I ordered these buttons was that they might not be exactly like the Dunlops and not securely keep the guitar and strap connected.These buttons look and act exactly like the ones that come with a full set of strap locks.  After testing a set, I have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars.  The side benefit is that they are fully functional when used with a guitar strap that is not equipped with the Dunlop locks."
1352,115,4.0,"Looks nice, hardware is good, and it works great on that extra guitar you might have without the need to buy the whole set. Now I have one strap and can swap guitars fast and not worry about dropping my guitar!"
1226,215,4.0,"After lots of researching I finally decided to buy this Zoom pedal, so far it has worked great, has all the features mentioned, lots of great options, also a great guitar tuner. For those doubting, you actually can just plug your headphones in the output jack and practice without an amp, which was an amazing bonus for me since I've yet to buy my amp. 5 starts, totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal!"
975,215,4.0,As usual an excellent Zoom product.Adds to my playing. Just love this thing. Not too difficult to get the hang of. Even for me.
1166,215,2.0,The effects are good but the controls and setups are clumsy and kind of annoying and after a while I just couldn't live with it.
1288,215,4.0,I got this in the mail a week ago and have played with it constantly.there is so much in this little box! i was just interested in the drum tracks in it when i bought it but i have since stopped using all of my other effects and just used this! i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar.
1035,215,4.0,"Just got this. It is my first pedal of any sort. It has many tones and a library of other settings I can play with. I just plug in my headphones and I am off in my own world when I play. I can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever I want, or at least get close to what I want. I see myself using this for a good while before I need to upgrade. This also came with an AC adapter, even though the box said it didn't."
206,40,4.0,Comfortable and very nice fabric!! love it!! =) looks awesome with my white jackson! and u can also adjust it to your body =)
32,40,3.0,"its just a basick thin leather strap, my only problem with it is it could be longer my bass sits to high with this strap set at its longest setting"
212,40,4.0,Great strap for the price. Absolutely no complaints/issues at all. Light weight but sturdy. I was able to put strap locks on this strap with no issues and it works great. Comfortable as well.
859,40,2.0,It does the job but it is a little low on the quality side.  Surprisingly it is not that stiff; not surprisingly I think that has to do with the quality/thickness of the leather.  I don't know if I'm slower than the usual folk but it took awhile for me to learn to adjust it; you have to remove the &#34;buckle&#34; strap to readjust the strap to length.Bottom line?  It works and I feel comfortable with it supporting my axe.
1170,40,2.0,"But dont let that deter you. That just means it will break-in that much more quickly. My favorite strap is not padded in any way, like this strap, but a little wider. I use this on a Telecaster and it looks nice and matches well with the color scheme of the guitar. I hooked a couple4pcs Round Head Strap Locks Black for Guitar Schaller-styleon it and away we went. The strap is made in Canada from decent quality leather(not bonded) and the gold Fender logo is understated, yet classy. It's a classic strap from Fender. What else is there to say?"
879,40,4.0,Not much to say about a plain leather strap except that it's what I wanted and serves me well with the Fender guitar it's strapped to.
569,40,2.0,Very nice quality of leather. It's just a little bit short for my taste. The guitar rested too high for my liking. With some creative engineering I was able to get it to the length I needed.
1023,40,4.0,Very nice guitar strap. I bought it for my ukulele and it works fine. Good leather and believe it or not made in Canada not China! I would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case Ukuleles. Good value! Great seller and fast delivery. Thanks Amazon for a great product!
429,40,3.0,"Plain leather. Looks good and has the Fender logo prominent. No padding, which may be a bit of a problem if you are playing long hours. I use it on a black and white Stratocaster and am happy with it."
807,40,3.0,"This strap works fine for my acoustic using the leather laces to tie around the neck of the guitar.  I didn't like it so much for my electric guitar, because I was nervous that it would come loose, since the leather &#34;buttonholes' are somewhat wimpy.  If you have a heavy electric guitar, I recommend that you buy a locking guitar strap or something with thicker leather.  It would have been better if it had a felt backing, or at least an adjustable pad."
309,40,4.0,This is a nice strap.  It feels really durable.  I like the black side and the soft leather side.  It feels good around my shoulders
216,136,2.0,"The Pyle-Pro PMKS8 mic stand is good for someone looking to buy on a budget. It's fairly solid, heavy enough to hold itself down, and is flexible enough to position the mic how you need it.There are a few issues, however. The metal neck is difficult to tighten onto its base without causing the microphone to be crooked. This means you have to choose between having a straight forward mic and having a mic which doesn't swivel around on its base. The mic holder has the same issue.I would not use this mic stand for an event where it's plainly visible to an audience. It is simply too difficult to position it to look good on camera.I would use this mic stand for personal voice recording an communication. It's great for a desk or a small recording studio."
1055,136,4.0,"Perfect for my obscure use.I discarded the mic clip (or more so, added it to my collection,) and attached a RAM mount to the gooseneck. Now I have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post. What to do with it? I use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights. No more holding a little phone-sized thing up to my face for hours on end. This stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision."
1351,136,3.0,"It's always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place. Promblem resolved, by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place. The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer, about three inches would be great. But otherwise a wise and good purchase."
436,306,4.0,"I ordered this tuner so I could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag.  It's worked fine.  I've used it to tune a ukelele, a bass, and a guitar, and it works fine on all counts.  I have no complaints about it."
725,306,3.0,This is a good item and has served me well.  However I just upgraded to an Intellitouch PT10 for a bit more money and its a much more convenient and really easy to use.  The Korg runs off of ambient sound and gets interference from background noise while the Intellitouch is a clip on and uses vibration to 'hear' the note.
271,306,4.0,Easy to use and accurate. Only issue in tuning Drop d or b on a 5 - String bass... it takes longer to find the sweet spot to tune it. It tends to fall off quickly on low notes. Microphone works well for acoustic guitars.
411,306,4.0,"I have a lot of guitar tuners in the house. I've had few handheld units, some apps on my phone, the Korg Pitch Black, some Fender thing, the Boss TU-3, and the TC Electronic Polytune. I can say that the only tuner that I prefer over this one is the Pitch Black. This little CA1 is actually faster and better than the TU-3 by a hair, and absolutely kills the Polytune in speed and accuracy. Korg really knows how to build their tuners, and this one is a truly great one. Works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric, and also does a fine job on basses, too. I don't know if it's accurate enough for a piano, but it is what it is."
463,306,4.0,This is a nice tuner that works great. nice part is it works on ALL stringed instrument. I will tell you my 1st one did go belly up but Korg's awesome warranty covered it and my 2nd one works great. This is the tuner you want!
778,236,3.0,"I've got a couple of these and for the most part I'm very satisfied. On the Mandy, absolutely no problems. On guitars it sometimes doesn't register on the low E. Usually, moving around helps."
13,236,4.0,"I love thes, I keep buying them for every instrument I have, so I am never with out it..."
1015,236,4.0,I already owned two of these Tuners previously & purchased these for friends. They are great for jamming with friends & are so user friendly & accurate. What is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze. I love mine & so do my friends. In my opinion for the price they are hard to beat.
317,236,4.0,I have two of them.  One in the guitar case holding my Martin HD28 and the other in the case of my Blueridge flattop.  Just clip it on about the nut and tune away.  Pickers playing next to me don't interfere with me tuning.Works great!
925,236,3.0,"I have owned just about every tuner made.  They all had pluses and minuses.  I like this one a lot.  It is my tuner of choice right now.  The backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate.  It is also small, which I appreciate.  For this price ($15) you simply can't go wrong."
850,236,4.0,"This neat little tuner has it all.  It is cheap to buy at Amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning.  Unlike some of my tuners, this one picks up all the notes easily and gives a smooth and accurate reading.  I love the way it folds flat so I can get my instruments in the case with it still clamped on.  I keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times.  There is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it.  It's a must have.  It was only about $15 at Amazon and worth many times that amount."
557,236,4.0,"This thing is a little jewel. I have a jazz guitarr&oacute;n, i.e., a modified Mexican Mariachi guitarr&oacute;n that is custom strung down to the third E below middle C, which is E1 at 41.2 Hz. This little tuner does the job. It works clipped onto the head, and on the bridge also, but a guitarr&oacute;n bridge is a bit wide for it, so clipped directly onto the lower edge of the sound hole, i.e., near the the most treble-sounding string. There it works perfectly and consistently even on that lowest E and it's entirely out of the way since my right hand is coming at the strings from near the bass-most string.Bold_strummer mentions that it buzzed on his classical guitar, and initially I found the same problem, BUT it turned out NOT to be the tuner's fault, but mine. After tuning, I had gotten into the habit of turning it face down against the wood of my instrument. When I did that it made just enough contact with the surface of my instrument to create a buzz. It took me two weeks to figure out what was making the buzz since the noise was coming directly out of the sound hole even though I had the tuner clipped to the head at the time. When I realized it was the turner, all I had to do was NOT turn it down against the instrument when I wasn't using it. Ever since then, no buzz. Brilliant, huh?  c|:-?Another reviewer's idea about getting two of these so as to keep a spare packed in your gig bag is a great one. At this price, why not? This is a great little item."
586,236,4.0,"This tuner has a bright backlight , a padded clip,it rotates, pivots, does flats, and  calibration from 440Hz to 438Hz. Simple to use. Runs on one CR 2032 pancake battery(included). What's not to like. 5 stars all the way. I have 4 others in different cases and one on my work bench. They have been very dependable and easy on batteries. This one goes in a case for a tele copy, that I just finished.Additional Edit. 03/20/2013-This particular unit does not respond a quickly as other identical tuners that I have. I is accurate, just doesn't respond to the string a fast. I still give it 5 stars"
327,236,4.0,"The Intelli IMT-500--The tuner that killed the Intellitouch!There are scores of chromatic tuners on the market.  Most work by using a small built-in microphone that picks up sound waves.  In order to be used effectively, the tuning space must be relatively quiet.  Many of these tuners have input jacks that allow electric guitars to be connected directly and tuned by the electronic signal they produce. A bunch of years ago a variety of clip-on-microphones began to be marketed.  The microphone could be clipped to any instrument and its cord attach to an electronic tuner.  Now, anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise.Then, the Intellitouch tuner hit the market.  The entire tuner clipped onto the instrument.  One could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment.  There was no cord to deal with and the instrument could stay clipped to the headstock or quickly removed and slid into a pocket or case.  Talk about convenience.  Jams and festivals (bluegrass, folk, whatever) became seas of Intellitouch tuners.Intellitouch owned the market even though there were so many situations where they did not work well. In particular, they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars. The more overtones an instrument produces, the worse the tuner behaves. The bass string of a Martin rosewood dreadnought was near impossible to tune without using one of the many workarounds that owners developed.  So, it was very much a love-hate relationship.  The shortcomings were huge, but the convenience meant that they were tolerated.Then, came the Intelli.  It was an Intellitouch that worked, if not perfectly, then a whole lot better.  The amazing thing is that the switch from Intellitouch to Intelli wasn't gradual.  Within six months of its introduction, jams and festivals became seas of Intelli tuners.  People were throwing their Intellitouches into drawers (if they weren't lucky enough to find a die hard holdout willing to buy one second-hand) to get the Intelli.  That's a considerable investment to abandon.  But, why not?  The Intelli is half the price of the Intellitouch and works a whole lot better.  They are so inexpensive that it's easy to justify getting one for the practice area and one for the case so that you don't have to worry about forgetting to pack it.Anyone who will ever have to tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment will quickly find this tuner indispensable.  And it works darn well in a quiet environment, too!Highly recommended!"
1284,236,3.0,"I only have used this tuner on classical guitars (the ones with nylon strings).  I teach classical guitar and have had the opportunity to use it on many different classical guitars of varying quality.  It has tuned them all very well.  A great advantage I've found using this tuner (Tune Tech TT500) verses tuners which use a microphone, is that I can now talk with my students while tuning and no longer have to ask them to please be quiet while I tune their guitars.  Kids especially like to talk and now I can fully engage in conversation with them while tuning their guitars.  The only problem I've noticed, and thus only 4 stars, is that I usually have to begin tuning with any string other than the low E string.  For some reason, the tuner seems to have trouble sensing the low E vibrations and the needle will not move.  This problem has always resolved itself when I tune another string and then tune the low E.PROS:1.  Pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2.  Ambient noise does not disturb tuning sensor3.  Small and compact4.  Swivel head for ease of viewing the screen.5.  The screen is very bright and is also easily seen in direct sunlight.6.  Rubber feet on clamp will not scratch guitar7.  Clamp is strong and will open wide but easy to squeeze open with fingers.8.  Being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning EADGBE.  It's tuning range is 12 note. A2 - B7.9.  Will automatically turn itself off after 3 minutes of non-use.CONS:1.  Delay on tuning low E string2.  Buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string, B.3.  Plastic on screen scratches easilyI don't yet know how long the button battery will last or how much battery replacements cost.  I will update this review when I have that information.  But for now, I am very pleased with this tuner.  I have owned many electronic tuners and this one so far beats them all.  I have also used it to tune my guitarlele and it tunes it darn near perfectly!  Great chromatic tuner at a great price - I love it!"
933,236,4.0,"I'm taking my KORG CA-30, which has no backlight, slow reset time, and a ridiculous ""stand"" feature - put a business card in the slot in the back, and try to find a level surface for it to stand upon - and putting it in my sock drawer with my decades old guitar pitch pipe. Also going in there is my Intellitouch tuner, which drives me nuts with the arrows and does not fit securely on my fiddle.For my fiddle, mandolin and guitar, I'll use my just received Intelli IMT-500 which is very compact (great for fiddle/mando cases), which has an outstanding backlight, superb accuracy and quick resetting.The Intelli, in its own manufacturers box (which has no shock-absorbing material),was placed in a larger shipping box by the distributor/seller ""The Instrument Store"", without any shock-absorbing material, leaving the Intelli, a very sensitive electronic metering device,subject to vibration and shock during the long trip down the east coast.It would be good for Amazon to teach sellers the basics of proper packing for shipping.It's not rocket science."
1102,236,4.0,This is the second tuner I have bought like this. I got it because I need a second tuner. They are very good tuners and I highly recomend any tuners this company makes.
58,236,4.0,"i recently bought this one for myself but i gave it to my praise team leader. when he do turning his accoustic guitar while other players make sound, he always pull cable to connect the guitar and tunner. so i gave this to him to save some time. first he doubt that it would work just like other tunner, after he tried he was very pleased with the accuracy and convinience that he can tune his accoustic guitar while other players are playing. now it's time to treat myself with this gift, so i don't have to do what my leader did during band practice. i also want to mention that this product was made in korea not china~~! it's very rare thing to see now a days."
801,236,4.0,"I use this all the time for acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin, as well as an autoharp and my daughter's fiddle. I'll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case (wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard). This works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused. For my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open G even if it's too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well. I've used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job.Nobody really gets excited about tuners, but I've been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that I know of when I started out. If you wanted to tune and didn't have a 1/4"" input, good luck."
310,4,1.0,"Bought this rosin to see how I would like it.  I have a very light hand on the bow, so I like a rosin that is on the aggressive side.  This is not.  Since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error."
666,4,4.0,"Jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow.  It hardly generates any dust, and gives the bow that extra grab.  The only problem is that the effect wears off quickly.  I use it in combination with Motrya Gold."
236,4,4.0,What can you say about Rosin?  This rosin seems to be better than the cheapo kind I had and so I feel it is worth the extra money.
935,4,4.0,"I have tried several rosins for my violin.  Of all of them, I especially like L'Opera Jade.  It leaves very little rosin dust on the violin.  Yet it gives you the tone quality you are looking for."
9,4,4.0,Very good rosin and does exactly what is described.  A nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows.  No need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity.
961,388,4.0,Very nice product and fits well and good quality. It's held up to my daughters abuse and recommend to everyone.
1151,388,4.0,"I am not an avid player but it fits good and for the price you can not beat it.  I thought it would not be as good but wow my surprise to it and the fit I have a 4/4 Violin I think handed down from my ggggrandfather the violin is so old can hardly tell what kind it is someone once told me it was one of those stratovariouses tempted to throw it out a couple of times but it is sentimental since it came from and handed down through the family, should just pitch the thing but now I do have a nice shoulder comforter.  Will definitely keep the shoulder thing even if I do pitch the violin for a nice shiney new one."
372,388,4.0,"This shoulder rest is sturdy and remarkably easy to install on the fiddle. No adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument's size (3/4 or 4/4 -- arrived set for 4/4). It simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back, and the rubber feet keep it in place. Good value for the price."
1014,388,1.0,"This does work as described.  It arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out.  The reason I only gave it two stars however is because I find it so uncomfortable!  Its quite hard on your collarbone.  I have added foam to it and now it works well, but I suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place."
885,388,4.0,"Everest EZ Series Shoulder Rest for 4/4 Violin is very good deal, if you are learning to play a violin.It helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time."
433,388,3.0,I didn't use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable. But is a well made product if you use it for what it's for.
399,388,4.0,"I am extremely happy with this product. I own several shoulder rests, and this quickly became my favorite and stays on my favorite violin. I have no problem whatsoever keeping it on the violin as long as it's in the proper position. The adjustability is a key factor, and I can turn one side low and the other side higher for a highly customized fit. The padding is also excellent and comfortable. A top-quality product."
296,150,2.0,"I like this pedal.  Its rugged and has a great range of tonal capabilities and rips for hardcore metal.  That being said, the blue LED while cool looking is actually blinding and I found myself placing a finger over it to just see the friggin' knobs for adjustments.  I guess that is a pretty weak complaint but IMO it's an impediment more than an enhancement.  Also the Gate and Scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me... which is not expected at this price point.  A moot point because I am not using the Gate at least as IMO it was &#34;weird&#34; in its Gating execution, sounded kind of like a very rough algorithm is being used instead of a nice smooth curve.  But all in all this thing tears it up in terms of pure shredding tone."
352,150,3.0,"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: The MXR Fullbore Metal is a high-octane distortion suitable for modern metal music. It's 3-band EQ with adjustable Midrange Q gives the MXR FM the ability to model virtually every other distortion out there.WHAT I LIKE about the pedal is that it's small, easy to operate, and doesn't take much time to dial in the tone you want. I play with a Marshall JCM2000 DSL50 going into a 1960A 4x12 using a Les Paul Standard, and it sounds amazing. I love the onboard Marshall JCM-flavored tube distortion, but it is more in line with the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (obviously), and not entirely suitable for modern American metalcore. The MXR Fullbore Metal gets me to where I need to go. This is nice because I can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel, and then tap the Fullbore when I need to play metal.WHAT I DISLIKE is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise, so you have to be careful with the Treble and Mid-Q knobs. However I also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amp's EQ settings as well, so know in advance you'll need to spend a good 15-minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposes.WHAT ABOUT THE EH METAL MUFF? I owned a Metal Muff for years, and this pedal totally blows it away. The big &#34;selling point&#34; about the MM is that it has a Top Boost. Big deal. I wrote a review for the MM on Amazon, but in summary, the Top Boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical. Comparing the Top Boost to the Noise Gate in terms of the big &#34;selling point&#34;, the Fullbore's Noise Gate (which has adjustable sensitivity) to me seems like a MUCH better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to sound.WHAT ABOUT THE BOSS ME-70? I currently own an ME-70, and being totally honest - I think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarist's give each other about multi-effects is because in their mind they think an old-fashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is &#34;real&#34; whereas multi-effects pedals are &#34;fake&#34;. This might be true to some extent, but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains... that at some point the trade-off does indeed make sense. (FYI: Dave Mustaine uses a DigiTech GSP1101 as part of his live rig). #endrant. Anyway, the Boss ME-70 has only a few settings useful onstage, but not so much for recording since in the end, they do sound a tad digital, and the ME-70 compresses your signal. The MXR Fullbore does not compress, and sounds analog, so it wins.FOR RECORDING PURPOSES? I bought this pedal because I wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my Metal EP I'm self-recording. In conjunction with an ADA GCS-3, I created an all-analog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing. Check out the ADA GCS-3 if you can. It's an amazing speaker simulator, and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was it's own 1x12 combo amplifier. Anyway, through the GCS-3, the Fullbore basically sounds like a Mesa-Boogie.WHY ONLY 4 STARS? The Fullbore isn't for everybody, it isn't for every guitar, or every amp, but by itself, it's really friggin good. I suppose if it had a 10-band EQ and a 12AX7 preamp circuit, it would be &#34;the best metal pedal&#34;, but for a small piece of gear, it's probably the best analog distortion on the market."
759,150,1.0,This pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need. I would personally recommend the Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price.
176,150,4.0,"Tis pedal really did for me what I wanted which was kick my little combo in the butt. Hard rock and heavy metal, classic metal is where it shines. I don't mess with the noise gate so I can't really comment on that. but everything else is first rate"
258,150,4.0,"This peddle works great! I looked at many products for, just the right distortion and this one just topped them all. So glad I went with the M116"
707,150,4.0,"A lot of people like the Metal Muff over this and say you can dial in more distortion sounds. Well I have both. The Muff is good for various tones, but the MXR gives you that all out full metal tone. Having the built in gate is also nice and it works! The Muff is a lot more noisy. But I like em both. I just use them for different tones. If you want that full out metal tone, get this, trust me ;)"
511,323,4.0,"This Tascam ""US-100 USB Audio Interface"" is exactly what I was looking for to record from our wireless mic with XLR outputs, directly to my PC video editing software. We professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for ""voice over"" work on existing footage. Before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the PC, so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio. Here are my observations:+ Plug and Play; connected to my PC via USB and was instantly recognized+ USB Powered; no external power needed, a big plus when using my laptop+ Good Sound; clean and clear input+ Multiple Inputs; XLR, 1/4 Mic, RCA stereo line, and ""Hi-Z"" GuitarMisc:- XLR input is not powered (not a problem for us)- Includes ""Audacity"" software, but we did not need to load itHighly Recommended!CFH"
727,323,4.0,"Does it's job extremely well, produces high quality audio and is fantastic for recording your microphone or guitar or what have you without any fuzz or latency. It's built like a tank, and it's nice and solid. This interface is an amazing piece of beginner kit that will not disappoint."
607,323,2.0,"I won't recommend this to anyone, i actually used this one as a sound card, since doesn't work good for recording.spend some more money if you want something good."
472,323,3.0,"The US-100 works fine for my needs: rough and ready audio tracking with 32-bit Cubase 5 on 64-bit Windows 7. My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration (no mixer, non-phantom power mics, headphone monitoring).If you're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs, you'll need a separate mixer and/or standalone phantom supply. From the mixer you can cable to the US-100's line input via RCA jacks on the back.There were a couple of hiccups during setup, but I don't blame the device. It uses stock O/S drivers that loaded right up. The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista, but it's accurate and you'll manage with Win7. On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers (I have Realtek onboard and 2.1 desktop speakers).I'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I/O busses. Once configured however, it's been solid.I'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations.On an XP machine, changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW. On Win7, once I unplug the US-100, the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers. If I plug the US-100 back in, the settings revert again - very reliable. Even better, if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI, the software detects the change and I don't have to reconfigure connections or busses. That may be a function of Cubase, so again it pays to research your particular software.While the US-100 is connected, you'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks. This is where the balance control is very helpful. It's not a pan, it's a center position gain mixing the computer's output (from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds) with direct monitoring of your input signal. Very simple to use for overdubbing. Some people may prefer a hard left/right pan while overdubbing: I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature.If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done, there are a number ways to go: 1) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW. 2) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in.While using the headphone jack, the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa. Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output, but I can live without it.Again, the US-100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities. You can't rely on the product description or packaging to answer that. Fortunately there's enough user-information out there for just about any setup it shouldn't be difficult to track down."
576,323,4.0,"although the quality is obviously not that of a studio, this guy serves it's purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it. i use it when i mess around in garageband, and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment. it's also very easy to use, and the USB cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer. plus, you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus."
461,323,4.0,"got this to run instruments into my comp to use with sony acid, and this works well. I had problems with the sony acid (latency, boo) and while I downloaded an asio program to cut the latency, I don't use it really now, but is good to have when and if I use the sony for recording and not just mixing. the stereo sound on this is great, like true guitar stereo."
158,323,1.0,it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs. It works as a beginner tool but only that. mono only.
445,323,2.0,"I'm sick of protools and I wanted to find something cheap and easy until I could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase.  This unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so I went for it.I'm using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick.  The problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input.  I've tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn't external to the unit.  I even tested the exact same mic + cable input into my MBox with protools and got a clean recording.  I actually like this unit's ""tone"" better than the mbox - it seems more transparent.  If not for the hum, it would get 5 stars.Unfortunately, hum is a pretty big problem.  The hum isn't loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks.  If you start layering, though, you can quickly be overtaken by white noise.  I even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem.So, it works for rough stuff for your own use but I wouldn't use it for anything you plan on passing around much."
67,323,1.0,"This was my first foray into home recording  and it comes with Audacityfor free.  Free is free, and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction .  The interface is noisy, and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc.  Sent it back after one day."
210,88,3.0,"Well, I don't really know what else to say.. I ordered them for the guitar, Though I won't be using them for the banjo. (I prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo)The thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly, and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put. They feel kind of alien right now, as it's the first time I've ever wore finger picks, but I'll get used to them eventually :P."
1076,88,4.0,"I just started playing banjo and did not want to wrap up tons of money in supplies. This was a perfect ""kit"" if you will giving you everything you need to start at a great price."
242,88,3.0,"There is no doubt about it, National fingerpicks are pretty much the standard.  The metal fingerpicks are rock solid, sturdy-gauge steel.  The plastic thumbpicks match tone very well.  And, note that unlike what you may read in another review, they are adjustable.  You just need to heat them up in some hot water and bend to fit.  On my resonator, these provide a full, loud sound.  The only reasons that for me these don't rate 5 stars are that (1) the Pro-Pick F Tone fingerpicks I usually use provide much more of a sense of feel, and (2) the National fingerpicks have a tendency to be a little noisier than the Pro-Picks on the guitar's unwound strings.  Even though I like the National metal fingerpicks much better than plastic fingerpicks I've used, and even though they produce more fullness than the Pro-Picks, for me the sense of feel that I get from the open-finger design of the Pro-Picks trumps volume.  This is important to keep in mind for players whose only fingerpicking experience is with fingers alone.  Players who are already used to metal or plastic fingerpicks should give the National picks strong consideration.  They are solid, sound great, and this packaging of them is excellent!  By the way, the bonus pick is cute (and will go in my logo pick collection), but it's a very thin gauge to be useful to me on anything other than electric guitar."
883,88,4.0,I just started learning the banjo and the picks are worth it. They really help me out and they are a cheap price.
107,88,3.0,"This hand full of picks saves your fingernails, they are not the best, but easy to fit to the fingertips though the thumb picks that came are not the size I am used to."
1081,626,4.0,"Nice accessory, hold plenty of sticks, and the angle makes it easier to get to them quickly."
255,626,4.0,Sticks are well organized and always in reach.  This is a must-have item for drummers and the well-organized.  It fits the set perfectly and is quite practical.

139,732,4.0,"Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No. But on a budget this mic is AMAZING. The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.If you want to upgrade from a headset, cheap mic, Blue Yeti, or AT-2020; buy this mic and an audio interface. You won't regret it."
888,732,4.0,"I compared this to a C1 which is pretty good for half the price.  I also tried two MXLs.  One V63.  This is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much.  I noticed the difference on guitar.  On vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you.  But I realized that it's normal and the other mike just didn't pick stuff up which is worse.  The MXL v67g sounded warm on vocals and not too bad on guitar but if you got too close it gave you this fake low voice and that's just like taking the AT2035 signal and modifying it after you've recorded it.  Besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me.  I tried the CAD M179.  That did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids.  I heard the AT2020 wasn't as good as the AT2035 so I went for it.  And it's more than the switches difference which I don't use anyway.  I didn't like the switches on the CAD M179 either.  It's confusing and I do gain or filter in my DAW.  I considered the NT-1 but at 80 bucks more than the 2035 it seemed like they were very similar.  At the end I'm satisfied with the 2035.  It's a work horse and costs a fraction of the more popular studio amps that have only a subtle difference to me.  I have been staying away from AT products because I didn't like the headphones compared to Sony's.  But this time I caved in because I don't see anything that competes at my price range.  For me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same.  I can record my acoustic or electric guitar out of the cab or sing in it.  My challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room.  I've removed the door on my closet, put a shower curtain with a down comforter on it and record in there.  Ridiculous setup but I've save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that.  For most vocals recording I don't use the closet.  Just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise.  So if things don't change this is my choice for best vocal and instrument microphone in the 100-250 price range.  Nice solid construction and vibration mount included.  It's rugged and I like it."
1225,732,4.0,"The best deal for recording beginners. This mic can handle anything from vocal, guitar, drum, to all the other instruments.It's definitely flat and natural sounding, which I like. Just be aware it comes with a plastic shock mount, not a metal one like the AT2020 comes with. However, it's usable."
1426,732,4.0,"I write and record my own music.  I use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar.  I replaced the cable that came with it with a Mogami and it sounds great.  Crystal clear and it doesn't color the recordings.  It will pick up ambient noise from the front, but that's to be expected.  It does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back.  Be sure to get a pop filter to go with it."
1115,732,3.0,"what part u dont likeyo u  can use eq to wash it a bit awayit is quite good...CAN BE QUITE SIBILANCE PRONE, so beware...ehso for the priceHighly recommended...in these price ranges..stick to known brandslike shure, ev, at, etc...then come the newbies,a few models from mxl, etc etc...have fun"
265,732,4.0,"I've been in professional broadcast studios that don't have mics as nice as this one. Good flat response, but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you don't like to EQ after the fact. Sounds like a million bucks."
730,732,4.0,"This this is great.  It is my first condenser mic, and at $149 it is a steal.I've always used Shure or Heil mics that cost over $250... This mic in a studio application smokes them.  It is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it.  But if you really want to be amazed, do an A/B comparison.This mic has convinced me to  purchase the Audio-Technica  AT4040.  Cant wait to get it and I will review it also."
919,732,4.0,"Enjoyable mic, has a decent frequency response range, nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise. I usually have to do some post-processing on vocals, but in the genres I work in that's not exactly a rare thing. Either way sounds way better than I would expect for a mic at this price. Haven't tried it for drums or guitar *yet* but I'm impressed with it's ability to accurately capture vocals. While it doesn't have the warmth that some mics relay, I prefer it that way. It leaves a really clean, if slightly cold/flat feeling, that can then be warmed up in post production nicely.Good value for the sound, no complaints with the shock mount. Though make sure to be cautious with your mic placement, get a pop filter, and if you have a room with lots of ambient noise don't be shocked if it picks some of it up. All in all a good deal."
98,243,4.0,"I've been nothing but pleased with this pedal so far. I use it boost my jazz bass to the same volume level as my precision.  It does the job perfectly.  The LED is REALLY bright, which for me is a good thing, but others might find distracting.  Also, it would convenient if there were external switches instead of internal dip switches for varying the settings, but in such a small footprint, there are bound to be tradeoffs. I'd buy this again for sure."
985,243,4.0,"A booster makes your signal louder!  That has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like MXR Micro Amp, EHX LPB-1, BBE Boosta Grande, Modtone, etc.  They keep your guitar's original tone, make it louder and when pushed enough, will add a good amount of gain & grit.  But there is something else going on with the Xotic EP Booster.  Yes, it also makes the signal louder, adds gain or a little dirt, but also makes your overall sound bigger & wider!  Based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like Jimmy Page, Duane Allman, Gary Moore, etc.  This pedal is really small in size, has one knob & the footswitch.  It does have an internal dip switch.  You open up the back of the pedal & choose you own setting.  I leave at the classic setting, turn the gain knob at 9 or 10 o'clock & leave it on all the time.  I tried it before & after my OD pedals and my personal preference is ""after""!  Being in front of the amp, it didn't do much when I tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp.  I put it in the FX loop & it boosted the signal alright but I didn't like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my OD pedals.This is one pedal that will stay on my board.  I doesn't take up much space, built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better.  It does one job only but it does it so well!"
861,243,4.0,"Look no further this is the best Booster with an internal EQ, what else can you ask for? Go for it, if you need a versatile small booster, it comes with a 9v battery"
396,243,3.0,"Indeed, this little blue-lighted wonder will make you famous. Not unlike the &#34;Three Wolf Moon&#34; shirt, this little pedal will get you the ladies (or if you're a lady, it will likely get you the guys). Either way, it gets you what you want! On top of that, it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of &#34;oomph&#34;. In particular, I find it helpful when I'm running a lower output guitar through a long cable. Did I mention it has a blue light? The only downside is that you have to open up the back (with a screwdriver, so put that on your shopping list if you don't have one) to adjust the little switches that chance the tone."
284,243,4.0,"As soon as I kicked this pedal in at unity gain, the difference was obvious.  I am most please at the boost feature which is amazing for one important reason: the noise level is nothing like what I was expecting.  I keep my amp clean & I found that even at around 11:00 the noise was still almost unnoticeable. At noon & up it's there until you start playing but even then, it's still much lower that the guitar. There's also an almost expander/exciter FX going on which is very noticeable, especially when I compared it to my BBE FREQ BOOST. First rate pedal!"
844,243,4.0,It just arrived to day and seems well-build.  Haven't tried it yet.
1297,243,4.0,"My always on pedal. This pedal's amazing. You really should try it yourself to understand. I'm using a Fender Jaguar, this thing is married to it. I'm serious, try it before you die!"
1119,243,2.0,"I have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviews.I already have an MXR line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp. This serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run. Replacing that with the EP booster did not have a significant impact on my tone. Yes it was a little colored, but not too different from the line booster.If at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run, yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal. I didn't find it magical though, because I've always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different.I am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos."
1364,641,4.0,"Despite the sensitivity of a compressor microphone I still use this to record heavy metal guitar. Only thing is I use a small amplifier, only a fifteen watt Line 6 spider 3. I can keep the volume down so the neighbors do not hear my guitar. Anyways, the only thing is when I use recording software I have to not record the guitar too loud. And oh my it records good! Now I no longer have to record straight into my computer where I get all loud over compressed guitar sound. I can record with drum loops and with the microphone it goes into the computer and I no longer get the loud over-compressed guitar sound that I never like very much. Glad I purchased this. For those who would try this for guitar, remember this is a sensitive compressor mic and you will get a very loud recording you will not like. So you just record as quietly as you can. This mic is sensitive! But oh boy I like it! Man I can play for hours and the guitar goes way better with the drum loops. And as I said before the amp is not gonna be loud enough to bother the neighbors. A good buy well worth the price."
755,641,2.0,"now it doesn't work(same day i got it). In my control panel the mic is there but it doesn't pick up any sound. Followed all the instructions, emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been 3-4 days no answer. Maybe i'm being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it... If you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment."
1164,641,4.0,This mic fits my studio need perfectly. It's USB connection works great for my voice overs with great sound and sensitivity. I would recommend one
966,641,1.0,"Im starting a podcast. I blindly lept to buy the blue yeti. I can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this. Great for voice overs. In sound proof studios. The sound quality was good but it picked up WAY TO MUCH ROOM NOISE. The ability to select the 4 recording modes is great. If youll use it. I would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this. However recording a choir or something would work. But I will never do that and neither will you. This microphone only has a usb port. Not XLR. So no hope of expanding. If you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones.Or you can do what I did and get 2 Audio Technica ATR 2100's, 1 Behringer Xenyx 802 dual mic input Mixer, 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti, raidus shock mount, the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand.Now I can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics, or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast.Do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever"
1174,641,4.0,"I am not a sound guy - I just wanted something to plug in and record my practice sessions. This is vastly better than any webcam or communications microphone for recording instruments.The four direction settings are fun, though I find myself using the stereo or cardioid settings the most. The no-delay headphone jack is great. I was impressed the first time I plugged everything in and tried it out - it's nice to hear how my playing sounds from an outside standpoint.Setup was easy, and quick. I have experienced a few times when plugging it in registered it as a recording device, but failed to actually use it. This may be a windows problem, and fixed itself eventually.I am quite happy with the build quality. The base is hefty and wide, planting the mic firmly. The body and buttons are plastic, but solid, they don't feel or look cheap."
139,641,4.0,"After 1.5 years, this microphone has lasted me a VERY long time and has stayed a fantastic microphone. As I am getting more serious with voice over, I am moving to better equipment, but as a starter microphone/ microphone in general: It deserves a nod of approval. Definitely a fantastic purchase, very happy with it!"
740,641,4.0,"I have used many microphones, from  expensive Neumanns, Sennheisers, Sure, AKG to the less expensive Berringer B2 Pro and Sony. I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing, so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons. First is sound quality, all the patterns have a smooth, open sound, the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work, comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure. The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level, which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode, but in that pattern, voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich, plucky and natural. Next is the construction of the mic and stand, from the pictures I was expecting plastic, nope, it is made of very solid metal , except the buttons and switches. Third is the versatility, you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately, but with excellence, try that with a $2,000.00 Neumann! The set up could not be easier, just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip. I only paid $100.00 on Amazon,a true bargain, for what is a top notch piece of gear, where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art. The Yeti also stands up to audio processing, where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under $200.00 show their weaknesses. The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic, it is just too big for all of my other mounts, but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do (I also use a slab of 1/4"" neoprene padding to absorb some table shock), and the Yeti has no real audible self noise. If you want a great microphone at an incredible price, the Blue Yeti is the one for you!Addendum 9-30-2011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved, with the Blue Radius, which I received a week ago from Amazon, which I love. Makes this great, and I mean great microphone even better. I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87, the Sennhieser D421, the Lawson L47, all top notch and very expensive studio mics. The Yeti sounds as good. Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound. I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic, some of the folks are not using this, and I'm sure other mike's correctly to get the best sound. Also the more I use the Yeti, the more seasoned it becomes, in comparison recordings done a year ago, the Yeti seems to get a smoother sound, as time goes by."
800,641,4.0,"This was an excellent purchase.  Beside having a great range of audio pick-up, the mic is so versatile.  Great product!"
868,641,4.0,"Eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion, worked perfectly out of the box, and has been used several times to record choirs and piano. The sound is clear and well-balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around 10 feet."
1067,641,4.0,"The latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device I've yet found: The Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone. Long known for their line of high-end condenser microphones, Blue is increasingly known for their computer-ready USB microphones, like the Snowflake and the Snowball, and the Yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer-ready microphone yet.Advertised as the first fully THX-compliant (a standard devised by Lucasfilms) microphone,  the Yeti is a large (12"" tall on its removable stand), hefty, multi-pattern microphone suitable for recording, podcasting, or any other computer-related audio activity. It features four switchable patterns- omni, carodid, figure eight, and stereo- a built in headphone amplifier, gain control, headpohone volume, and a mute button. For even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard 5/8""microphone stand or boom.And it sounds great, too- even better than their well-regarded Snowball series. I've been using it for recording music practice, building tracks with Audacity on my Windows and linux boxes, and with Apple's GarageBand, and making calls with Skype. The ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus. Up to now I've been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an A/D converters- a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk, but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home. The Yeti has it all in one package. It may not sound quite as good as a multi-thousand dollar condenser microphone and vacuum tube preamp, but for the money it simply can't be beat."
1189,641,4.0,"Yes, you can make perfectly good pod casts and voice overs with this. Trick: treat your room with sound deadening."
318,641,3.0,"I was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate, if not be indistinguishable from, the audio quality of the heavy-duty Shure microphones used at WGTD FM HD.  All the mics that I had previously tried at this price point and lower, including Blue's ""Snow"" line, sounded overly treblish, with pronounced sibilance (listen to the comparison-contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration).  By contrast, the Yeti is rich and resonant, and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter.  Short of spending 4-5 times more, I'm convinced this is the best option in my particular case.At the same time, as a musician without a home studio I seriously doubt I'll make much use of the mic for performance or recording.  As far as performance goes, the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation, upstaging the performer (at least a vocalist with a normal-sized head).  And for traveling purposes, I've found the Sansom Go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer (even though Blue's literature shows the Yeti alongside a laptop).Blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product.  Its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations--perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of Blue's lighter, more compact microphones.  Its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, the volume, gain, and pattern knobs are rather loose, allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement.  The knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball-bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment. There's the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control's circular movement, but it's not at the 12 o'clock position, so it's difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid-point for quick and easy assessment of positioning.In sum, the Yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably-priced mics, and it should prove a useful (not to mention handsome) addition to any home studio.  It's still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior.  It's main competitor on Amazon--the Audio Technica AT2020--is pint-sized compared to the Yeti, and I'll confess I'm still not sure whether I made the best choice (the 2 mics have been alternating in the 1 and 2 slots of best-selling mics on Amazon for 3 months now).  I wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the AT's relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise--however slight--to audio quality.[I experienced initial hesitancy on Yeti's part to make an appearance in the Input and Output panels (in System Preferences) of my iMac. Then I read the instructions, which discourage plugging the mic into a hub. Plugged directly into a USB port on my computer, Yeti immediately sprang into action. My hunch is that a good, powered 4-port hub would be equally effective.]"
1415,641,4.0,"This is the best USB microphone out for under $100 bucks.It's a shame that its been out for a few years now, and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one.  I love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording.  The sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as I have this fairly close to my computer in my office and I can't hear the computer in my recordings.I haven't used this microphone with instruments, as I am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video, and it sounds great.The only thing you have to do it plug it in, and go.  You need no additional drivers to run this microphone in Windows 7. I did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone, but it worked perfectly after that.I just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock-mount - YETI combo pack, as I have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven't used the base that much since arriving at that setup.If you are in the market for an excellent USB microphone,  look no further, you can't get anything better than this for under $100 bucks.  Just make sure you get a pop filter for it, and Yes the BLUE Pop Filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn't.  Just check out my review video for the Blue Pop.Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter"
493,641,3.0,"This is a good quality microphone. The sound quality is good in the various modes, although I have used it primarily in cardioid and stereo modes. It's easy to set up. Under Windows 7, all I had to do is plug it in. The instruction manual hasn't been updated in years and gives instructions for Windows Vista and XP. The instructions for Vista are mostly accurate for Windows 7, but I found that the default settings are better than the recommended settings in the instructions. Also there is no driver supplied by the company. The Microsoft driver will work fine, and there might not be a sonic advantage to making their own driver. But it means that there is no custom control panel and you have to use the more obscure Windows ones. Also the icon for the microphone doesn't match the product, which isn't really a big deal. It's just a matter of attention to detail. The instruction manual is in English and French, but the warranty information is in French in both places. They both say there is a two year warranty and give a phone number in the Los Angeles area. There's a copy of the actual warranty on their website, although it does have terms that violate US law so I have no idea how they handle actual warranty issues.The only real negative I experienced when setting up was that it interfered with my keyboard. I'm using a fairly standard Logitech wireless keyboard, and it experienced a lag, and not all letters showed up when I typed. I unplugged the USB cable for the microphone and things went back to normal. Repeating the process yielded identical results. After rebooting the computer, the problem went away. Hopefully there won't be long term issues.The bottom line is that not a single problem related to the quality of the microphone itself, which works well, is very clear, and is extremely sensitive. It will pick up a whisper from 15 feet away with the same clarity as if I were sitting two feet in front of it. That's with volume settings that work clearly when I really am two feet in front of it. The down side is that it will pick up every stray sound from letting your hand rub your shirt to letting your feet rub the carpet. But those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself."
1381,488,3.0,"So, there are some people who review this as superb, with no noise and just the best thing ever. To be honest, I have no idea where this is coming from. I do get a good amount of noise (static buzz) that makes it difficult to use it when playing your guitar in a more quiet mode. Also, the sustain is not as good as I thought it would be and I had to do a lot of fine-tuning with my amp to find a satisfying setting (works best with some additional reverb setting).That said, for the price, it is pretty good. I do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic. It is what it is, a rather inexpensive compressor that does a pretty good job for that price."
536,488,4.0,"In case you were wondering, this is a clone of the Boss compressor/sustainer.  It does a very good job reproducing the original at a fraction of the cost.  You add noise to your chain with any compressor because that's what they do- they elevate quiet signal and minimize volume spikes to even it all out.  When it is off, this thing had pretty decent bypass but I would not string an entire board together with pedals that are not true bypass because it would suck tone.  The box is plastic, but it is solid ABS plastic and is perfectly adequate.  I've not yet heard of a Behringer stomp box failing because the plastic box crushed when someone stepped on it.  People do like to complain about the battery cover being annoying and I have to say- aren't they all??? Seriously- when you can hook up a daisy chain and not ever have to deal with a dead battery ever again in your life, what are you complaining about?  The knobs are solid, and work just fine.  I own like a dozen of these cheap Behringer pedals and I have never had a problem with any of them.  You get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box."
904,488,4.0,"This Behringer compressor sustainer compare's to the Boss CS-2 the behringer sustaining is excellent and a tone, compression level is very good and all for $25.00 , not putting down the Boss, but for this price you can't go wrong."
578,488,4.0,This is a clone of the boss compressor and works just as well as far as I have been able to tell as the original. being the owner of both I would have to say if you're not too stuck up about brands then I would go with this if you like the boss cs3 but many people say that bosses compressor is not that good I know some compressors do seem to be a little more natural sounding however that is just preference it does what it needs to chicken picking or just crispening up your sound its plastic but nothing is unbreakable so use some sense don't hit it with a hammer or JUMP on it and you'll not break it I've had no problems with behringer but heard great things. The cost is so low anyhow so who cares anyhow.
1169,488,3.0,"The title says it all.  Great performance, sub par construction.  I bought this pedal for the compression and sustain, though, and am very pleased.  I use it for both bass and guitar, and it processes the signals well.  I am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also.  Cheaply made, though.  I removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit.  The removal stopped a terrible clicking noise that would have been audible from the stage floor.  Plastic encasement means the unit will likely suffer noticeable wear and tear throughout its lifetime.  Wish it was better made.  Audio reproduction is great!"
1007,488,4.0,"More likely known as a guitar compensation device, the effect itself it widely used in everything. I have couple few behringer pedals, some complain about plastic housings but a) I don't beat my gear and b) plastic doesn't get rust and corrosion. The build on behringer are tough and fine to me, and the prices make them attainable to all players. The only thing I say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals, gotta spring for power supply plug, if not now, eventually because it'll drive you nuts.Compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just can't not have if that's your thing. The sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build, so even a cheap one can ring like the best.So you got both in one, tailoring will add life to even a dull axe.  Some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you can't do without once you find em."
199,488,4.0,"I've been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now. This pedal completed that task. It's hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect. Very punchy and crisp. You can't go wrong with Behringer pedals. They are plastic though, so they might not hold up under heavy road use, but for home studios they are perfect. Highly recommended."
1377,488,3.0,Noisy as any compressor but after using it I don't wanna go back to not having one for my setup.
575,488,4.0,"There's not much to be said about this pedal: it just works. It's my fourth cheapy Behringer pedal and I have been pleased with every one of them. This pedal is great for tweaking your sound to get it juuuust right. I play punk, blues, and country, and this pedal helps me obtain the entire range of sounds necessary for my various styles. Even on a cheap amp (upgrading to a Marshall next month), this gets the job done. People who complain about the plastic casing are just looking to whine, imo. It's a good solid plastic that holds up well, and if it drops the price to $20 instead of $50, that just makes Behringer effects more accessible than that other brand."
922,488,4.0,"Behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals. I have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer. It is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting. I've had more expensive pedals over the last 25 years of playing, but it's hard to beat the price features and quality of the Behringer pedals."
995,488,3.0,A bargain at the offered price.  Gives you virtually unlimited sustain.  It is a good cheap addition to my effects board.
633,488,3.0,"What more can you ask for at roughly $25.00. This is a very useful guitar compressor. It is a simple compressor, that's it. Easy to understand with responsive controls.I use compressors quite a lot. In my PA rack I have a Yamaha rack compressor and an Alesis rack compressor. In my home studio there are compressors in my 24 track DAW and in my computer I have the T-Racks Deluxe mastering software with several VST classic analog compressors like the Pultec as well as VST optical compressors. I only mention these as a way of saying that I am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them. I have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratios,attack and release points and I have learned to use them sparringly and with care. The Behringer CS400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor. It is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp. In recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working, it's not being used correctly. The Behringer CS400 is quiet, almost transparent (unlike the Behringer DC9 I discuss below). Yes, it is plastic but it's fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years. If you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long time.If money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around $75-$100.00 and up (Keeley,MXR, Digitech, etc.) Unless you go over $100.00 I don't think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle. If your signal path aready has hum and static, this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because that's what compressors do-lower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound. If you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch, this little Behringer CS400 will do it.(Behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the Behringer DC9. It is all metal and attempts to clone the classic MXR pedal. I personally would stay away from this pedal for live use. I bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain. You can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference. I don't use the DC9 when I play live but I like it on my guitar when I record using my VOX VT30 amp. I like it better than the built in compressor on the VT30)."
387,488,3.0,Behringer products are good for the semi-pro.Nothing fancy about the compression; most amp emulators have good compression but lack true sustain at low gain/volume.This is good for getting that extra decibel or more of boost to carry those notes longer.Doesn't sound good playing fast.The CS400 shines with the longest lasting sustain you can get in a $25 pedal.
270,488,2.0,"While the case is made of plastic, the construction is solid and seems very durable. My disappointment is with the sound. I never could dial in a sound that made me feel like it enhanced the sound of my bass. It was just different. I've switched to using the built-in compressor in my Digitech BP90 instead."
268,488,4.0,and nice its like really just wow ! you know ?like awesome and really cool i do i do ido like like love it
139,851,4.0,"Brass Tacks:They are Velour. They fit on the ATH-M50 headphones. That is what I wanted.They are not a perfect fit, as they are MEANT for a slightly larger can, but it's more than snug. Looks good too!(Remember: Because of the material, you WILL notice a slight difference in sound.)"
314,851,4.0,"I don't own the SRH840s, but rather the SRH440s. It was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the 440s in terms of sound and comfort. I didn't believe the sound part, but I bought them because I at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my 440s. When I got them, they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals. They are definitely more comfortable. I don't know what it is, but something about the sound is different and I don't think it's placebo. There seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places I wouldn't expect. I highly recommend this upgrade."
1092,851,4.0,"I have used these pads on numerous non-Shure headphones like the fostex trp50 and the hifiman he-500 and I have to say that these are by far the best , most inexpensive solution to any headphone they will fit.  They ave made the sound quality better on each headset that I have put them on, and they are softer and more comfortable than any other replacement pads I have tried in the price range,  Highly recommended!"
1401,660,4.0,"It's tough to shell $85+ for a pedal that is not an effect, but now that I've had it for a few weeks I'm glad I bought it. Although my guitars pretty much stay in tune, warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while I'm playing them. The Boss TU-3 is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time. When you play in a band, you got to have a pedal tuner and you can't go wrong with Boss."
688,660,4.0,"I wanted an upgrade to my TU-2, which I had for years. This TU-3 is easier to see, and is more precise in it's tunings. I recommend it!"
542,660,4.0,I have this tuner attached to my pedal board and it is fantastic. There are tons of settings and the LEDs are nice and bright for dark stages or bright outdoor venues.Highly recommended
1230,660,4.0,"As with all Boss products, I've been very happy. The tuner is easy to use ... need I say more. I'm from the olden days of the 440 tuning fork for tuning, so this is GREAT!"
176,660,4.0,I've owned many tuners through the years and I keep coming back to this one. buffer mutes when you play and the quality is great for this price point
331,660,4.0,"I know spending this kind of money on a pedal that doesn't even add an effect to your tone sounds pretty crazy, but this is definitely worth it. If you think about it, when your guitar is out of tune, it doesn't matter how perfect every aspect of your playing, equipment, and set-up is; you will still sound bad. So, in a way, this is the most important pedal you can have.This pedal works great as a tuner and very vividly displays how far off you are from being in tune. Works great as a mute switch too, just one click and you've got no sound - perfect for switching guitars and/or just muting all sound.The design is quite sturdy as well, it feels very solid. I definitely recommend this pedal."
164,660,3.0,"It works well 95% of the time but sometimes has a problem with the G string for me. I use it in tandem with a snark tuner and together they're fail safe. (the snark tuner will also get buggy once in a while but together it's so statistically unlikely that I don't worry about it)The stomp tuner also has the benefit of being able to hault the signal, hence why I wouldn't just use a snark tuner."
1418,660,4.0,"The title pretty much says it all. This is such a simple, great tuner. The streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical! Great deal."
1018,660,4.0,"This thing works great!I play out live in clubs and this device is indispensable. Accurate and quick - great for between song quick tuning.It's a Boss pedal - so it is rugged and reliable.I have seen this pedal on the pedal boards of top touring pros, recording artists and session musicians in and around the Dallas and North Texas area. I play locally and regionally in North Texas and see this pedal on almost EVERY guitarist and bassist's boards every night.Great product - well made - worth every penny.** UPDATE **After using this tuner for a month I can say that I made the right decision.Fantastic product that every guitar player needs - period.** ** ** ** ** ** *EDIT 10-23-2012I have purchased another one of these tuners for an alternate pedal board.These really are the best tuners out there - you should get one today!There is no comparison to anything else out there - nothing - I have looked!"
1010,555,4.0,"It works, and it works well.  It easily cuts guitar strings, ukulele strings, etc.  No damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings.  If you change your own strings, this cutter is a must have.  It is very durable, the material is made of high quality metal, and it makes clean cuts.  The rubber grips are comfortable to use, and have red accents (and therefore easy to find).My only minor gripe is that it is spring-loaded to open.  I've cut myself with the blades reaching into the pocket a few times when I first got it.  Thankfully I don't change strings too often.  I also made a little leather pouch for the clipper end, and I put a rubber band around the handles to keep it closed.A must-have for your guitar/bass/ukulele bag.  Highly recommended."
40,555,3.0,"As is the case with all tools, you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter.  It's extremely well-built, and performs its task very well.Pros:- Extremely high quality metal- Comfortable rubber grips- Red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag-of-tricks- Effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringsCons:- Has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage; the tool is spring-loaded to open.  While this may be a plus for some people, I find it less than ideal.Overall, this is an extremely well-made tool for your guitar kit.  If you're a bassist that likes stainless steel strings, you'll appreciate how they cut like butter."
542,555,4.0,This cuts strings with no problems. It doesn't take a lot of pressure to squeeze the handles and it doesn't damage the cutting blades like some wire cutters.Highly recommended for frequent string changes.
1272,555,4.0,Good cutter for guitar strings and will take care of most electrical wire sizes too. Handel is very comfortable too.
1407,555,4.0,"While this is a simple string cutter (something one can buy about anywhere), it is made well and is of excellent quality. Anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool. It is easy to hold and is a good product."
365,555,4.0,"At first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings, but these do work extremely well.  They seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner post.I do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that they're spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed.  That does make storing them a little akward, but again, I think this is the best product out there if you change your own strings.PS - If you are using scissors to clip strings ends, you are crazy - buy these things..."
63,362,4.0,"I had done a fair amount of research on banjos before I bought this. It has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well. Yes there many banjos and some with more frills. There is no indication of where this banjo was made, but the quality is top notch. I am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely. I see no flaws on my banjo. I did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others. I bought mine from [...], the same place it ships if you buy it at Amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy. I also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck, that is not a issue either. While I am expert on banjo I would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either. A keeper for sure."
210,362,4.0,"So, I ordered this to learn to play the banjo, because of the price and good reviews. It was delivered yesterday, and the first thing I noticed was that the neck was loose, and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board. I looked to make sure it wasn't warped or cracked, and it wasn't.So I scoured the internet to find my problem, and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot. So I took the resonator off, and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body, and naturally that scared me, but I tightened the metal rod, and it brought the neck down to the body, and brought the strings down to the perfect height.Now it's a very beautiful instrument, and it sounds pretty good too, Granted, It's not a Gold Tone or what have you, But it sounds at-least like a banjo that costs 2-3x this much. The only thing I would change is the tuning pegs, as they are made out of a cheap plastic, they don't feel like they will break any time soon though, I just prefer metal tuning pegs. (the part that holds the strings is still metal, I'm talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plastic)So, I'm debating on rating it 4 stars or 5 stars.. I'd rate it 4 because of the scare it gave me at first, but I think I'll rate it 5 stars because of it's looks, sound, and price. Yes, the reviews are right guys, don't be skeptical, But be warned that you may have to do a little TLC on it, as I did with the neck. No worries though, Now I'm learning my new favorite instrument. (Also, the strings that came on it are pretty decent, but new strings sound a bit better)"
512,362,4.0,"My banjo arrived a couple days after I ordered it. It tuned up very easily, and for me it holds tune nicely. It has a good ring to it. So far I have only had to replace one string, but that was most probably due to inadvertently letting it sit in front of a forced air heating vent."
110,362,4.0,&#34;Quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations. Great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price. Sounds good and the action is smooth.&#34;
380,362,4.0,"I PURCHESED THIS BANJO FOR MY PERSONAL HOBY AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL INSTRAMENT THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE Playability IS GREAT ALSO, I AM A GUITAR PLAYER FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND I KNOW QUALITY WHEN I SEE IT. FOR THE MONEY YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BANGJO FOR BEGINNERS, OR JUST ONY ONE WHO PLAYS JOHN R"
934,362,4.0,"BOY, WAS I SURPRISED AND PLEASED WHEN THE BANJO ARRIVED AND I TOOK MY FIRST LOOK AT MY NEW PURCHASE!  THE INSTRUMENT IS FAR SUPERIOR THAN I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED FOR THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.THE WORKMANSHIP AND QUALITY OF THE FINISH IS REALLY FINE.  I .RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GOOD VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY.  THE PACKAGE WAS REALLY WELL DON E AND ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME.  I HAVEN'T LEARNED TO PLAY THE BANJO YET, BUT HAVE PLAYED UKULELES, GUITAR, TIPPLE, AND LUTE SO I KNOW A GOOD INSTRUMENT WHEN I SEE IT.."
883,362,4.0,I bought this not knowing what to expect. It sounds just like I hear on tv and it sounds great.
202,362,4.0,"I was disturbed with the price of banjos, until I did some research on the construction of them.  They're not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience.  At least, they wouldn't be able to put together a quality banjo.  But Jameson Guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price.The tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great. I'm a guitar player and I'm excited to explore the different sounds I will be able to get out of this banjo.  It's also very good looking.  I love the neck and the back.  Even the drum.  Quality work was put into this thing.  I'm quite pleased.Now, I just need to get used to playing with 5 strings! :)"
558,362,4.0,"I have been online shopping banjos quite... extensively.  Ebay, Amazon, 3 dozen+ online shops, reviews from multitude of sources, investigating manufacturer home sites, etc.  I did the same for this banjo, and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo, I still felt very comfortable with what little I put together information wise.  And frankly, at this price, it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget (sometimes, you just can't afford 400+ dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand).  Additionally, mine came very well setup from the seller (aside from the inevitable tuning).  And its purty too!  I would also deeply recommendSnark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner... absolutely the best tuner I have ever used and makes the various banjo-tuning schemes a breeze.Be aware, in order to avoid possible confusion, Jameson Guitars is actually a sub-brand of Davison Guitars, so if you order and look at your peg-head and it says Davison (like mine does) and not R.W. Jameson, its the same maker (yes, I examined Davison's home site as well as the Amazon Seller's)."
41,188,4.0,This pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly. It was a good purchase. I recomend it.
411,188,4.0,"I wrote a nasty review of this tuner a while back, blasting its performance compared to its competitors: the Korg Pitch Black and the Boss TU-3. I still own at least of each.Anyway, I have had this tuner for a few years now. Stock this tuner was awful. While attractive and compact, in single note tuning, the needle was not as fast and stable as its competitors, and the polyphonic mode wasn't accurate enough either. Moreover, the display isn't as visible as a Pitch Black or TU-3 in the sunlight. So while this tuner is great if you want something that looks nice and doesn't take up space on the pedal board, stock it just wasn't a truly great tuner.However, that was before a firmware update. After applying the latest updates, the tuner has become very usable. The polyphonic mode is still not quite good enough to rely on 100%, but the single note mode seems just as accurate as any other tuner in its price range now. So now you have a small, attractive tuner w/ true bypass that actually works. So I have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars. Also, given that the price has dropped sharply since I bought the tuner, now it is a much better bang for the buck.So yeah, buy this product with confidence, but if you have purchased it used or if you have an old PolyTune, make sure that the firmware is up to date. Without the update, this tuner was borderline terrible. With the update, it's good enough to be the tuner on my primary stage pedalboard. And in fact, it is, and it has held up to regular practices and gigs."
930,188,2.0,"I found this to be very inaccurate but only on a few strings, so adjustment is not possible. I bought this because of the newer features & I like the strum & see which strings were out function but what good are nice features if the main function of the tuner is inaccurate! It's not a bad tuner, seems well built but unless you play so poorly or loud that tuning precision doesn't matter I'd go with the Korg Pitch Black (which is what I was using in my home studio - well back to what worked!)"
654,188,4.0,"Cool tuner, I have this on my pedal board and it works really well, very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isn't on...."
947,188,3.0,"I like the pedal.  It's totally silent, very bright display, sensitive meter.  In fact, the only complaint I have is that the strum-every-string-at-once thing isn't as useful as you might think.  Not that I ever use it.  I'd buy this product again if I had it to do over again."
83,188,4.0,"This tuner is wonderful. You can tune all strings in same time. It's halpfull in stage, because you don't need to test each string individually."
1171,188,3.0,"I like the tuner and I'm definitely keeping it, but the ""polyphonic"" aspect of it is pretty useless. When you tune using the needle (or LED version of a needle), it will show each string as being in tune. Then when you strum and use the polyphonic mode, it often shows some strings are out! And that's even when I use the neck pick up and strum with my thumb, as the manual says to do. But the tuner works great in the single string mode, and I also like the drop D setting and the easy way to switch between the 2 modes. It also has very cool and easy ways to adjust the 440 Hz pitch, and it is very easy to switch to Eb tunings and other settings. I also like the LED lights and the automatic brightness setting. That is a very cool feature for those folks who still use batteries to power their pedals. The tuner works great, and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting. So buy it, but do it because the price is right and it works great as a tuner in the traditional sense, not because of the polyphonic gimmick. (August 2013 edit as follows) I just found out a feature of this pedal that I definitely do NOT like!! I dislike it so much, I had to edit my review. I wanted to hear how some of my licks sounded in E flat. So I set the tuner to the E flat setting as explained in the manual, then I tried to tune. All the strings kept showing that they were still in standard tuning. It seems as if my drop settings on the tuner were not functioning. I wrote the manufacturer (they did get back to me quickly) and they explained that the drop tuning functions ONLY WORK in polytune mode!! So if you're like me, and you find that polytune doesn't work very well, then basically all this is is a standard needle chromatic tuner that will not tune in any other drop modes! LAME!!"
353,73,4.0,"I finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner. This thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it doesn't suck any of your tone. I haven't used the battery pack, so don't know about battery life. I use a one-spot plug to power it. Another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on. It's very heavy and seems sturdy and well built. The display is a little confusing at first, but once I read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use."
48,73,4.0,"Being a studio owner I didn't buy this for stage work. Being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades I've had many different tuners including real strobes. So when I picked this up about 8 months ago it was because I needed one where I was at and right now.I don't know about the +/- .1% accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it's quite accurate, enough that I can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it. By using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments.I'm still using the replacement battery I put in about 6 months ago but I just use it and unplug. It's travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from 35,000 feet and continue working.I was shocked by how well it works. I was shocked by the fact that I could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close. Highly recommended."
1242,73,1.0,"I normally tune to drop f on my 8 string, but even in standard, I just cant stand the strobe, and theres no other mode. I ordered a pitch black for $70. Im still waiting on the return for this."
15,73,2.0,"It performs ok, although it takes a learning curve getting used to the strobe dial.  I found it too difficult to see from my pedal board, (I am over 60, so eyes ain't what they used to be!).I was also disappointed to find there was no power plug, just battery.  Adding a 1 Spot power proved difficult as the only way to run the battery adapter is along the side where the pedal is pushed.  I fixed problem by taking my Dremmel and grinding a groove just big enough for wires to be unobstructed.For the above reasons, I have elected to use this as my work bench tuner for guitar set up and have gone to the Ashdown Engineering tuner for my pedal board."
1037,73,4.0,"As a musician for over four decades I've owned a number of tuners as the technology progressed.  My primary instrument is electric bass.  This is the finest piece of equipment I've ever purchased and used, and it has helped me solve a 'mysterious' tuning phenomenon all players apparently face without knowing it.  I'll explain.  But first, some details about the tuner....:  it's construction is extremely solid, and it's heft gives it stability.  When you place it on a surface (top of your amp, floor, your knee.... it stays there!).  Secondly, the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions,...no guessing.  And thirdly, it is extremely sensitive and accurate, which brings me to my explanation of the 'mysterious tuning phenomenon.  At issue is the inability of inexpensive tuners to properly identify frequencies/tones when setting string intonation at the octave fret.  I've been using $25 to $40 tuners (Boss, Korg, etc) over the past few years that would indicate a string is in tune, both for open string and octave.  But, when simultaneously plucking an 'F' note on the 'A' string, and an 'F' note high up on the 'G' string my ear would percieve that they just weren't in tune....the cycles weren't matching.  So, that meant my inexpensive tuner wasn't nearly discriminating enough.  Once I began using this strobe tuner, it clearly showed me (with proper accuracy) graphically what my ear was trying to tell me.  After setting intonation according to the strobe tuner my bass now 'performs' as it should through the range of notes/frets over the length of the neck.  I guess another way of explaining it would be to say that it's like having a GPS that is accurate enough to get you to the right neighborhood, versus one that can get you to the right house.  For the money, I feel I've done myself a good turn by purchasing this strobe tuner.  I'm satisfied.  I still keep one of my inexpensive tuners in my guitar case as it has a built in microphone and can be used by an accoustic guitar player if I'm jamming with somebody.  This strobe tuner is 'cable input' only....no mic, runs on a 9v battery with connectors for a power supply (sold separately).  My only 'complaint' with this device is the battery connector.  It's the typical type that 'plugs' in to the top of your 9v battery with two wires leading to the internals.  I hate them as a rule.  I would prefer solid contact points and a compartment where you would simply insert the battery, just like inserting any other battery type (AA, AAA, C, etc)."
750,73,3.0,"I got this at a great price so decided to give a strobe tuner a try. If you're accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it. While it may technically be more accurate than the cheaper vibration tuners, this advantage is of limited use given that the tuning of guitars still has to have some compromise from perfect in order to be well intonated. One advantage over the clip on tuners (by the way, you can't beat Snarks for the price) is that because it is electronically connected to the guitar it is not affected but other instruments that may be playing at the same time. I've noticed that while trying to tune when playing live by clip on tuner seemed to get &#34;confused&#34; by other instruments."
45,654,4.0,"Every issue I had was ironed out by Mackie support.They are seriously fabulous.I'm using this for a simple weigh station between my DAW and my Tascam 16 track.So far, no problems at all."
208,654,4.0,"I have been using this since the day it arrived, it was very easy to setup although windows 8 reads the device as a speaker so the USB does not work for me that way.  It has a great sound and I am very pleased with it."
730,654,4.0,"I could not be happier... Excellent sound, easy controls, very responsive and is better than advertised.  The effects are excellent, and feel and quality of parts are wonderful.  Buy it."
810,654,3.0,"By now, you have probably read about the problem with the USB connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the USB functionality unusable (an Amazon reviewer referred to this as a ""fatal flaw,"" and I heartily agree). I experienced this firsthand, then read folks struggling with the issue on the Mackie support blogs. When I called Mackie support to seek a fix, I was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware. They sent me a new Mackie Board from the newer lots, and I returned my old one. I have not had any problems with the USB functionality since. I am thankful to Mackie for the great customer service, especially since I addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired.I'm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem, but if it does, contact Mackie to get a replacement.At this point, I am still running the board through its paces, but thus far so good."
1230,104,4.0,The reason I stopped using amp stands was because I couldn't find anything collapsible and non-bulky. It works very well and is very sturdy ... I use it for a Hot Rod DeLuxe.
1175,104,2.0,"I love this stand.  I am really disappointed in the cheap, designed-to-fail, bolt-in hardware used to adjust the telescoping rear leg.I think this stand can last a long time if you don't adjust it much, but how much better would it have been had they designed one of those pressure collars with a flip tab, so you are not limited to the holes drilled into the rear leg?  The other hardware isn't much better.For a $50 (list price) stand, On Stage took the cheap route rather than the quality route.  Well, it's only an On Stage product, not Hercules, K&M;, or Atlas, or Ultimate Support.  Cheap stuff, a budget brand, trying to pass as a name brand.Great idea though, and the price is right at $25 street.  Hopefully a better make will put out something more road-worthy."
905,104,4.0,"This stand rocks!  Literally! I don't even have to play the guitar anymore, it does it for me.Kidding aside, this thing is really nice.  I added the boom stand so I can run an SM57 to the surround of my amp's speaker.  I went ahead and ordered two for another amp, just so I don't have to switch them out.  I have a couple of medium sized amps(2 x 10's in each), so I would highly recommend this stand for amplifiers around the same size.  This may not be so great for smaller amps."
1038,674,3.0,I play guitar and stand behind the vocalists. If this does not bring their voices back to me I can&#8217;t hear especially on some of the female solo pieces. It is big help &#8211; be better if we could eliminate the  buzz it causes in the church&#8217;s sound system.
632,674,4.0,"As a musician I wanted both a PA and an instrument amp, but I also wanted extra inputs and outputs. This has it all. Whether you want to output TO a PA or FROM a PA...... TO your guitar amp or FROM it.....and even play your MP3 player while you play AND sing. If you need more inputs, then just output a mixer to it. The tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a 5.5"" speaker. Link to a bass amp or sub-woofer and you definitely have full sound. Certainly loud enough for a 1-man-band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music. I know it's a copy of other speaker/amps... but its a Behringer. I think it's a wonderful and adequate Must-Have for any musician."
862,674,3.0,"I like this speaker system, behringer makes good products when it comes to this. The sound is good and loud, you can control the levels and EQ directly from this so no need for a mixer. You can connect an ipod or laptop to it. And there are multiple sound options including phantom, and instrument. I used a female xlr to 1/4 trs cable but I have been told you can also use xlr to xlr, although I did not try it. The price was great and the wattage was nice. I must say, when we have people come over it is easier to hear them sing. With me playing on the piano it is sometimes hard to hear their voices but now it is equal and sounds nice in harmony. I also connected to microphones to it and it distributes the sound very evenly so it sounds good in a duet.UPDATE: I recently bought a guitar and started to use this amp for my electric fender, IT WORKS GREAT! The sound is great, the wattage is good, everything is wonderful. Highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar."
963,674,4.0,Love this thing. It sounds awesome and is built like a tank. It sound as good as $300 to $400 monitors and the music stand mounting is clever. Does everything I want in a personal stage monitor.
1400,674,3.0,I purchased this PA after reading several reviews and was convinced that is was right for me. I like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack. I was using the ION system it just got to be to much to carry around. I go around to different venues and sing. I just started in April after taking vocals for a year. I love it so much I've purchased this and my  own Shure mic. B205D is a powerful speaker system. I love the crisp sound and now I can hear myself sing when I turn up the music. I needed something with EQ on it as well. you really can't go wrong with this PA/monitor. I would have rated a 5 except when I turn it up around 45 degrees it begins to hiss. I'm not sure if this is normal or not. you see I purchased an open box speaker. The outer box packaging was questionable but once opened the PA itself was in prime condition no visible damage and all the materials were packed well. The sound is great.  I'm testing it out at home for now still have some time if I'm not comfortable with the hissing. Hope this helps with your decision.
1087,674,4.0,"So I originally got the virtually identical Mackie version of this and it crapped out on me after  a couple of years of easy work. Behringer is typically good at making comparable gear at better prices than most. I use this for my vocal monitor attached to my drum rack. So much more efficient than a floor monitor. I have my own volume and tone settings at my fingertips, and because there is more than one channel, I can run a full main mix into it on one channel and mix in a separate feed from my own pa channel. Very cool to be able to mix down a too loud harmony, or turn myself up a little in my ear without affecting any of the other mix dynamics. Definitely recommend ... Hey you get volume and tone and control of your own space!"
69,674,3.0,"I bought this unit for my son's edrums and because of the inputs (RCA, Mic & Instruments). I plugged my guitar in channel 1, mic in 2 & his edrums on RCA and we're good to go. Not as loud as the 10"" or 12"" speakers of course but for small room this will do. Playing music on RCA channel is also nice but you will need to adjust the EQ to get a good highs and lows. Light weight and very portable."
572,674,4.0,"i just got the 3rd monitor.  great price.  got here in 2 days ....so.  my first 2 units have a very bright blue ish color LED for power.the latest one has a very mellow amber color LED.anyone else noticed different color LED's ?comparing the units, the newest one seems to have a differnt type feel on the impact plasctic shell.weight and sound is the same.i use them for everything from full band to acoustic .  great for vocals and guitar.  as stated by others not much bass response ( but from a 5 in speaker what would you expect).mine have been dropped, wet, hot and never missed a beat."
665,717,3.0,These are made solid and are very stable.  I knocked it to 4 stars because they don't match up.  The holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky.
316,717,4.0,They are well built and can hold almost any speaker system you throw at them. I have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them. He likes them too.
291,717,4.0,"Great speaker stands, well constructed easy adjustments for different setups.Carry case nice addition.Recieved set of Two stands with case promptly and in perfect condition.Two stands and carry case delivered for the price of one stand at many places,Great Deal!"
812,717,1.0,"I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. However, the bag was ripped in 3 places. The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway...bit disappointing."
39,717,4.0,"The bag is simple canvas.  It probably won't protect a steel ball from a marshmallow attack.  However, the stands are sturdy, fully adjustable, and look professional."
1335,717,1.0,"Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out, or were missing all together. When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern. It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products."
1176,717,3.0,"These are your basic speaker stands for PA systems...they're functional, durable, and can be set-up within just a few seconds. I would have given this a higher rating, however upon receipt, one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight I had set the tension. While inspecting the bag, I found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand. Further inspection confirmed this as this 'block' was indeed part of the tube, and after several minutes of wrestling with it, I was able to get it lodged back inside. The block was part of the tension &#34;mechanism&#34; and once it was forced back into the tube, the stand(s) performed flawlessly."
1122,547,3.0,It's a great strap. It's comfortable and you can wear it for hours. It looks good as while. I got it earlier then expected and I love it. I would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro.
170,547,3.0,this will work for just about everyone...but i prefer the walker williams brand...but these work fine easy to get strap locks on...will keep on the side for next guitar...you shouild be happy. enjoy
231,547,4.0,I was using a nylon strap before I got this one. I love the feel of this and the fact that its a little wider than my older strap. The leather feels very high quality and the end pieces fit snug on my acoustic guitar and I don't have that worry of it coming loose.
536,547,4.0,"I bought five of these when they were being blown out for like $3 apiece, but even at the normal price they are a bargain.  They are comfortable when used for an extended period of time- even with a heavy Les Paul.  If you play an SG, these will help counter the dreaded 'neck dive' that you get when using a nylon strap with those guitars.  Incidentally, Amazon is selling these straps at about 1/3 the price you would pay at GC.  Highly recommended !"
1272,547,4.0,I can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder.Actually I like the smooth side on my shoulder so it is easy to adjust position without pulling on my shirt.
952,547,2.0,"Over the past couple of months I've been replacing guitar straps.  This one seemed ideal for an everyday all-around strap.  And, it would be, but the holes are too tight.  Really a major chore to get over a strap button.  I had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap.  I've probably bought dozens of straps over the past forty-plus years, and I never had this problem until the latest straps I've purchased--so this strap isn't the only one with which I've had an issue.  A tight-fitting strap isn't in itself a problem, except when one needs to take it off!  Yikes!  Otherwise, this is a nice strap.  Oh, I tried the strap on three guitars, just to be sure the first wasn't an anomaly."
771,547,3.0,Its a little stiff and I'm sure it will soften up upon more use. Cant beat the price! I used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long.
1007,547,4.0,"My go to strap, be it brown or black,Just plain tool leather, can't beat itTakes sweat and breaks in great, always well made."
1363,547,3.0,"When you need a no-nonsense leather strap that is not long, consider this. If you need something fancy, or want to sling your guitar low, or if you are a tall person, probably you want to skip this.I'm 5ft 8"" and I'm already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin, and it's not like I'm trying to hold my guitar particularly low. If you are a tall person, or if you want to mimic Jimmy Page's posture or something, this is not for you.Apart from that, I have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive (it's more so if I believe the ""made in Canada"" sticker on it). Hard to beat it as far as leather straps go. At 2.5 inches wide, it's comfortable, one-ply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough, and the looks of it is not that bad either. Sure, there should be nicer/better product, but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks.The only complaint I have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap. Though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some  elbow grease, it would have been nice if I was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar."
1305,547,4.0,"great leather strap  nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth, it wont dig in Ur shoulder like some other straps out there,,, and u can adjust it ,, i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material,, can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i don't like to play low like to my knees, that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist , so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and  it gives me A great angle for my wrist , to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck,,, so i say great buy,, i give it 5 stars."
1239,547,4.0,My frist guitar strap I like it alot. Dose not cut in your shoulder or back. Will get aother one for 2nd guitar.
865,547,4.0,"Adjustments are easy to make and the fit/feel is fine. No fancy designs, but a great value for the price."
882,170,4.0,"Good strap, very comfortable and strong."
799,170,3.0,"I searched on Amazon for a banjo strap and this came up. When I received the strap I realized it doesn't fit a banjo. I then looked at the description closely and found it says it's a guitar strap. Just to let you know, this is not a banjo strap  :)  I was able use it anyway on my guitar. It's not the best strap in the world, but it's not bad. I gave it four stars for that reason. I think it would wear quickly with lots of use."
53,170,4.0,"Yes I would ,,buy is a great strap nice comfort nice priceFits nice in to my Fender guitar, a thumbs up"
587,170,3.0,"I bought this strap because I thought the pattern was awesome! The comfort is okay, I never wear it for more than a couple hours at a time. But... just the design man, go planet waves!"
804,170,3.0,"First of all this strap looks super cool. The Hootenany style is sweeeet! I have this on a cream colored strat(like) guitar and it looks great. The reason for only four stars is that the material is a bit thin, but hey, for this price I am not expecting a Levy's strap. All in all this is a great guitar strap. Throw some strap locks on it and away you go!!!"
1101,170,3.0,"It works well for holding up a guitar, and it looks good doing it.  As long as you don't ask it to hold up a bass, you'll be fine (the price is hard to beat too)."
356,170,3.0,"I'm happy enough with this, it looks okay and fits properly so what more could you ask for. Good deal."
584,170,2.0,"It's very thin, all parts about it are kinda thin and cheap, but it works exactly as it should. Not bad if you just need to round out an order to get free shipping. Not for your favorite guitar though, more of a beginner's or a throw-away, 'gig' strap."
106,170,3.0,"Sweet strap, nice colors, good quality.  Adjusts easily, nice quality leather hookups.  Don't forget your strap locks if you're planning to rock out :-)Looks great with my white Fender Jazz Bass Standard!"
1395,170,3.0,"It looks nice, it's really really long and it's made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip. After throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener, rubbing it with lard, dirt and baby powder, then soaking it over night. It's finally soft and I could play naked without slicing off my head!  So buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up!"
1382,170,4.0,The strap is of good quality and since its new it still feel stiff but I am happy that I got it.
145,170,2.0,"The strap looks great.  Very cool design and looks good on my tele.  And all for 7 bucks w/ prime shipping.  So why only 3-stars?  This is my fourth strap purchase from Planet Waves.  I have grown to love Planet Waves' straps for their comfort and durability, and obviously the designs.  I thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design.  Mainly because at my local music shops, I have never seen/felt a Planet Waves strap that was NOT made out of their usual thick, soft, and durable material(whatever that might be) that I have grown to love.  This strap is VERY thin and brittle feeling, which makes it very uncomfortable to use.  This strap DOES slide easily on your shirt (which is what I prefer) but once it makes contact with your neck it is SHARP and it makes your neck sore and itchy.  Needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on, Ouch!  I have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in.  But it is still as sharp as it was out of the package.  Maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up.  That is if it lasts that long.Overall what you need to know is that this strap is NOT the same as the other Planet Waves straps.  The material is very thin and brittle feeling; unlike the many other straps from Planet Waves.  If comfort is not important to you then get this strap.  The price can't be beat and will give your guitar that 70's look.  If I would have paid $20+ on this strap I would be furious.  But at only $7 this strap is still a steal."
1280,170,3.0,"This strap has a fantastic old-school look and vibe, and I've never had it slip off while playing.  The only downside is that it's a bit rough on any loose skin.  I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck (but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t-shirt).  For 99% of situations these strap rocks."
45,273,4.0,"At this price how can you go wrong?Comfortable and sturdy.Works just fine, thank you.Bought another for my Strat."
412,273,4.0,"This is a very comfortable strap.  Because it is cotton, this strap is more flexible than many nylon straps.  It fits the guitar perfect, and is easy to adjust.  Well made, and you can't beat the price."
890,273,4.0,"When I first felt this strap, I smiled...This is so supple to the touch, making playing with it a great experience. Yet it's durable enough even for the roughest of players. It is fully adjustable, allowing for all body types. This is the first strap that I've bought in a long time. I have a Planet Waves strap with studs and I like it very much. I'ts the only strap I've ever used. Untill now. Now I have it put away and I'm using this one. If yore looking for a new strap, I highly recommend this one. Trust me...You will not be disapointed by it. Yeah it looks a little plain, but it doesn't slide around while playing and I love it!! BUY IT ALREADY!! XD"
723,273,4.0,"I got this strap just to try something different than a nylon. At first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around. But after a while I found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when you're playing and will stay nice and steady while playing. Those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well. It is also very long, longer than i thought. I have it slung a little low, and there's plenty of slack left on the strap. So it's probably long enough for Shaq to use it and still sling it as low as James Hetfield.  The only complaint I have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul. But again it adds another feature to the strap, since the thing isn't falling off anytime soon! I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks it's so good. Also the holes are very strong and have not torn open at all, which usually happens on a heavy guitar like the one I have.  All in all a perfect buy for the money."
181,273,3.0,"This strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily. I plan on using strap locks so it won't matter to me but if you don't use strap locks, your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole day.My advice. Install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment. Then choose comfortable straps that won't scratch your guitar (like this one)."
602,273,4.0,"Leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible.  Nylon has incredible strength but isn't very comfortable.  In my humble opinion, cotton twill is totally the way to go.  It's comfortable and adequately strong.  This strap is sturdy and robust, and it's plain black.  You can't go wrong here.Schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap.  You should buy those too, they're great.It gets five stars for being not only better than most other competing products, but also a lot cheaper."
1271,273,4.0,"Looking for a strap that is sturdy, comfortable, and simple in design, I use this strap along with and without the Planet Waves quick release system, perfect for use when I am standing and playing.  I have several, for our electrics and acoustics.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
816,273,4.0,As good as advertized.Rugged and sturdy.Live up to expectations and is comfortable.I would definitely buy a few more of these.
271,442,2.0,"This is a lower quality Leather StrapPros:CheapLeatherEasy adjustment designCons:Leather was low quality - rough and hard to the touchLeather had scrape marks on front and back of strapEyelits for attaching to guitar are not incredibly tight, , I need strap locks to feel safe with the strapLeather lacks give and is rough, rubs neck and shoulder and digs into flesh with heavier guitars or base.It is an OK strap... not great... but cheap"
1170,442,3.0,"While not as soft and supple as suede straps, I am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well. The button holes were a little tight, but thats not a bad thing. It is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot. It is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker. All-in-all it's a good strap for the money, which wasn't much."
952,442,3.0,"This is a nice leather strap, not thick, but very functional and nice looking.  I found it a bit uncomfortable with a heavyweight electric guitar, but should work just fine with an acoustic."
885,442,4.0,"Planet Waves Classic Leather Guitar Strap Black is good product.It's soft and pretty, and looks nice with my Strat.Recommend it."
690,442,4.0,"nice strap, i meant its just a basic strap, so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far. should last a while with good care."
340,442,4.0,"This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow)."
136,442,4.0,Nice solid no frills guitar strap. I used this on my stupid heavy Agile guitar and it helped a lot.
1249,442,4.0,"I bought this strap because I wanted to draw on it with sharpie and then cover it with a clear coat to preserve the sharpie. This is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface. My plan worked, and this is a good quality strap to do it on. And such a good price."
1007,442,4.0,"Good leather good build, made to last  and age nicely.  I like leather best of all things it feels proper, and I like simple let the guitar stand out, keep the strap simple but elegant."
776,442,4.0,"I ordered two of these based on the review and indeed, this guitar strap deserves 5 stars.It feel like leather but I am not 100% it is true leather. However, at 10$ a piece, I have to give it 5 stars.I used to have nylon straps and these twist too easily. This one does not twist, saves me lot of times, especially during gigs.I will order two more (I have 4 different kind of guitars, acoustic, classical, electric and bass), it fit all of them."
667,442,4.0,"Good quality and very comfortable for the material and with of belt, no matter how heavy your axe is. Can't go wrong with this one."
1393,442,3.0,"This is a very GOOD General purpose strap! A little stiff, but I'm hoping it will loosen up with use."
351,442,4.0,This is a great guitar strap for the money.  I have a similar strap made of thicker leather that I really like but it cost 4 times as much. The strap is comfortable and adjustable. I liked the strap enough that I bought a couple of more in different colors.
1106,442,4.0,As the title says 8 weeks in and no issues at all.  It's comfortable and sturdy.  What else could you want in a guitar strap?
1029,119,4.0,this real leather strap is nice the price is Evan better the only thing I should warm if your a extra large person or you have a beer belly then this strap will not fit you
859,119,3.0,For the price it is mostly comfortable and of sturdy build.  It matches my Epiphone Sheraton II well although it doesn't &#34;twist&#34; easily (my neck strap pin is on the backside of the guitar).
1316,119,3.0,"This is, for the price I paid for it here on Amazon (far less than what it is currently selling for) a very good buy.  At the current price of almost 30 bucks, I would pass or look at other options but that is just me.  The leather is attractive, thick enough, soft enough for the price, and I found the length to be more than long enough for me personally.  I almost have it on the shortest possible setting and there is far more room to let out.  Only really tall people, big people, or ""low players"" will be disappointed perhaps.  I only have a few very MINOR complaints and of course my complaints are subjective so YMMV.  One, the back side of the strap is not black.  It's a blue/grey color and I didn't realize that.  You can see a tiny bit of the greyish color in the photo but not enough to really get an idea of what the backside looks like.  I assumed incorrectly that both sides were black.  Two, the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes.  All that said, it is nice and some will love it.  Quality at the right price.  Easy to adjust.  Looks like it will last.  Solid four stars despite me personal opinion."
1103,119,4.0,"I purchased one of these a few weeks back and loved it so much that I just had to order another one.  If you want comfort, styple, at a good price, I highly recommend these guitar straps."
402,119,2.0,I don't like these too much. The back side will shed for a while before settling down. The leather is rather soft. I've purchased other similar straps that work better and feel more comfortable. This particular one is just ok.
240,119,2.0,Would not say it is the best feeling strap but does look very nice.. It is a little stiff feeling compared to the others I have purchased but overall it is very nice.
170,179,3.0,"yes, a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior...easy to install strap locks...use on blue strat and looks great..enjoy"
859,179,3.0,The only solid white leather strap I could find that didn't have any ornamentation.  It is of average quality but for the price I wasn't expecting much.  It looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black Ibanez RG550XX.
680,179,3.0,It isn't the softest strap. But the width makes it feel better till it's &#34;broken-in&#34;. Good leather that should last a long time.  I have very similer straps that have lasted 30+ years.
664,179,3.0,"Nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right now.It is a single strip of leather with no padding.Maybe it just needs to be broken in.Compliments the color on my Lake Placid blue strat well.For the record, this strap is actually quite long - even in the second strap hole.I am about 5'9"" and a trim 155 lbs.At the shortest setting I can manage, the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when I am sitting.Update 2011-Jul-31: The strap is still rather stiff.I will probably pick up a white cotton strap.Those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently, in my opinion."
278,179,4.0,Strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost.  Clean well packaged .  Has adjustment for length the hole size is per very good will take some working to get it on the guitar so you need not worry about slipping off.  I will still use a strap lock .  Nice product I suggest it .
367,179,2.0,"i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around. This makes a good spare, but I would not use it and trust it on stage. It is thin leather and doesn't seem like it will hold up under any abusive situation. That's just my opinion of it, you may not see it like that and have no fear of it. I would fear it."
785,179,4.0,"It's the same as the other flavors, which all work fine, but it looks great with my new white Gretch."
548,179,4.0,"I do question the leather part but since it doesn't say what kind of leather I suppose thats fine, its still a good strap either way."
1125,738,4.0,It's well made. Not much else you can say about it. Buy it. It is worth it. Packaged very well.
1388,738,3.0,"I ended up ordering this cable to connect a 535Q Wah into a Dyna Comp on my Pedaltrain 2 board. It's the perfect length, as the 1/2 foot cable was just a little bit too short. Since then, I've ordered these patch cable in other lengths, and they've done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard."
263,738,3.0,"I have had really good luck with the planet wave patch cables.  They haven't had a huge amount of use, but none of them have went bad or caused any excess noise, and I've bought over 10 of them."
1181,738,0.0,"I got a few of these as a Christmas gift and they're just bad.  I put them on my pedalboard where I previously had longer cables and these just didn't stay in the jack.  I have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these.  If I play loudly and my room vibrates a bit, the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal.  Awful."
29,738,3.0,Perfect for patching effects pedals together that are further apart. Good quality cable with a good price. Most of my cables are from Planet Waves and I've never had an issue.
438,738,4.0,These cords work great and helped me (finally) clean up a mess of longer cords running between various voice processors and mixer.  The set-up went from a mess of eight neatly wrapped 6 ft cords to these 1 footers.  Looks great.  Cords are sturdy - I haven't had nor do I foresee any issues with them.  Would definitely buy again.
966,738,4.0,It comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy. They come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective. Great price as well.
1331,738,3.0,"I purchased a BUNCH of Planet Waves Classic cables for my new pedal board. The cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you. However, I am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible. My complaint, like other reviews I read, is that the end doesn't seem to fit snug on some connections. For me these cables fit very well with the MXR pedals, Dunlop wah and the Ibanez pedal. The Boss pedals however, were hit or miss. Can't say for sure if this is Plant Waves design problem or Boss, but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the Boss pedals. I have a couple EHX pedals also, one side is snug the other loose. Anyway, for the money, I think you will be happy with the Planet Waves cable, nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable."
1238,738,4.0,awesome patch cables for your pedalboard. they are not as rigid as your typical patch cables which works for winding in and around pedals easier and you can twist and angle them however you want without stressing your input jacks. love Planet Waves gear.
226,222,4.0,"What can I say? It's a cable. It works very well on a pedalboard. I personally use it to cable my pedal together from the first row to second row. That requires a cable longer than 6"" or 1 foot. The 3 foot is perfect and it works great!"
625,222,4.0,Planet waves knows hot to make great quality and economic stuff. All of the cables in my pedalboard are planet waves
15,222,4.0,Good cords with a decent length.  I like the right angle as sometimes it gets tight in a pedal box.  I order the longer cord to go to my wah pedal which I always set outside of my pedal board.  Works quite well.
1093,222,4.0,Nice quality plug. I used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals. Works great and no noise! The shielding on these Planet Waves cables are great.
34,222,4.0,"Using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal. Works great, no noise. Well made cable with bullet-proof molded TS protection. The cable is slightly on the thin side, but it functions well. Without a doubt, a very sturdy cable."
1388,222,3.0,"I ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row, on a Pedaltrain 2 board. It's the perfect length, and the very slight bit of excess can be zip-tied against the Pedaltrain, leaving a total stealth install. Since then, I've ordered these patch cable in other lengths, and they've done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard."
426,222,2.0,This is just another cable out there - There is nothing special in particular about it. It does what it should. Cheers!
181,222,4.0,"They work great, they're quiet and they're cheap. What else can you ask for? I'm very happy with the product"
263,222,4.0,I really like the soft flexible cable these have. They were perfect for my pedal board. Highly recommended. You will find yourself wanting more than you purchased.
1238,222,4.0,"exactly what i needed to set up my pedal board. the flexibility is awesome, you can wind it underneath and around the pedal board and still plug it in to the pedals with out straining."
1281,222,3.0,"This jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required & a 10 ft. cable is too long. I would not depend on it for night after night abuse but, it just may last longer than I think. Planet Waves does make good products."
1372,367,4.0,I absolutely love these strings. I'm used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly. They have a great full sound and after breaking them in after a couple weeks of playing they give a really good classic P bass sound. Its not for people who want the modern brighter sound but for the classic 50s 60s and 70s sound these are great!
680,367,4.0,"Who would have thought you could buy ""quality"" bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDs?The strings are, with out a doubt, real Fender strings. And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparably-priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store.But...Because you don't have the opportunity to compare strings; I do recommend that you know what you want.I've also purchased ""top shelf"" guitar stings, as well as a variety of other products, from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service."
904,367,4.0,"Good bottom, the stainless give's you a nice treble,there's still a good flatwound sound, i use roundwound on my other basses but it was nice to come back."
1230,367,4.0,"In a world of round wound strings, flat wounds (the original bass starings) aren't as popular. These are nice and bright ... love 'em!"
340,367,4.0,"Strings are so subjective and perform so differently depending on the instrument, I have a hard time reviewing them. I have them on an older MIM P bass and am quickly falling in love with them. I tried GHS flats on this bass previously- about all I can say is meh (too rough - they feel more like half rounds, just not the right tone on this particular instrument). I've got another P bass (fretless) with Labella Jamerson's on it (which are still my favorite flats), but these are a close second. Add to that they're half the price of the Labella's, and we've got an easy winner. They're silky smooth, and probably more versatile than the Labella's as there's plenty of top end for a wide variety of styles and music. My tone knob has never been more useful!"
455,367,4.0,"Great flatwound strings. I put these on my J-bass over a year ago and they still sound and feel awesome. They are stainless steel and very smooth. I have never tried other flats except for chromes on my Tele and Fender tapewounds on my fretless, so my view may be biased. For what I paid and how they sound, feel, and have lasted, I am very pleased."
625,775,4.0,"This is an amazing amp. It works great, a lot of power, a little bit heavy for it's size but it is simply a beauty. I play a godin a6 ultra and the The sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect. Even the acoustic sound is majestic. this amp adapts to any need you have, from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound."
732,775,3.0,"I've had this for about 3 years and I agree with every one here that this is a fantastic amp at a good price point.  It's a wonderful sounding amp and gives you good chimey cleans and lush distorted breakup.  It only gets better as the speaker breaks in so make sure you put lots of hours on it initially and you will be rewarded.  If it was between this an a Blues Jr. which are similarly powered and priced I'd opt for this in a second.  I think the AC15C1 is actually a better blues amp.(Opinions vary of course)I only have a couple is ""wishes"" as they're not really gripes.  One is the stock reverb.  It's really overboard in a way that I didn't find musical.  I ordered a new tank and now it's great.  I hope Vox changed this out because I found anything over 2 on the stock tank way too much.  Second would be an FX loop.  Not a deal breaker as the amp takes pedals well but it would a good feature as wold be channel switching built in.  Third and last I wish it came with a footswitch to turn the Trem and Verb on/off and switch between the top boost and normal channels.  I know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice.  Probably one of the reasons it's so affordable.And speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an a/b/y switch for this.  It allows you to switch between the top boost/normal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at the same time and let me tell you there are some really sweet tones when you run both channels at once.  I've gone through a fair amount of gear in my time but don't see getting rid of this.  It's such a fun little amp that it's nice to have around even if it were not my main go-to amp.  It's certainly loud enough for small venues and jamming with a controlled drummer but it's not going to shake the paint off the walls like an AC30.  Highly recommended."
531,775,4.0,"At the $600 price point for an all tube amp PLUS reverb and tremelo (well, there are two pedals I won't have to buy) this is insane. It is not only REALLY loud, but you can do anything from jangly pop to Pink Floyd to hard rock (high gain modern metal heads, though, might want to look at ENGL). I dialed in a Richie Blackmore tone the other day and just started blasting away.It's also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use.The only thing that was a drag about it was that the footswitch, which controls the reverb and tremolo, is sold separately (at about $40 street) and everybody was out. I managed to snag one, but it involved a bit of luck. They should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks."
1389,775,4.0,"I play in our band at church and as such, I've been wanting a Vox AC15 for quite some time.  For those of you who do not play contemporary Christian music and are wondering what the heck I'm talking about, let's just say that it's an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music, you must utilize a Vox tone.  Because of U2.  I know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it.Anyway, for the past few years I've been utilizing a Line 6 Floor POD Plus to achieve this tone.  I've been using the ""Class A"" sound, which is close, and quite useable, but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and I've never found a way around that.  I just sort of dealt with it.  Then came Father's Day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used Vox AC15C1 and I love everything about it.  Doing a little research, it seems that its predecessor (AC15CC1) was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners.  Well, the AC15C1 implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that's awesome right out of the box.  I've seen some people complain about the fact that it's a PCB inside and not hand-wired, and that it's made in China.  So what.  It sounds very nice, especially for the low price.The amp's overdrive is very rich, with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume.  I cranked it to 10 in my living room and was quire loud for a 15W amp, but not window-shattering loud.  In a church setting this is obviously not an option.  Fortunately, you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy Vox tone, just at a more manageable level.  You need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the ""Top Boost"" and ""Normal"" channels.  I've opted to just use the ""Normal"" channel and push it with a Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal, which by the way, is the most impressive $40 overdrive pedal you'll ever hear.  That overdrive does not interfere with the Vox tone at all.  I used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with DiMarzio HS series pickups and the Joyo pedal pushing the amp, and it was classic Vox chime all the way.  I also used a Boss DD-5 delay (also required if you play in a Christian band - same reason as the other thing I mentioned...)  Pure tone heaven.Some have noted noise or ""hiss"" problems with this amp, which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes.  Mine did not have this problem.  Actually, I thought it did, and I was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before I realized that it was the way I had the amp set up:  As I stated earlier, this is a 2-channel amp (Normal and Top Boost), but which one you're using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into.  I was plugged into the Normal channel, and didn't realize that the Top Boost volume was dimed and that's where the hiss was coming from.  I just shut that volume completely off since I was not using the Top Boost channel anyway.  Problem solved.I'm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice.  I've owned Marshalls, MESA/Boogies, a Laney, a Music Man, and other oddball tube amps over the years, some costing several times the cost of the Vox AC15C1 and the Vox can hold its own with those others.  Think of it as an affordable ""boutique amp"".  If you can pick one up used like I did, all the better.  Interestingly enough, this amp was advertized as a used Vox AC15 with no indication of whether it was a C1 or a CC1.  Fortunately it was a C1.  It's a value at full price also.  Get one."

So I'm sending it back.I'm going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapProtec Guitar Strap with Leather Ends and Pick Pocket, Blackand straplocksSchaller Security Locks - Nickelfor about the same price.This is mainly a matter of personal preference. If you don't mind the plastic end pieces, this is a beautiful strap."
413,886,4.0,"I'm a beginning player so I'm trying to make things as simple as possible starting out.  I was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic, and really didn't want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks.  This strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar.  The ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze, but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issue.The locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button. To attach, put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed.  Your strap is now locked in place. To remove it, hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position.  That's it.  Really, it's that simple.I'm a taller guy (6'3&#34;) and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should I need it longer at some point. The leather feels robust, and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box.  Can't wait to see how it does after it breaks in. This was a great choice and I couldn't be happier."
439,886,4.0,"This strap is perfect!  It locks on your pins, no worry about sudden disconnects and is comfortable (it's not padded).  Highly recommend!"
811,886,4.0,"I can see this strap lasting a long time. I love how I don't need new strap buttons, considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws (which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor!).You can lock each strap button with one hand- great product!"
643,489,4.0,In October 2009 I ordered a custom Strat and a Bass and the Custom Strat came with these strings. I recommend going with these. The bullet style makes its easier to install. You know what I mean if you are a professional.
1269,489,4.0,For a Fender guitar bullets are the best choice for tone and longevity of strings. They seat snug and enhances sustain. Quality can be found behind the Fender name.
1093,489,4.0,These original bullets are great for my Strat. They are made specifically for the Fender tremolo bridge and fit perfect. The strings sound great and hold up to the &#34;whammy&#34; just fine. Sound great and look great.

885,489,4.0,"Fender Accessories 073-3150-406 Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings, Custom are very good!I got it for my Strat guitar and they sound much better then Ernie Ball or D'Addario (at least on my taste).Recommend it."
142,489,4.0,"These strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good.  If you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced.  Saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the player.\So I (and many others) play nickel.Bullet end?  If you are playing a Stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a whole.Those two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time (I've been using these for years) have proven to me to be the optimal string for the Stratocaster.These are durable.  Do they last?  Well, yes they do.  I rotate guitars on the gigs so I would say that if I was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as I do through the week - I end up changing them out every 2 to 3 weeks and I'm playing 4 nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and I put them through a rigorous workout.What would that equate to  in hours?  Hmmm...  60 to 80 hours perhaps, maybe a bit more.  Add to that sweat, natural oils, oxidation, and that I don't use cleaners or chems on the strings, although I do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel."

226,288,4.0,The jam man solo is an AMAZING pedal. Yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that. The one thing that i thought was so awesome was that after you have played something you can save it to the pedal. It is a very handy tool. Another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats. If would %100 recommend this pedal to anyone. It is a looper that will loop all day and does way more than just loop. What more could you possibly ask for??
583,288,3.0,"the product is great. a lot of nice features. i am running it through a little Cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use. best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion. if you havethe amp overdriven, then the loop comes out that way too, and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellation.Trying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what you're trying to play over.Great pedal, but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through."
57,288,4.0,"A looper pedal has been on my list of things I'd like to get some day for a long long time. Why I waited so long to get one, I can't say. All I can say is how glad I am not only that I finally got one but that I got this one. It is fantastic. Here's why.First, ease of use. I really thought I'd be slowly working my way through a long manual, then slowly figuring out how to use the pedal. On the contrary, I got this out of the box, plugged it in, and was recording my first loops in a matter of minutes. The instructions a brief, clear, and walk you through the steps. This manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars. As I delved deeper into the options I was able to quickly figure out how to do everything I wanted to do.Second, user interface. It's a pedal. It's got knobs and buttons. This makes me very happy. It's well laid out and easy to get to all the settings. Once you've got it up and running, I strongly recommend setting it up so you can set a rhythm on a new loop by tapping the pedal. The work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple.Third, features. It has built in drum beats that are simple but sound better than just a metronome and help you get in the mood to jam out your loops. The beat is like a guide track, not recorded into the loop.Fourth, plays nice with computers. There's a usb port and you can connect this to the computer with a standard cable (not included) and copy your loops to the free downloadable loop library software. There you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them.Fifth, comes with an AC adapter. It actually has to since it does not run on batteries, but still, I was happy to see it in the box.Sixth, you can add an SD card (not included) to expand the memory substantially.All of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience. The experience for me has been pure jamming joy. I hear a song in my head, and very quickly have the basic concept captured as a loop. You can plug your electric guitar or a mic into the input, so you can capture anything you want.For the price this is a wonderful piece of gear, and my only regret is not having bought one sooner. I'm having so much fun with it."
333,288,4.0,Just wanted to say that they pack a lot into this pedal. I practice more now in the past 2 months than I have in the past two years. I highly recommend it if you are looking to spruce up your song writing skills and most of all your soloing skills. We got a good deal too. Amazon rocks!
233,288,2.0,I would give this 5 stars for the way it works but a 49 page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much. Something simpler would suffice. Really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it. If you don't mind spending the time to learn all it's capabilities it's great.
461,288,4.0,"sing that in a drivin and cryin 90s alt rock way. why? cause that's what this bad boy (or girl to be pc) does. It is instant ideas. The thing that makes this so simple and effective is you can simply record a riff (or melody/top part), then create around it, loop by loop, or just one idea with another on top. As simple as this sounds, otherwise, you would have to record a track, then play over that, taking time and killing inspiration in the process.There are others on the market, to be sure. I had the boss looper with 2 pedals, and it was noisy on playback. That was years ago, and I couldn't get rid of it fast enough! I've used delay pedals my whole life, and being a fan of shoegaze/dream pop, I have always had a love of layered guitars/loops, a la the church or the chameleons, or chapterhouse, lush, house of love, and stuff.I looked on youtube and read reviews for a while before my purchase, as I don't have money to waste. This seemed to be the best choice for me. The use of this live, especially without the footswitch (sold seperately), would be tough to be sure. There are some stop and start moments, as to be the case with loopers. The only one I've seen that seems seamless is the boss one or roland one with like 5 pedals and is like 700 bucks maybe more. There are demos of a guy looping himself with different instruments all running into it. For the price, it should be and is great.This little wonder though, is fantastic. The price can't be beat, and it doesn't suck up tone as some of the other ones do from what I've read. The thing I would say is, it's best for recording, and to use as an audio notepad in a way. You can use saved loops in songs, but since they are already formed, so it's silly to start a song with 5 guitars in a dense dance!my last thought on this, this is a secret, come closer......closer now...come on I won't bite..........A VOLUME PEDAL! that way you can layer with different adjusted levels and not bending down and fixing levels and such. sounds simple, but you'll see. I am going to look for a decent one."
702,288,3.0,"This is a great pedal. I bought the extra footswitch to go with it, it makes it alot easier to operate. Does all I need it to do. Wish it were stereo. Stores 99 loops, doubt I'd ever in my lifetime need that many. I haven't tried the computer interface yet."
284,288,4.0,"Although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal, I was recording in an hour & had the software on my Mac talking to it. It sounds great with little of it's own noise. The percussion loops are fine & at least provide solid guides for recording. I have a GNX4 that I love & as far as this pedal goes, I am just as happy. I echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch, it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over & fiddling with the small knobs. ( Update ) The software works well & is very useful. It loaded right up with no problem. Memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once I start using the pedal more often. That's the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal. More than worth it though."
764,288,4.0,"I just got this thing and have only learned the basics of looping (I've done two jams so far) but I can already tell it's an amazing tool for any serious guitarist. The reviewer Shawn in PA hit the nail on the head with his comment that he's ""playing guitar twice as much and getting twice as good"" - that's a great compliment on this pedal and I agree 100%.  What I especially like about this pedal is that it feels like it was the ""missing link"" in my collection of gear and brings it all together. I'm using my guitar, my mixer, my bass, my drum machine, my monitors whereas before just doing recording seemed like a bit of a chore - this thing really puts the FUN back in playing.  I think this is the one piece of equipment that will really bring out my creativity and I can't wait to see what I come up with, with my new ""band"" :-)"
383,288,4.0,"I have used the Line 6 looper in the past -Line 6 JM4 Looper. The Line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the SpiderJam amplifier. It's a decent looper, but it's too big and I don't need all the guitar tones, backing tracks, etc., that go with it so I decided to look elsewhere.I wanted a looper that I could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality (multiple channels, etc.) and this one fit the bill. You can adjust the loop volume, switch quickly between tracks, turn the background percussion down (or off), etc. I purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracks.The only fault that I've found thus far is that the foot switch cable that DigiTech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a 90 degree. This is weird, as all pedals on a board need a 90 degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal. To solve this, I bought a Hosa 90 degree stereo connector (it has to be stereo) -HOSA RT. ANGL. STER. 1/4"" PHONE (F) - STEREO 1/4"" PHONE (M). I've added a photo of the JamMan on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thePedaltrain MINI With Soft Casephotos.One other great attribute of this pedal is it's built solid and is easy to stomp on (you don't have to have perfect aim, just good timing). There are a few strange nuances, though. For example, you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track. This gets the track started before it clears it. Not good if you were using it in a performance. However, there are workarounds (like just switching tracks). Overall - great deal for the price and, if you are looking to improve your lead guitar/improv, I would certainly recommend a pedal like this one."

It is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable.This is a professional wireless system.Best purchase I've made this year.You won't be disappointed; it is worth the price."
524,93,4.0,Wanted a good compressor on the front of my signal chain for a pedalboard setup for electric guitar and this pedal is working great for my purposes at a good price. Have it set for a little compression to smooth out and add some sustain to the signal before going into anything else and never turn it off.
1060,93,4.0,"After trying about every comp out there for years, I came across this, I have a Wampler Ego Compressor too, it is the same quality as the Ego Compressor.Better than the Script Reissue, it was too noisey for me."
1157,93,4.0,"Compression is possibly one of the most misunderstood pedal (or rack) effects for guitar players, but I can say confidently that the MXR Custom Comp gets it right, and makes it easy.WHAT IT DOES - First, a quick word about compression.  The easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitar's pure tone.  When you play an uncompressed guitar signal, you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively.  On the other side of the problem, you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous ""ringing"" effect, but find that the individual notes die out too soon.  A quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them.  It also can ""sustain"" the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away, depending on the settings.BUILD QUALITY - If there are complaints to be had about the MXR Custom Comp, they aren't related to durability.  MXR pedals, like BOSS pedals, are built with heavy-duty metal, yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed.  Unlike BOSS pedals, the switch is in the form of a metal button that ""clicks"" when you press it.  My understanding from veteran MXR users is that the switch is very reliable and long-lasting.  In my case, however, I intend on having the thing on all the time, so this is not a major concern anyway.One gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal ""Attack"" control.  The pedal has knobs for Output (volume) and Sensitivity (basically, amount of compression).  The ""Attack"" knob, which is found on some rival compressors, has to do with the degree of ""pick attack"" sound you want when you first hit the note, and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly.  But on the MXR Custom Comp, you need to remove the back plate (4 Phillips screws) and adjust the Attack know with a screwdriver.  You also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery, though I've switched to a power adapter/daisy chain (OneSpot) for my pedals anyway.  So, yes, it's an inconvenience, but with this type of effect, it's not like you would want to adjust the Attack the way you would mess with Tone or Gain on a distortion pedal.  I consider this also to be a non-issue.TONE/SOUND QUALITY - The sound quality of this effect is outstanding.  It is far more ""transparent"" than other pedals I've tried in terms of retaining the tonal characteristics of my guitar, but leveling everything out for a great ""finishing touch"".  Whereas I used to think of compression as an ""effect"" I would turn on for a specific type of tone, I could envision always leaving this effect on with the MXR Custom Comp.  It simply makes my underlying clean tone and other effects more manageable and better sounding.COMPARISON TO OTHER PEDALS - The toughest question to ask about the MXR Custom Comp is whether it is worth the extra money.  The top-end professional compressors (Keeley pedals, rack units, etc.) are usually north of $200, which isn't practical for a casual player.  Boss makes the CS-3 Compression Sustainer, which is the pedal I traded in for the Custom Comp.  The CS-3 is more affordable (about $50 to $75 new) and more customizable, with 4 knobs on the exterior of the pedal, adding ""Attack"" and ""Sustain"".  It definitely does the job in terms of adding sustain, and might make sense if you only want to play around with compression from time to time.  But much like with MXR's entry level compressor (The Dyna Comp in the red casing), it simply isn't up to the quality of this pedal.ADVICE - While compression doesn't ""color"" your guitar tone the way a distortion pedal does, it's arguably as important to your overall tone quality as any other pedal.  If you're interested in compression and want the best option at an affordable price, I recommend the Custom Comp at $100 or less on Amazon, or used on eBay, where I've seen it go for about $70 to $85.  It may not be ""necessary"" for everyone, but very few people who try it will come away disappointed.  Turn it on, play with the settings for a minute or two, and then leave it on and strum away."
1070,93,4.0,"When I do my reviews, I consider how well does the stompbox do what it does versus the price. I give the MXR Custom Comp five stars because, while it sounds nowhere near as good nor is as easy to use as a Keely, you will pay substantially less. On the other hand, it sounds better than a Boss CS-3 and is more versatile than an MXR Dyna Comp. It is also cheaper than the MXR 76 Vintage Compressor (which has no LED or AC adaptor). So, I think that the MXR Custom Comp is worth considering when shopping for a compressor. You should watch demos on YouTube and many stores sell MXR so you can try one out. If you want an inexpensive compressor with LED, AC adaptor, and a versatile sound palette, then the MXR Custom Comp is pretty good.Anyone who argues that compression does not change your tone has not fully explored the potential of a compressor. If you would like some evidence, consider a song like The Fixx ""One Thing Leads to Another"" which was created in part by cranking a compressor up. The manual gives three settings you might try--""Chicken Pickin',"" ""New Wave Reggae,"" and ""Chime Bloom""--each of which sounds different. The MXR Custom Comp can also give you volume boost if you wish to use it for that function, and I think it does so wayyyyy better than the Boss CS-3 (which seems more apt at volume drop, you have to crank it all the way to get a boost).One problem with this compressor is that there are four control knobs, two on the exterior (Output & Sensitivity) and two in the interior (Attack & Trim). In order to set it as the manual suggests, you will have to open up the case with a screwdriver and turn the two dials inside the box. Because of that, I just set it on ""New Wave Reggae"" (for 80s sounds, funk, etc.) and manipulate the external controls as needed. If I was playing country, I would simply switch it to ""Chicken Pickin'"" and leave it. If you are playing multiple styles, I would seek a different compressor like a 4-knob Keely.A second problem with the MXR Custom Comp is noise. If you crank the Output up, it creates a buzz (in my rig) that can be taken care of with a noise gate. The Dyna Comp does the same thing, but I did not hear that as much on the Keely or Boss CS-3.I find that leaving the compressor on all the time sharpens my tone without taking it over, but at the same time I can easily vary the Sensitivity to get different tone/sustain. It can give an awful lot of bell-like sustain on clean sounds and works great with a chorus pedal.BOTTOM LINE:(1) Nice compressor for the price, especially if you want versatile sound palette, good volume boost(2) Hard to work with due to interior controls (dumb!)(3) Generates noisy signal when cranked(4) Gives sound like MXR 76 Vintage Comp with less cost, plus on/off LED & AC adaptor at cheaper price(5) Good compressor in its price range (Keely is far superior in sound but you pay for it!)(6) OK paint job, doesn't really catch my eye"
187,490,4.0,"These days on my pedal board I have several MXR Micro pedals...They have slowly earned their way on the board and eventually pushed some expensive boutique pedals into early retirementThe MXR Mirco Chorus is a perfect ""One Trick Pony"" it does one thing beautifully and simply - and that one thing is create a soft velvety chorus effect with good chime tones - when I activate the MXR Custom Comp pedal in conjunction with the MXR Micro Chorus I can easily copy the Andy Summers Police sound and a few other notable chorus stylesNote:It works great with distortion and with clean compressionI never have to bend over and adjust a bunch of NOBS in the dark - simply control the one speed NOB with my foot (on the fly quite simply)Presently I use these MXR products:The MXR Custom Comp = I highly recommend this very subtle very professional compression pedal (read any review of this pedal you'll see why)The MXR Micro Flanger = Easy, sounds amazing, never have to bend over and fiddle with it, does Jet airplane to subtle wavesThe MXR Micro Chours = Easy soft sounding with good chime - never have to bend over and fiddle with it - simple foot controlAnd the old standard (Ive had this since the 1980's) the MXR Phase 45 - simply the best phase pedal ever made - and I've tried them all"

822,490,4.0,Well worth the [...] bucks i paid. Analog with true bypass. Easy to use with one knob. And has nice high quality chorus effect. MXR built like a tank. Works with my Boss DS1 AC adapter too.
400,490,3.0,Very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal. If all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy.
866,490,4.0,"This is a super easy to use pedal. You just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset. Don't worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound. If you really want to be able to tweak everything, then get the MXR Analog chorus instead. It has about six knobs. I like the ease of use on this one, and I omly use chorus sparingly. Another cool feature of MXR pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it. It allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot."
884,490,0.0,"I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived. Just to find out it WASN'T WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to Mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement.I will try to fix it through some local electrician or something. Very dissapointing!"
88,490,4.0,"This is a simple analog chorus.  Its straight forward and perfect for any board, and guitarist, that needs a little chorus from time to time, like myself."
681,13,4.0,"This is the Godzilla of volume pedals. It is a beautiful, massive, piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as I run signal through it. It appears to be indestructible. I like that it has a &#34;tuner output&#34; and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver. When a friend offered to sell his for $30 bucks I bought it without hesitation. I now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my Ditto looper so I can fade it out. Volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results. If you need &#34;light&#34;, maybe keep looking. If you don't mind the heft, you will be pleased."
597,13,4.0,I like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works. Why that's overly important in a volume pedal I'm not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging. It takes up a huge footprint on a board so I generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoe/boot on the thing and that is comforting while playing. Overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and doesn't suck the tone like other volume pedals. Good buy-
866,13,2.0,"It works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal. I had a hard time making small volume changes while singing. I decided to return it. It is well made, so if you like volume pedals, it's probably one of the best. I have also owned the Moreley Lil Alligator volume pedal. It has a mimimum volume knob which allows more subtle changes between rhythm and lead volumes. The Dunlop does not have that feature."
1059,13,3.0,"I bought this pedal, tried it out and returned it.  On the plus side, it is quiet, sturdy, has a reasonable footprint, does not suck tone, and it is passive.  But the feel was not quite right for me:  Even with the adjustable tension - I couldn't lock it in to where I wanted it.  I'm very used to the Ernie Ball pedals, and I also like the new Morley Volume Plus.But to be fair, pedal tension is a pretty personal factor, and this might easily be a 5 star product for you."
1018,13,4.0,"Outside of a vintage Show Bud volume pedal - this is possibly the finest volume pedal on the market today.Very smooth and accurate - I like the feel of this unit - and the sound is transparent - I cannot tell if it is in or out of my signal path.I run this volume pedal AFTER my pedal board at this time - I have a dirty pedal, delay, chorus and tuner on the board at this time. But I am upgrading to a larger pedal board soon - and will place the volume after the dirty pedals and before the delay and chorus pedals at that time.The pedal is heavy - sturdy - thick rubber pad on top - nice rubber the bottom that covers the entire underneath of the pedal.Built like a tank - brushed finish - connections on the front.It is very big - I wear an 11 1/2 shoe and it fits my foot very well - so this is not for a small pedal board.There is a tension adjustment on this unit so the end user can dial the feel of the pedal in to his or her liking.If you need a volume pedal just buy this one - you won't be sorry.******************************************Just as a reference I have used an Ernie Ball - the one with the string - and the Morley volume pedal - this Dunlop Volume pedal is finer than the other two - the fit, finish, sound, feel while using it, ease of use and build quality far exceed any other pedal on the market today."
586,787,4.0,"I bought this USA Fender product to replace an imported piece of junk. Imports often have threads other than 1/4 inch SAE. It fit perfectly on the jack socket threads. Quick install, works like a dream."
813,787,4.0,This was exactly what I was expecting.  Seems to be better quality than other cheaper products I researched.  I'd definitely recommend paying the little bit of extra money for a better quality Fender product like this over other generic output jacks.
660,787,4.0,"This is a genuine Fender Switchcraft brand input jack. It is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies, but that's an easy adaption if using a copy strat. It works perfectly. Great price from the seller as well. If you want a sturdy jack, this is as good as it gets."
720,787,4.0,Just good ol' genuine Fender parts. Nothing to complain about here. I'm a stickler for the OEM parts so I typically by only Fender stuff.
361,787,3.0,"Spent next to nothing on this part, but it saved the day on a side project for a friend.  Thank God I buy spares. this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly. It doesn't get any more elemental, but I soldered it in and it's doing fine.  Not for real heavy usage anyway."
1071,787,4.0,"Great product, with a little soldering knowledge (really basic in fact), you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all. Nice and snug with my American Stage Cables (D'Addario is great! Hey, R. Ford uses them).  Great price too, much less than what my local music shop asks for these."
187,77,4.0,This is an A+ pedalIt's small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely - it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly...The MXR Micro Flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesIf you want a Flanger to do any more than that you're just goofing off - mostly I need a subtle wash for flanger work and the MXR Micro is perfect for that
842,77,4.0,"Simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician.  Three big ones are the jet sound, choral/flange and leslie speaker!"
1093,77,4.0,"First off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable. Turning the knobs on the pedal reveals the the smooth and efficient quality of the pods. The pedal &#34;gets along&#34; fine with no interference with the other pedals on my board. The sound is exceptional and can be adjusted  within a wide range to one's liking. I can't say it's my favorite pedal, but it sure does play a nice role on my pedal board of various effects."
1112,77,4.0,awesome stuff just what i want it
487,871,3.0,"I purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar, This fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my Jackson dk2 ,  I'm using 3 springs right know and stay's in tune no matter the abuse.the only Con on this product is that they are noisy, is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing."
669,871,4.0,I ordered these because I wanted to deck the tremolo on my Strats because I don't really use the trem. I have a modern American Standard and an American Vintage Reissue Hot Rod 62 Strat. There are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as I can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black. My Standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 Hot Rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with. Easy to install and works like a charm.
650,871,4.0,"I replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my Indiana guitar, and what a difference!!!  The original equipment spring  tension was so stiff that the tremolo didn't even work.  Now it sounds great!"
1219,871,3.0,"I think a set of five is a bit overkill since i only needed three, but these are a direct replacement for the originals."
242,871,4.0,"I purchased a set of Fender Vintage Tremelo Tension Springs in order to ""beef up"" the tremelo tension on an inexpensive Squier Jagmaster guitar that I recently purchased.  These springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the Jagmaster (the loop actually goes all the way around, which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar) and it seems that they are of a higher tension. Highly recommended as replacement springs, or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars."
180,871,4.0,At first I wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my MIM Stratocaster for it was the last thing I needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo. After installing these tremolo springs (which by the way have a nice flexible tension) I notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved. I did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like $20-$30 to enhance tone and sustain on Stratocasters! So at $8 this is definitely a WIN!!!
1405,871,4.0,"works great! pretty simply to swap out the old springs for the new ones, I'd say there was a slightly more smooth feel now when I use the whammy bar"
190,871,4.0,"Good upgrade, Fender vintage springs. Use 5 of them (in my case) and they work well. I would recommend this."
1071,871,4.0,"I purchased these to replace the springs on my USA Standard Stratocaster.  These hold a lot more tension than the modern style black springs.  Holds your Trem solidly in place and reduces travel during bends.  Using 10's on my Strat, 3 springs was sufficient, if you want to hard tail it, just drop all 5 in. Great product."
476,871,4.0,Fender springs. You'll need a pliers or needle nose to grab and stretch them to reach the hole. There's too much tension to do it with your fingers. My American Special Strat came with 3 springs and now has the five. I find it stays in tune like a &#34;instrument&#34; should now.
17,176,4.0,"Got this to put into my Pseudo-caster project guitar. Love it! Be warned, it does NOT come with springs, claw or trem bar. If you order this, get the tremolo bar for the Mexican model. The threads are smaller on these.If you like to do &#34;dive bombs&#34;, you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block. It will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness.Last important note... Make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance. If it matches spec on this Trem, all the screw holes will match up."
977,176,4.0,"I gave this a 5 star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar, I replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar, it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing, I did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone, sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar"
937,176,4.0,"Very nice bridge. This was an OEM part so didn't come with screws, springs,claw, or tremolo bar, just the bridge itself. Not the best but for the price was a killer deal. The block is full size, probably zinc or some mystery metal, vintage bent saddles. Would be a good replacement for an older MIM Strat with the smaller block, or other Asian import, or just to replace one that's wore out. Like I stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality."
650,176,4.0,"This bridge is heavily constructed, so the amplified sound is much more vibrant and alive.  It must weigh twice as much as the bridge from my old Indiana Custom S-Type Guitar.  I'm glad I replaced it.  Now I have a lot more guitar for my money.  I probably spent $200 total on my Fender bridge assembly, locking tuners, and Tex-Mex pickups, as well as the original $59 for my used guitar, and I would say I now have the functional equivalent of a $500 Fender Stratocaster, based on sound quality and ease of fingering.  This was time and money well spent."
113,789,4.0,"Excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic Squire Strat series.  This Bridge has more strength and solidness than the original.  Replace the Tremelo Arm with the one offered on Amazon as well.Key:  This bridge is slightly thicker/higher than the one it replaces on the Squire, so the back plate won't fit back on...something to mod if you need a backplate, but the difference in the quality make it worth the loss."
260,789,4.0,"This comes COMPLETE with bridge, saddles and full size block... and it's FENDER! I don't think this is a true steel block. I believe it's Zinc Alloy but that's Fender's fault. The company I bought it from, Ant Hill Music via Amazon, is very honest and likable people. I have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for Squiers. They made my cv50's sound fuller with greater sustain. I'm sure I'll buy more in the future.I should add it does not come with a whammy bar but your my old squier whammy bars fit perfectly into it!"
1219,789,4.0,"This is a cheap and easy upgrade!!!  At about 20 years old, my MIM Standard strats' hardware was starting to show her age.  Most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust.  For about $40 bucks, I was able to replace all the screws, springs, bridge, neck plate.  This is stage one of my rebuild.  The tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality 10 fold.  Don't forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them."
694,789,4.0,"Works for a cheap bridge on my cheap Stratocaster knock-off. Needed one that was better than the bridge that came with it, and this was a cheap, but not cheaply built option."
1405,789,4.0,replaced my old bridge assembly with this new one and it really brought the strat back to life in terms of looks and feel. also this was priced right in my opinion....
731,697,3.0,The strings have a nice feel to them.Used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase.They improved the action considerably.
1368,697,4.0,"These are great strings.  I thought the bullet end was BS hype, but I really think it makes the string stronger and the sound clearer. And even if that is my rusty ears lying to me, I can say with conviction that they definitely fit better with my G&L Legacy guitars - regular strings had the little extra wind from the ball end coming right up to the saddle in some cases - these solve that problem."
443,697,4.0,"I use these strings for my Telecasters and I have to say the tone is wonderful, beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use. Very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar."
1151,697,4.0,With a twang twing twong nothing wrong... gotta love these strings that just wanna sing.
140,697,2.0,"I am revising my previous review on the 3250L's...I have now only had these on my American Stratocaster for two weeks.  I loved them so much at first that I ordered 5 other sets and restrung several of my other Strats and other guitars.BIG mistake.  Why am I so impatient?These were unbelievable right out of the box, bring my Strat to life, giving it an unbelievable feel and sound.But, with every positive, there's usually a negative....and wait for it.....wait for it...yup, there was.I changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my Strat and noticed all three smaller strings. G,B &E; were all flat on the fret side.  They were already worn out.  I suspected something as the sound had changed already too, becoming flat after only about a week.This is NOT mu only guitar, I now have 17 total and rotate playing so I bet I hadn't played the Strat for more than6 hours or so.Now, I'm so disappointed.  I'm going to step up to the 250's, then the 150 if I have to.  I love the sound but don't want to change strings every week.To make a long story short, I wouldn't buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings."
354,697,4.0,These are great strings and were my favorite until I found Fender Pure Nickel strings.  Some may like the sound of these some may like the Pure Nickel
669,697,4.0,"I've been a Fender player since I first picked up the guitar. I've used different strings from D'Darrio to Ernie Ball and now I always use Fender strings. For Stratocasters I always use Super Bullets and for Telecasters I use Super 250s. The only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the 250s. The bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a Strat. I don't use the tremolo very much so I don't know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super 250s I figure I might as well get the ones that are designed for the Strat. Also, these are the OEM strings that Fender installs at the factory so you can't go wrong with that. I highly recommend them."
263,697,4.0,Having trouble with my usual D'Adderio strings I decided to go back to the a well known brand.  These are solid strings that never let me down.  They go in tune and stay in tune.  I just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them.
260,697,4.0,Great strings! Used them for years -- always loved them. Put them on an Eric Johnson strat. Wouldn't use anything low quality for that guitar.
1199,697,4.0,I put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time. Great strings and great value
1031,697,3.0,"Theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves!!! The heavy bottons 32, 42 and 52 adds a BOOM in the tone. The others, 10, 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also. I don't rate it 5 stars for the lack of VCI. When i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection. The high strings were plenty of flakes. If fender solved that it would be perfect."
1258,697,3.0,These seem to be quite well constructed electric guitar strings which I will appreciate for a long while.  Rock On!
1318,697,4.0,"I had an issue with my new Squire Guitar, and Fender hooked me up with a set of these.  The String Ends have a Cylindrical or Bullet Shaped end, rather then the typical small loop.  The theory is that the larger bullet end makes better contact in the tremolo cavity.  I say they sound great and are worth trying.  I just order 3-packs so I can have some on hand."
1064,697,3.0,Thsese are the perfect size for my Jazzmaster.  Too bad the seem to get dirty so quickly.  Maybe my hands are just sweaty
1390,697,4.0,"These strings sound super awesome! I'm not sure what the engineering specifics are, but if your looking for responsive, easy on the fingers strings with nice bendability and sustainability, these puppies won't let you down."
580,697,4.0,the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe
459,697,4.0,"These were the strings I started on a year ago ,and have tried a few different brands in this time frame. They hold up IMO as well or better than most brands I've tried ,especially for the price. I probably change my strings more than necessary so I have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality. These fit that requirement well."
761,295,4.0,"I ordered these for my son who is a whiz on the guitar. He uses them for both electric guitar and acoustic guitar. He swears by them and loves how they stay in his grip without slipping while picking and going nutso on his guitars! Buy them, you won't be sorry. Plus, wow its a great price."
533,295,3.0,Easy to hold onto. I'm a big fan of the Dunlop picks and these are great for playing live because you simply won't drop them.
1021,295,4.0,I have tried other picks like this that had points which wen't as confortable. This one is more confortable and has great grip. If you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out.
723,295,4.0,"These things are so great! I get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and I'd have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick. With these I can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere. The .88 thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups. Very nice. One thing yo note is they like to cling to each other, so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it. but not that big a deal. Definitely recommend these if you're sick of picks slipping out of your hands!"
1177,295,4.0,these come in multiple thickness and are great because of the thickness and the grip that is on the pick. makes it much easier to hold the pick as your hands get sweaty
604,295,4.0,"I pick a lot when I play the bass (fast, rock stuff) and these are perfect! They bend just the right amount so I don't make any loud plucking sounds while playing. They really grip too. Short of using superglue on your fingers, these definitely do what say they do!"
280,295,4.0,I have been playing music for years and often I lose my picks during a performance.  I took a chance on these picks a few years ago and since then not one have slipped through my fingers!  Best pick ever!!!
1088,295,4.0,"I mostly play metal (7,6 string extended scale) and usually lean towards heavy duty picks such as Dava for riffs. But these picks are pretty amazing! The diamond-steel pattern creates a lot of grip and it is pretty hard to drop one of these, compared to a basic pick. This is a great product and would definitely recommend this to any level of player."
755,295,4.0,"Not too hard, not too soft. My friend gave me this pick and i missed it after using .36mm. Everyone has their own preference and i just didn't like the feel of those. I bought this 12 pack and they... Are... AWESOME!! I lost like 3 already but hey, there's more. I use them for my electric and acoustic guitar."
402,295,3.0,I decided to try these because the &#34;normal&#34; picks I was using kept slipping out of my fingers. That was several months ago. I am still using these everyday. Pretty durable and reliable. I do recommend these.
962,295,2.0,"I was expecting these to be like other dunlop picks I've had in the past, but these are rather cheap-feeling. Dislike."
1271,295,3.0,"I purchased several thicknesses for my son so he can test them all to determine which ones he liked best.  These 1.0 are not the ones he likes.  I would not get these again in this size.  A little too stiff.  The quality of the picks and grip are great and that is why I rated 4 stars.  The stiffness is just due to preference.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
967,295,4.0,I started using these a few years ago.  Picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps.
320,295,4.0,"I've always been partial to .88 picks.  I used the standard dunlop nylon for years.  The max grip just is very difficult to drop, effortless to hold on to.  Because it's so effortless to hold, I can focus my attention on other things."
248,295,3.0,I've used these for years....acoustic and electric. Very hard to beat. I like the feel and texture of these &#34;pics&#34;. They do the job brilliantly.
215,295,3.0,"I normally use Dunlop&#8217;s 0.60mm nylon picks, but decided to give the 0.60mm Max-Grips a try, when the price dropped to $3.00 for a dozen.The top half of the Max-Grips have a special surface with tiny ridges, that gently bite into the skin to provide a nice secure grip.  The feeling is a little strange at first, but you should get used to it quickly.I like the feel and playability of the 0.60mm Max Grip&#8217;s, but they are little more flexible than I prefer, so if I were to get another set, I would get a thicker type, either0.73mmor0.88mm."
1015,238,4.0,"Although this light is a little pricey in my opinion, it really gets the job done. I do like the fact that you can use batteries or a/cadapter to power the light. The nine led's really light up my music stand. The carrying case that comes with it is well made & makestransportation & keeping it stored easy.R. Joyner"
918,238,4.0,"That's why I got this...I needed light without the heat!  It works fine.  Just sorry it's a little pain to keep taking battery out if I want to use the AC connection.  Other than that, it's fine, and pretty well constructed.  Seems to take a few bangs without problems!"
786,238,2.0,"I have used the Manhasset orchestra light, and this is definitely an improvement, it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page, unlike the Manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven.  It illuminates my entire largeManhasset M54 Regal Conductor's Music Standquite well by itself.Having said that, for a 40 bucks light, it feels rather flimsy to me. In both construction and light brightness, it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights, all of which are usually much cheaper (the issue being mainly the light switch, the jury is out about the clamp, though it seems strong). Of course, as an orchestra light, it couldn't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose, I am just pointing out that I feel it isn't worth 40 dollars, when you consider the whole field of similar lights (those not intended for orchestra).I bought this because of reputation and reviews, but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor, theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clip-on 9 LEDS with Adapter.  That one has the same negative issues as this light, but at a much more acceptable $18.99 plus free shipping.One more thing, you should ignore the ""Frequently Bought Together"" suggestion to get theMighty Bright 80910 Bright Light Cradlefor this light.  I bought it, and can confirm they are totally incompatible, and anyways, this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping, if desired."
281,238,3.0,"I bought this because I had a gig in a dark bar.  I used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly.  For some songs I have three sheet of paper (which overlapped about an inch) and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots.  I can't imagine in what situation I would ever need to use the brighter setting. I was thinking of getting the cheaper/smaller version, but didn't want to risk it not covering three pages. The gig bag is a square and softly padded. There is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so I don't expect much protection for the light or adapter.  Treat the light like it has no bag and you'll be fine.  They include 3 batteries (I didn't see them until I pulled out the adapter for this review) to get you started using the light, but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you shouldn't have to worry about it making it to your power supply."
735,238,4.0,"I've owned a half-dozen LED music stand lights over the years. This one puts them all in the shade (pun intended; sorry).The 9-LED bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern. The light is concentrated in the desired area and doesn't spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights. The little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when it's pointed back at the music. The light is two-level: normal and BRIGHT! Normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater. The fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of stand-light bulbs is a definite plus. If you need to put a color filter over it, you don't have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter. The light spread is so smooth and consistent that I don't have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with two-head stand lights.The gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well. The included AC adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights. The included zipper case is fairly big and bulky, but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag. It has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries, a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light, and a small pocket for the AC adapter. It's hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket, but there's plenty of room for it in the case. I don't know about battery life yet, but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the AC adapter (usually an optional purchase).This light is a bit large compared to other LED stand lights, but it's so good that I don't really care. I've gotten years of service from Mighty Bright lights, and I expect the same from this. Even if this one doesn't last, I'll keep buying more."
435,238,4.0,"Excellent stand light. Provides a cool, bright, clean white light and will cover three or four pages.A  &#34;must-have&#34; if you play in pits or other dimly-lit venues.Get it!"
306,669,4.0,"Never used this seller or site for this purpose before. Sat and went through everything and chose these strap locks. They fit perfectly  and I have used them on Strat, and a Levinson Blade, not forgeting my Ibenez. Easy, on time delivery, no hassle with either the quality or service. This seller is worth supporting. Thanks!!"
569,669,4.0,Nice straplock system! Very easy to install as compared to other systems. The system is a secure locking system. This is my favorite locking system I have in my arsenal.
1183,669,4.0,"Love these things.I feel a little guilty because I put a pair on my Epiphone Les Paul plus top. I also have them on my Fender Marauder and now I can easily swap straps between guitars and I'm secure in the knowledge it's not going to land on my foot.Yeah you could put one of those plastic Dunlop pick looking things on a regular strap to keep it in place but these look and feel so much cooler. They use a quick connect of the kind found in natural gas, and compressed air connectors. Pull up on the locking ring, slide it on and release."
783,669,4.0,I have been using strap locks of all types for years. This new Fender Straplocks make installing them on the strap easy. I'm impressed with them. You will be too.
1383,669,4.0,"I bought these for my new Strat. They look great, they're easy to install, and they work very well.I like the release, it's performed by squeezing with your thumb over the ""F"" and with your finger on the the metal ring on the inside of the guitar strap. Hard to explain, but I prefer this to some of the pull-style strap locks I've seen in the past.The only down side is that they aren't as easy to install or uninstall from the strap as the locks that attach with a Hex-type nut. Make sure you have the strap set up at the correct length (for vintage-style leather straps) before you install the locks to avoid having to rework later."
1312,669,0.0,"One of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged, and my very expensive Fender Custom Shop Telecaster fell flat on the ground."
441,669,4.0,"The best look and performance on a Fender guitar.  I've used the Schaller & Fender pinch top and found these to be the best performing, easiest to use, and best looking.  It does have a larger profile, but I find it flattering to the fender guitar form.  Easy to install and have never failed me.  I like that there are three pins to ensure a proper grip rather than one pin holding in in a channel like the Schaller & its clones. Outside of security (which I find greater with 3 pins) it all boils down to personal preference when it comes to strap locks."
363,669,3.0,"I gave this strap lock a 4 star only because it is too large for me and is not interchangeable with all of my Schaller locks. It is a great lock and works fine, but is not for me."
40,537,4.0,"This is one beefy string winder.  There is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy $2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstore.Pros:- VERY sturdy- Rotates extremely smoothly- Well balanced- Fits every guitar tuning key I've tried- High-impact plastic body should withstand years (decades?) of abuse- Clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus -- for earplugs, extra end pins, whateverCons:- None whatsoever.Buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits."
467,537,3.0,I am a bass player and most winders don't work very well with the large tuning keys.  This one works better than anyone I have tried.  None of them work as good as I would like.  Once you learn to loosen up on your grip you will get better results.
1000,537,4.0,"This product does what it is designed to do, very very well. It is not used very often but when it is, it works beautifully."
560,537,4.0,I use it to wind my strings! I recommend for the use of stringing up your guitar easily and fast. Very easy to use!
952,537,2.0,"Unquestionably a top-of-the-line manual string winder, but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar's headstock.  On some tuners this might work great, but on various of mine, still sloppy.  For now I'll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb."
453,537,4.0,"What does anyone really want to know about a string winder.  Yes it will help you string your instrument quicker.  And Yes, it's still in one piece. I would buy it again.  You may even buy 2 because the same gnomes that steal pick's and capo's take these too."
660,537,4.0,"There are many cheapie string winders out there, they all look pretty much the same....but they most certainly are not. This one built like a tank. with thick, solid construction. It's built for the long haul. It fits every tuning peg it's ever been fit to, has a cool little compartment built in thats perfect for extra acoustic bridge pins and extra pics, and simply is tough as nails. This is the last one you will ever need to buy."
346,537,4.0,This thing is a TANK!  I don't think you could break this beast if you wanted to!  The last string winder you will ever buy!
365,537,4.0,"I have a Martin HD-28 with the large Grover tuners.  This string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly.If you change your strings regularly, this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tuners.For $6, these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time."
705,569,4.0,Works awesome :)
619,569,3.0,"Can't complain about a price like this!!! Does the job just fine for what it is, not really anything more you could ask for.  Comes with the proper attachment pieces that you need for most (if not all) microphones, folds up nice and small.  Happy all around!"
101,569,3.0,"Good unit for the money, for sure.  It is not road worthy however, in our opinion.  Still, for any smaller gigs, it does a fine job.  Delivery, packaging etc were very good."
566,569,4.0,"Needed boom arm stands and these filled the bill.  Tripod base to get over stage cables, and a boom arm with clips.  Works just fine.  Be sure to check is the length of the arm is OK.  These are slightly shorter than other stands I have."
599,267,4.0,I did not think that an amp this size would sound good. Boy was I surprized. This amp out does my old Roland Cube 60.  THis amp is LOUD...VERY LOUD!!!!!  And the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound. All in all a super amp.
1194,267,4.0,"I have purchased several amps over the last 7 months (see the reviews). I attempted to move to tube amps becuase I wanted to set up a pedal board and dial in my own effects. And really, any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes. I went Vox AC4 and realized I didn't want a tube that already has a defined and limited sound (no fault of the amp - I just had to experience it myself). I also didn't want a modeler impersonating a tube. I loved the Orange Crush, but it was totally unreliable.Enter the ZT. Holy-moley. The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior. Nice break up, very reactive to your playing and literally miles of clean head room. But unlike those tube amps - my pedals can come into play and I can manipulate that clean sound at any level without losing a bit of clarity or depth. It also has an iPod jack, headphone jack and ambiance (i.e. make it sound kind of boxy). It does not model. Like the Crush or Roland Cube, it has it's own voice. I've heard it compars to a Fender Tweed in tone. I guess I can see that, but it still has it's own voice - which is important to me in any amp. I should note - an AC30 or Fender Twin or high end 1x12 Tube still are louder and much fuller. But we're talking $1000+ tube amps.I don't have the matching extension cabinet because I just don't need it. It is REALLY loud. I have a Mustang III and it gets destroyed by the ZT. At 75% volume on the dial, I can hit my DS-1 and actually make out the notes. That is something the Vox AC4 or Fender Blues Junior cannot do without getting muddy. It is fully giggable. I haven't played live with it yet, but in a rehearsel environment, keeping with a loud drummer is no issue. A friend plugged it into his Marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous. Really, just stupid powerful for $300.For blues, jazz or light rock, it's brilliant right out of the box. It not only can do medal with a pedal board, but check youtube for videos of the Lunchbox being played in a live setting by a metal band. It has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility. I would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video. You simply will not find a negative thing about the ZT Lunchbox anywhere. It really is a solid state aimed to take prefessionals away from their bigger, heavier, more expensive tubes. If you play effect laden music, boy are you going to have a hard time walking away from the ZT.If there is a drawback - $300 for a solid state amp that really needs external pedals to shine could be a turn off for some - especially for players looking for a swiss army knife for an amp. Roland, Fender, Line6 and others still have that niche dialed in."
7,267,4.0,"Well this amp does have it's pros and cons, however the cons are overshadowed by the pros.Pros:1) Small!!!! 2) sounds like a big combo amp 3) makes overdrive pedals sound better 4) sustain 5) big bottom bass 6) HD construction and components. 7) I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback. 8) it soundsREALLY good!Cons:1) yes, it ""could"" be louder 2) Not ""bright""Now the details,  I have a tube combo amp and in comparison the ZT is a bit on the dull side as far as presence.Its not that it does not have it, just could use more. However this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion. Solos just sing on this amp.  I feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better. The ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way.  I stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good. I also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when I first turn it on (seems to go away). I know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally. It also seems to have a positive compression/pumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ring.Volume?  For a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill. Mic'ing for larger venues would work just fine.If you're in a LOUD band, you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option. (darn I meant to test before this review). TIP- so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the1/8"" aux input on the back. I tested this and yes, it does go louder for whatever the reason. (I'll be getting a blank 1/8""jack to put it that aux port) A small but very noticeable volume increase. If you need to be LOUDER then I suggest the larger ZT, but its double the price. A friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore. The 12 club ZT is super loud.I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback.1-100 I rate this a 98% gear head satisfaction. Remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 6.5"" speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little box.Check it out the reviews on youtube.PART II -Ok, the extension cabinet option: Hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder. However do NOT use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet - Turn the switch off. It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird. I found out the hard way, verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker. I would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both. You'll know if you touch the back of the amp and its more than warm, but I would not recommend it."
646,267,3.0,"I have been using a ZT Lunchbox Amp for about a year.  Blindfolded you won't confuse it with a Marshall stack or a blackface Deluxe but for a small, portable, solid state amp it works as advertised.  People that say it is loud aren't kidding but there are limits.  The sound from the 6.5"" speaker requires some space to develop.  Up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass.  I use mine for practice at home and for low-volume band rehearsals.  I played it once on stage, mic'd through a PA, but wasn't happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a 12"" speaker.To me it sounds best with humbuckers but I've played single coil guitars (Fender and Gibson) through it with usable results.  If you are after clean volume you might be disappointed.  It only gets so loud before distortion (and noise) becomes annoying.  Players that use a lot of distortion (e.g., Metal) will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume.  While the ZT Lunchbox isn't as versatile as some other small amps, it is great for a ""one trip"" load in at rehearsals.One thing to consider is adding the matching ZT extension cabinet.  It makes a big difference in two ways: two 6.5"" speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound.  Also, because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased.  This is a big help at rehearsals.  I point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room.  I've tried using a guitar speaker cab, a PA speaker, and a PA floor monitor as an extension speaker but the ZT extension cabinet sounds best to me.  It's the same size as the ZT Lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack them.For an ultra-portable guitar (or harmonica) amplifier that can get decently loud the ZT Lunchbox is hard to beat.  But if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a 12"" speaker works better."
516,267,4.0,"I've been playing with my brother's Lunchbox and when he first plugged in for a jam at his house I thought he was joking. This amp can easily cut through drums, even in the close confines of his practice studio. Granted, I am not a heavy hitter, but we were messing around with come classic rock from the early 60s and this amp at three on the volume knob was plenty loud.The tone is very good, but not exceptional. It's not as clean as a Fender or Jazz Chorus, but it's still better than many of the amps I've listened to. If you want to make this a spectacular tome machine plug aBoss FBM-1 Fender '59 Bassman Pedalinto it.About the quirks. The ambiance knob is no substitute for reverb. It does give a hall-like sound as you increase it, but was designed to simulate an open back amp more than a true effect. The gain controls the input signal to the amp, and according to the manual is more like a soft overdrive. The volume level is solely controlled with the volume knob with the gain knob playing no real role in how loud the amp gets. Finally, the speaker switch on the rear is for turning the internal speaker on and off, not the speaker out circuit for routing the signal to an external cab. That means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the 6.5 inch internal speaker off, or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal one.Plugging phones into the headphone jack will NOT turn off the internal speaker. You need to do that with the speaker switch. Personally I love that feature because you can also use the phones jack as an output to a PA with the amp's internal speaker still active.You definitely need to follow the instruction manual, and especially the advanced user's guide, or you may be initially disappointed. My brother returned the first unit he purchased because there was a pop when it was turned on or off, as well as a slight hum when it was idling. The replacement amp exhibited the same problems. However, if you follow the manuals (plural) you can prevent both problems. I mentioned quirks - the power on and off procedure and positioning the gain knob to the mid level are the keys to smoothing the amp out.Bottom line: this tiny amp packs a punch and has sound characteristics that have to be heard to believe. If you want true reverb you will need to plug in a pedal (check out theBoss FRV-1 63 Fender Reverb Pedalif you haven't already), but for small venues and practice rooms the ambiance feature is probably all you need. Do take the time to read the documentation before you start using it because when this amp is properly used it's simply amazing."
517,267,4.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a professional musician, but I have some experience with guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement equipment. I bought this amp for a couple of reasons- I wanted a combo that was light in weight, easy to move,store, and carry, and also was clean sounding and slightly loud. I can get the sound level I want out of this amp without turning the volume knob up more than 1/4, but if I ever want more, there's plenty of headroom there. It is definitely a clean, noise-free amp at moderate sound levels, and I can add effects through my Line6 Pod Pro if I want to, like more drive, reverb, etc.. As far as durability goes, I've only had it for a day, so I can't say. It has a year warranty period. Price through Musiciansfriend was good, I buy everything for music through them( no offense to Amazon). It's solidly built . All in all, a beautifully designed and executed product. Thanks, ZT!Update- 3/1/12 So far, so good! I've played through the amp for a couple weeks now, and it's great. Clean, low noise, I'm used to the controls and love the sound of it. No need to even use my Pod Pro. I'm now thinking of adding an extension speaker cab of my own design, using Eminence Designer software and an Eminence Commonwealth 12"" guitar speaker. Also considering the Lunchbox extension cab. I don't really need more volume but a 12"" speaker might change the sound enough to where I like it, although I like the sound through the 6.5"" speaker it comes with. Always experimenting with my sound. To think some people buy $2000 tube amps, wow I'm not that kind of expert!Update- 3/10/12 I hooked the amp up to a JBL PA cab, and it really rocked! The JBL 15"" woofer in the cab had a lot more bass, so I adjusted the ZT tone to give the signal more treble to compensate. Hooking up an external speaker is definitely a way to get more volume if so desired. Now thinking about an Eminence Deltalite 12"" neodymium speaker in a 1 cu. ft. As an extension speaker."
276,767,4.0,"I started with the flimsy grays. A couple years ago I switched to yellows. Recently I've been learning the art of arpeggio sweeps and this pick is the (  )! For all that are having tone probs with this pick, consider this. Your used to using big picks, which strum hard easily. With these I noticed I have to strum in a tighter, stronger pattern than before to get the same tones. Anyway, the attack on this pick is so just..YES! It flows in sweeps like .... YES! I will never switch from the pick. Oh ya, the grip is perfect. Haven't popped one outa my fingers yet. Just my two cents."
53,767,4.0,"nice grip,,,,  the are great and a excellent quantity in the box for a musician that lost  constantly are lossing guitar  picks"
34,767,4.0,"I have some neurological problems with my picking hand, and can't seem to hold onto picks. I really like these Max Grips a lot, and have found that they are excellent for soloing. Great tone as well. For my tastes, they are are a bit stiff for strumming, but perfect for everything else. I love the size and wouldn't want anything larger. The advantage of these over the Dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip, you can still pick with them. The Davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side. I would say the Davas are slightly more flexible (literally, not figuratively). I use the Dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing. Cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic, as I've been on an electric fixation lately.Also a fan of the regular Jazz IIIs and find they don't slip as much as my Dunlop Tortex picks. I think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering. Still, in terms of grip, they don't hold a candle to the Max Grips. Both picks have their own unique tonal character.I've tried a variety of picks and I think that once you get used to smaller picks, you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward. These jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics. They are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy.Overall, these are my picks of choice, for my style, which is blues-oriented. Surprised there are so few reviews.EDIT: The strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle. It's getting easier with these. I have also since found that while these are fantastic picks, I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack, Red Nylon,1.38mmdespite lack of the Max-Grip raised lettering. They are just the most wonderful picks I've used. I do plan to try out some 2mm picks, however, as I suspect I'm going to prefer a thicker pick; the III nylons feels slightly thicker than the Max-Grips, which I believe is why I prefer them."
467,767,2.0,I'm a bass player and so I don't deal with cut picks much.  These picks are really hard and last forever.  I did not notice any additional string wear or damage.  These would probably better suited to guitarists.
1348,767,3.0,exactly what I was looking for. A Jazz III- sized pick (smaller than a common-sized guitar pick) that works better for me because the grip nubs make it easier to keep it in the proper angle/position
426,767,4.0,"I have tried many picks in my 25+ years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best. I have been using Dunlop for the most recent years, but these are the best. The Carbon Fiber of these Dunlop Jazz III make them as long lasting as you want - when playing rock (slides and picking) they are better than any other material, and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz. Their grip is excellent and they feel awesome. Gotta try them! Highly recommended. Cheers!"
33,767,2.0,"They are tiny. About half the size of a regular pick. My fingers keep hitting the strings.  Nice grip area. Will last forever, sound great. A bit too thick for me."
1177,767,4.0,With the grips these are comfortable and not as prone to falling out of your and when your hand gets moist from sweat
759,767,4.0,These will not wear down which is amazing and they have all the same great qualities as all the other jazz III's. the only problem I have with them is dirt can get between the grip pretty easily which makes them slip but if you clean them well then its not a problem.
627,767,4.0,These picks are a good change of pace. They are easy to grip and do not slide and slip through my fingers. Good investment for the price.
3,767,4.0,I buy these for my son.  He loves the grip on them as they help stop them from slipping out of his hands.  He also likes the small size.  They last forever and don't break.
402,767,2.0,"These have the correct thickness and texture that I want, but they are smaller than a typical pick. So be sure to try them out first before buying. One just cannot tell the size from the picture Amazon has. I wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick (may be dim the ref image a little so people won't get confused). Some people swear by these, but I that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two. May be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration. I won't be buying these again."
293,767,4.0,"If you like thick/heavy gauge picks, but find they wear too fast for you, this is the pick for you. They have a very solid grip to them and are very stiff, but also wear (as in don't wear down) like nothing else. These were a very nice find!"
178,767,4.0,"I got these after using Dunlop Standard Tortex Picks, 12 Pack, Purple, 1.14mm for some time.i would choose the Jazz III are better for ME personally because i used to hold my picks wrong.Due to the smaller size of the Jazz III im forced to be a better picker and player."
938,767,4.0,"One day I was getting ready to play a show and stuck my hand in my pocket...my pick was gone. I checked in my case...no picks. So 3 minutes before I start I'm scrambling all over trying to find a pick. Luckily a friend of mine had a spare and handed me one of these. As soon as I touched it I though, this feel weird. I went and played my set using one of these and I absolutely loved it. The pick feels great in my hand and plays really well. And this was the first time I've played with a pick that I knew wasn't going to come flying out of my fingers. After I got home from the show I jumped on Amazon and ordered a pack for myself. Like I said, I love these things."
1425,767,4.0,"This is not a pick for windmilling guitarists.  This is a pick for the precision player.  It's really small--noticeably smaller than the red Jazz III picks.  With large fingers like mine, it almost disappears.  But the aggressive grip pattern keeps the pick right where you want it.  It's a very stiff pick, with just enough give to keep from sawing your strings off.The picks are first-rate.  Based on my previous experience with Dunlop picks, this 6-pack will last me for years.  I'm inclined to lose a few along the way, just so I can give Dunlop some repeat business."
602,767,4.0,"I've always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work.  Danny Gatton did so, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  These are the absolute best picks I've ever used.  They don't wear down as easily as delrin, tortex, or some other materials.  And, these have a really, really nice textured surface that keeps them from slipping out of your fingers.  I think I'm going to order these in massive bulk quantities and stash them away in case they ever decide to stop manufacturing these..."
913,767,2.0,These picks are nice but just  too small. My only regret is that I had taken more time to research the size.  They work well just need to be a little bigger.
1338,767,4.0,"The Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III carbon fiber picks really helped improve my accuracy, no doubt in large part due to their relative stiffness and profile. I tend to drop picks and have tried numerous brands and types of picks, but for ease of grip these are hard to beat. I am a relatively inexperienced player, and while more experienced players can address technical subtleties better than I can, I have come to depend on these as they have helped me to hugely improve my picking accuracy in a relatively short time. As far as durability goes, they are the reigning champs. I bought a pack of six, and I've been using them for a while now and can't tell them apart: the three I've used look like the three that are still in the bag to my eye. I doubt seriously I will need to buy more for months (who knows, maybe years) as they just don't seem to wear even after hours and hours of use. I recommend these picks without reservation."
921,767,4.0,I do like these picks too.  It has a bit different sound obtained when I use this one.  Will keep them.
247,767,4.0,"To me, this is a pick to pick notes and leads. It does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much. I use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming. I really like the fit/feel of this plucking pick. Smaller, but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings. You might balk at the price but I do not regret it in the least. Some nice picking with this pick. I don't play a lot so I figured 6 ought to last me quite a while. I have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience, too. But the Dunlop is better to me."
1002,767,4.0,"I don't use these alot, but when I play jazz style music or ballads, they work better without playing with heavy attack and give a more mellow tone to the solo's."
351,767,3.0,These picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick. I use them for playing bass. They work well for that. I have not used them for a regular guitar. I prefer a standard pick for that.
774,767,4.0,"A very nice pick, both in feel and texture. Only complaint is that it's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece, where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece. But that's okay. I got this the same time as I got a set of Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III, the yellowish ones, and Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks, and I think I like the Dava picks the best. All three are &#34;tight grip&#34; picks, and all the same size, but they're all good. These picks have a great grip, though, and feel dry and gritty even when they're clean as a bone. Nice!"
323,767,3.0,"I probably got the wrong gauge, these things have no give at all due to the thickness but I like the small size. They are about half the size of a standard pick, so they are very easy to control."
256,651,0.0,"Sounded good. Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15. I rocked all night and loved the sound. Next day i turned it on, my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out. I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well. I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock. Id like to see a real set of jjs, im sure one of them was a dud."
536,651,4.0,Replaced the stock tubes (Groove Tubes) in my Blues Junior with a matched pair of JJs.  Much better tone IMHO.  The sound is exactly what you want in an EL84 and the tubes have held up very well.  I am coming up on needing a complete retube of my Palomino V32 and I will also be using JJs.
1071,651,4.0,"Purchased these to replace some failing power tubes in my Vox NT15H, and all I can say is that they are great.  After a little break in these brought some new life back into my amp. Greatly improved the tone over the stock Sovteks that where in there originally. Great product for a great price."
51,651,3.0,"Bought a couple of these as replacement tubes for my bass amp, and I think they improved the sound over the original EH ones.  These are considered ""boutique tubes"", but I think they're popular for a reason."
685,651,3.0,"Had for over a year, hasn't failed. Bedroom Vox amp, never leaves the house, never turned up above conversational volume level, so I can't elaborate on sound, can only comment on reliability for my usage."
1281,651,4.0,"JJ Tubes are the best sounding vacume tubes & the only tubes that go into my vintage & boutique amps,"
10,563,4.0,I purchased this to teach myself to play a keyboard instrument.  This device has delivered everything I wanted and more.
1073,563,3.0,"This keyboard far exceeded my expectations for the price - the quality of most of the ""bread and butter"" sounds is very high. This keyboard also has tons of neat features - there's something here for musicians of any skill level (check out Yamaha's product blurb).To get an idea of how good this keyboard can sound, search YPG-235 on YouTube and check out ""trying out my Yamaha ypg 235"" by JoshTheMusician90.Since it's also 76 keys (unweighted), MIDI(USB) compliant, very portable and can even run on batteries in a pinch,the YPG-235 could be used in a variety of situations.One star off for a couple of caveats below - Other than that, at around $200, this instrument is a steal.*******In my mind, the only ""negatives"" (aside from trying to install the USB MIDI driver/see below) are that Yamaha sells this keyboard without the AC adapter and sustain pedal as standard accessories, and you really need both. Yamaha should note that a lot of people feel burned by the non-inclusion of the AC adapter.********NOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO USE THIS KEYBOARD VIA USB/MIDI ON A WINDOWS 7 SYSTEMThe USB MIDI drivers for this instrument are provided on a CD - the disk I got only contained drivers up to Windows Vista - I tried cheating and using this driver on my WIN 7 system, but it didn't work. The CD will supply you with a link that should take you directly to the latest driver downloads, but it doesn't - I ran into a lot of problems going that route - I suggest you bypass trying to use the link the CD suggests and just go directly to the Yamaha website to get the latest driver. Much easier, and my YPG-235 now works fine with my computer, but still surprising since most USB MIDI keyboards are plug and play."
1077,563,4.0,Okay it works and is really neat and the price was fantastic.  A great addition and will serve me well
1047,563,4.0,"After having played the Yamaha YPG-535 88-key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard in a showroom and loving it, I was torn, wondering what all I would be missing out on if I went with the more economically priced YPG-235. I now own the 235 and it appears as if I am missing out on twelve keys. That is, I am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer's remorse after opting for the cheaper 235. This is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than I will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality. Of course, my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as I will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited. As such, it might be best to say that, for a novice, one could not ask for a better instrument for the price.So what is the difference between the 235 and the 535? Based on my previous comparative shopping, I have come up with a few differences. First is the obvious fact that the 535 possesses 88 keys, while the 235 has 76. The 535 also includes a stand, sustain pedal, and power adapter, which must be purchased separately for the 235. While I am unaware of the specifics, the 535 also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices. Beyond these definitive differences, having now played both models, the 535 also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality, from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly.Why buy the YPG-235? If price is not an issue, go ahead and get he 535, it is a beautiful instrument. However, for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need 88 keys, purchase the 235. Like the 535, the 235 possesses piano style Graded Soft Touch (GST) keys, which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted. The feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth-style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability. The 235, like the 535, also features USB connectivity and general MIDI compatibility, as well as almost all of the same high quality voices, which separate both the 535 and the 235 from many other models in their price brackets (besides the pianos, the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic). While it is unfortunate that Yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the 235, theYamaha Survival Kit D - Accessory Kit for Yamaha YPG-235 & YPG-235 Keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor, extended warranty, and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply. In my opinion, the YPG-235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck. Again, the 235 sounds great, feels great and is hard to beat for the price!"
457,563,3.0,"This keyboard sounds good, but the inability to go below that low E is just killing me. The speakers are good. Buy a good sustain pedal.M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action for Keyboards"
469,505,4.0,this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from.....the pencil condenser are questionable......they have picked up outside noise(like birds etc) but with a decent bit of white noise (but I may have had them running a bit hot too) the strange clamps have worked well for me
900,505,4.0,"I was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this Saturday's St. Patrick's Day parade.  I took a chance on this kit, even though I have never purchased anything that says ""Pyle"" on the label.  Upon receiving this kit, my first surprise was the quality of the case, and then upon opening, I was surpised to find that these were the EXACT same microphones as the ones I borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings, but branded differently.  He paid about 350-400 for his kit (still cheap by today's standards).I pulled out 1 overhead condensor and the kick-drum mic and mounted them, fired up the PA and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic!  We could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit, or two overheads; they pick up everything very clearly.  I turned up the volume on the kick-drum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly too-small mic.  Now, I have a wonderful drum mix coming from only 2 microphones and my mixer has more channels free than I would have expected.  For fun, I added one of the tom/snare mics and they sounded equally clear.After purchasing this, I can tell you that there is absolutely NO way I would purchase one of the ""high-end"" drum-mic kits.  If you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound, this is it.  I promise you will LOVE the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound."
1130,505,4.0,"Shipped in time. Didn't test microphones yet, but I think this is best price for 7 microphones. According to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well. I'll check it later."
1183,505,3.0,"The good:InexpensiveContains most of the hardware you need, drum mounts, etc.works with 3/8 or 5/8Has a carrying caseThe kick mic has a good low frequency responseThe bad:Has locking clasps with included keys, that are too big for the key holes.Does not contain any of the cabling and you will easily spend as much on that as you did on the microphonesNo instructions on how to use the mounts, or little things like you can use plyers to remove the 3/8"" adapters from the mountsKick mic needs a mic stand, one is not providedThe ugly:The two condenser microphones are incredibly sensitive but at the cost of an incredibly high noise floor. There is a ton of hiss at any level setting and it will make your recording sound like a 1/4"" casette tape unless you EQ out all of the highs on the condensers to kill the hissssss."
302,505,4.0,"I have used these mics more than any other in my mic arsenal. The kick mic's base is beginning to fall apart, but I have used these things on the road all this (brutal) summer and the sound is still the same... I have other more expensive mics, but often use these in clubs as a backup (when the drummer doesn't have a favorite or bring his own kick mic). While it cannot stand up to say (my favorite) the D112, it does the job and the overheads are the easiest o.h. mics I have tried yet. The tom mics work on guitar cabinets and the mounting hardware is still in one piece (except for the kick mic mounting bracket) after months of use. I would suggest these mics as a backup for your expensive mics.UPDATE: Now that I have been using them for a while I can say they are reliable, durable and sound good. My AKG drum mic kit sees more action than the Pyle's, but the Pyle mics are always on hand to mic guitar cabs, percussion instruments like congas and whatever else needs mic'ing. The kick drum mic's mount is falling off, but considering how many times these mics have been hit by errant drum sticks and dropped by inexperienced technicians, they are in great shape. These mics have more life left and I have gotten a good amount of use out of them to this point."
645,505,3.0,"For the money, I doubt you can beat these microphones. I just needed something for occasional outdoor shows and didn't want to spend a ton of money. So far, so good. I will say that the first shipment had a bad mic, but Amazon replaced it for free and paid for re-shipping, so I am happy about that."
191,435,4.0,"I purchased this sometime around September, and when I received it, I tested it, and it seemed to work correctly. I've had no trouble with it that I can remember/think of."
216,435,4.0,"This is a great microphone. It's light, sensitive, and looks professional. I used this alongside my Xonar DG sound card and my recordings sounded clear even when boosted +22dB. I would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording."
1307,435,3.0,"All I can say is, sometimes you get more than what you paid for. While this isn't the new break through tech or the rave of the much, much higher end mics, it does deliver. With a decent mixer you can get a very nice response. Been giggin' since the early 70's and have been hosting an open-mic to boot. I get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice, super affordable microphone ... it's a charm! 'b' B"
1029,435,4.0,great microphone at a very good rice
27,435,2.0,"This could be a great mic and is similar to the Shure SM58.  But I've found that most of these pyle pro audio products tend to have a much higher signal to noise ratio..even plugged into my best preamps in studio.  Spend more money, get some quality mics.  These are only good for garage practice on a budget."
237,435,4.0,"No on/off switch is a bummer, but it works! Solid construction, decent sound, comes with a cable for convenience.UPDATE After playing in a small shed for a while, the bass player was complaining of some crazy rattling when he played a B note. We messed with the PA and all the electronics. What it came down to, was my mic (Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 Professional Moving Coil Dynamic Handheld Microphone) placement. I switched mics and kept them in the exact same position, and the rattle went away. Whats all this mean? The quality of this mic is just ok. If you've got a lot of sound going on, maybe get a better one."
996,435,2.0,"I bought this for my kids aged 6 & 8, they love it. However it has not proven to be kid-proof. The microphone cable is too fragile and they quickly broke the connectors on each end forcing me to buy another cable.When it's working they love singing and it sounds fairly good - no complaints about the sound quality."
973,435,3.0,"Great value! Using it as a back up stage mic. Sound very good and for the price it can't be beat. It does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics, but gets the job done when needed."
515,435,4.0,"Great mic for the price. Is it a SM58? No, but sounds pretty damn good. It's light, don't know if it would handle major abuse, but wow...for 12 bucks. you really can't go wrong. Plus, they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup. It also looks pretty damn sharp. Don't see how they even afford to make these things for this price. If you want a really good SM58 clone, I would recommend a Behringer XM8500. If you are looking for a back up mic, or you are a cheapo, this will probably satisfy you. I would have knocked off a couple of stars if it was over 20 bucks, but for 12 bucks...I don't think you are gonna find a better microphone."
984,435,4.0,"I just received this mic today and tried it out. I purchased it after rave reviews from other Amazon purchasers. This is a heavy solid high quality mic. Are you kidding me at this low price. They giving it away. Heck, the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and it's worth $10 all by itself. I recorded a song today with it and I sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping.  You can't beat this deal. Awesome nice mic."
482,435,4.0,"It was delivered fast. When I hooked it up I didn't expect it to be so loud and clear. So powerful it picked up every breath I took between the lyrics. When I put a wind screen on it, the sound was so nice I couldn't stop singing for another hour. I only meant to test it when I unpacked it. I'm buying more. At that price it's a steal! Get a couple NOW! Before supply and demand kicks in."
1291,435,3.0,"Very close to the sound of an SM-58. Not quite as &#34;warm&#34; as the Shure, but this mic has the best sound for the price. I'm very impressed."
1214,435,4.0,"wow...so pleased with this $12 microphone, packs less of a punch than the Shure SM 58 but works great, very happy so far, used it to microphone some percussion and it worked great, could not really tell the difference from the real thing. If it breaks...so what...it costs 12 bucks, great microphone for someone on a tight budget. Highly recommended."
8,435,3.0,Very cheap and great for price but recording with this isn't the best idea. good for live performance on a budget
671,435,3.0,"Haven't used it with the singer in my band but hooked it up to my amp for a short test. It doesnt appear to be DOA and as some of the other reviewers say, it doesn't appear that I have to be within centimeters for it to pick up. I looked at all the wires inside and they look OK. Nothing out of the ordinary.I'd say if you were Carlos Santana, you might want a better mic, but for those of us in garage bands and local bars, for the price? come on. How do you beat it?"
820,714,4.0,Great tone and tuning stability. Was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat.  Really helped with the bigsby tuning stability
1155,714,3.0,"good,  but it not fit properly,  Defenley better then bone thogh  I did have  to sand it to try to make it fit good, and I did Put it on my epiphone LP,  It does give a nice blues tone,  Beause it's not bone.  But I had to take it off case it just did not fit right"
281,714,4.0,"Perfect replacement.  Did have to take off a little on either side, but other than that it fits.  I used it on a First Act ME501."
240,714,4.0,Such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz.  Makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes.  Worth every penny mind you...  Does require some length and height adjustment for some Epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put..  So far so good.
961,472,4.0,For the money you cant beat this cable. Works with the new mic my daughter got for Christmas and nice quality cord. Will buy more in the future
510,472,3.0,Cheap and good.  Just what I needed.  No issues in over a year.  Must less expensive and just as good as others.
728,472,4.0,"Good, flexible cable.  The connectors are well fitted.  Fast delivery and a good price. I've bought an additional two since my initial purchase."
778,472,4.0,"I own several of these and general buy from GLS direct but I needed some quick and had other orders from Amazon so I got them hear at same price. GLS is great quality and durable. I use there 100', 30' and 25' cords and have never been disappointed!"
619,472,4.0,"Pretty simple, not much review needed for a cut and dry product like this.  Good quality XLR cable that works 100% fine.  I'm happy with this purchase."
1372,472,4.0,Possibly the best quality mic cable I have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear. For the working musician or home recording man this is great! Extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over Southern California and the nation!
773,472,4.0,I received my cables very fast. The xlr male & the xlr Female are well built.No humm so that is a plus.Thank You.
1247,472,4.0,"cords are cords but these are very nice, packaged great, good deal instant turnaround... easy, affordable, fast, why go out? Just go to Amazon. These guys did a super job getting them here fast.... they care about musicians.... we are a tough act to follow...right so look for accesories and cables/cords..etc...at orange County and Amazon...Thanks for caring guys..."
371,472,3.0,"This is my 3rd set of cables I ordered from Amazon. I needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one. The finish  is not bad on the outer PVC layer and coated zinc alloy body. Works fine with my mixer. My previous set of cables ( totally 4 cables) , each one of them develop some kind of problem after few months exactly on the same spot. I guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working. I would see how this goes and update the review. If this one also would result in same condition, I would look for something better. The only reason I ordered the same ones again and again was because of the pricing. They are not expensive to replace."
918,472,2.0,"Some items of GLS work great, others are awful.  Don't trust the products anymore.  It's unfortunate but I don't feel safe with their products, that they'll perform when I need them to.."
837,472,4.0,I received a pair of these two weeks ago and am happy with my purchase. They seem well put together and just feel nice. They also came with two Velcro ties each. With proper care I'm confident these cables will last a very long time.
672,472,4.0,this is a good quality cable and works just as I expected it to.  I like the extra cable 'clips' that came with it so I can keep it wrapped up untangled.
1161,472,3.0,"I always like to carry extra cable when performing, you don't know when one of the one you have breaks and you don't have extras what do you do then, it works and it's great to have extra."
305,472,4.0,I was sure glad that I ordered this cable as a backup. It gets the job done and seems durable for my needs.
873,472,4.0,"Work perfectly with my guitar, good price. No problems with static, crackling, hum or other sound artifacts. Great for amateur vocal recording like me."
797,472,4.0,"What we have here is an XLR male to XLR female black cable. If you're looking for some ridiculous review, this won't be one.Quick pros and cons.Pros1. It's a nice, thick cable.2. It's 25ft long as promised. I measured (not really).3. It worked (didn't arrive dead).ConsNone really.This seems like a nice, high quality cable. Are there better? I have no clue, I'm an amateur. I needed an XLR to go with my GLS ES-57 and this fit the bill. Plugged into my mixer, plugged into the mic, and transmitted proper audio from one to the other. That's really all it's designed to do thus, 5 stars!"
203,472,4.0,"GLS cables are quality cables at a good price. I suppose you could spend more, and still be happy, but why not spend less if it works as well? Then spend your savings on something else! I've been happy with all of GLS products so far."
1128,472,4.0,I bought this audio cable and all I gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble. Good stuff!
423,472,4.0,These cables seem to be better quality than Nady or some other cheap brands I've seen. They work great for me. I'll wait and see how they hold up in the log run. Fingers crossed.I haven't had any problems with them at all so far.
466,472,4.0,"Needed an XLR cable for a gig and ordered one of these the week before...it got the job done, my bass sounded great through the PA, and the crowd loved the band. Home run!"
677,472,4.0,"I am president of the International Press Association a global organization of photographers, videographers and journalists.  We have been teaching our members to convert from shooting stills to videos on their DSLR cameras. I needed this cord and a shorter one for an important assignment on a cruise ship and these guys came through in time for me to use both cords.  You can see them in use at our online publication IMPress in this article and video.  Thanks guys will be shopping with you again.[...]"
748,472,3.0,"works great, appears to be well made, good connectors, twenty five foot allows a great deal of movement, good value"
495,472,4.0,"This is actually quite good, no problems after 2 seasons of work, and the neutrik knock-off connectors plug into devices well. The funny thing is they don't connect that easily to each other, like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run, but a little finagling will get them to mate. I'm not one to cheap out on a lot of things, but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays. I'm not saying there isn't a place for high quality cables, but If you have jobs were you don't need cables made of pure spun 100% angel's pubic hair, these will get the job done."
1250,472,4.0,Purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home.  The cable is great because it's long enough to allow us to move our mic where we need it.  I got this item much quicker than I expected.  The shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition.  Seller is A+ in my book.  If we need more of this type of equipment would certainly buy from them again.
1265,472,4.0,"These come with two Velcro straps to hold the cable in a bundle, which is convenient.  I use this for a microphone, and it seems to be solidly-built.  If I need more, I'll probably buy this again."
1406,472,3.0,"So I went for budget pricing without going to the absolute cheapest.Using for audio acquisition for film / video purpose.Pleasantly surprised at the construction quality of this cable, considering it's made in China; We'll see how they hold up over time.So far, clean sound using a shotgun mic straight into a Zoom H4 recorder.My only gripe is that the rubber grommet between the metal connector and cable was obviously not put on straight during manufacture, and will not go on all the way. (on the female side) Probably one few out of many, let's hope.It's those small attention to details that worry me about stuff made in china.Overall though, a great value for a quality cable."
1062,154,4.0,"I read many negative reviews on several sites.  I can understand how the quality may not be consistent, but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician, I must say that the set I just purchased is quite good, especially the lower pitched harps in G, A and Bb.  There are minor tuning issues with all instruments, especially folk instruments.  This is what gives them their charm and voice.  I find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and I will not need replacement harps right away, as many have stated they had to do.  The set is quite nice, for the price!"
970,154,4.0,"This is certainly a step up from the Hohner Piedmont Blues Harmonica Set that Amazon sells.  I have that one too.  I thought it was O.K., but I found that some of the harps don't work well and the gawd-awful smell!  Actually it went away after awhile, but in the beginning the plastic odor made me light headed.Anywho....This is a nicer set.  All harps work.  They feel substantial. No smell.  Pay the extra money and get this set.**UPDATE**  The letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly.  A nusisance."
1266,154,1.0,"I bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes I record, the notes don't bend easily...if you think your will cheat the big boys harps, youll be dissapointed quickly...these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps, they feel cheap but have a decent sound ...i dont know if they will last, but to make harp noises without decent bends ... Ill use these sparingly...Jim"
127,154,3.0,"Nice presentation, although the harmonicas are plastic, they look and sounds great. Also the price is great, so go ahead, buy it and have fun."
1258,154,4.0,"A very attrative, complete assemblage of blues harp.  With one in each key and relatively small size this is a must have."
1289,154,0.0,"I play harp with some some that I perform. I found that all of these Harmonica's the note's are off and it's hard to play, I have G Blues harp that I compared the G harp to and the notes were a little off. The C harp was terrible. That said the only thing I like about this order is the case. I going to see if I can return them for store credit."
1214,154,3.0,"you really have to have a lot of wind inside you to play these harmonicas, they are great but you really got to blow hard to get them rocking, adding distortion to them helps to brings out a better sound live or in the studio. These fit my budget and plus you get EVERY KEY you need for any song......WOW... Hohner has been around forever, well constructed instrument and very reliable company."
784,154,2.0,"Let me start by saying that I never even opened these. I've given it a 3 star merely out of respect for Hohner. I have no clue how they play, so you'll have to look at other review for that info.I ordered this product based on the fact that the description states ""Includes a deluxe, red pro type hard shell case"". Well... not from Music123 it doesn't. When I asked Music123 about this, they said ""oh... well, we provide Amazon with our catalogue, and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items"". REALLY!!!???Not only did this not come in the red case (which I didn't really care about anyway), it didn't come in any version of this case style (which I was interested in). The case that's shown, is the case that's sold individually on many sites for $19. So I figured... wow!... what the heck? I'm getting 7 harmonicas that cost $6 a piece if puchased individually, and I'm getting a $19 case with them. You'd be silly not to bite on that, right? Well... they came in a cheaper, nondescript black zipper case, not the one with the Hohner logo on it. Save your money and order this through Musicians Friend. It's the same price, free shipping, and you get the actual item as it's described on their site.In closing... it's been a week since I sent this product back to Music123, and I still have not received my refund. Do yourself a favor and avoid them!!!"
446,154,2.0,"I bought this mostly for the case and to have a few backup harps kicking around if I need them.Some of the harps are out of tune slightly, not a big deal, especially considering what all you get here...This is an alright set for a beginner, and a good cheap backup set for a more advanced harp blower.I'll use the case for my higher end Hohners as needed."
107,154,3.0,"If you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track, these will not help much. That being said, these are not junk, nor are they cheap nasty instruments - there are plenty available that are much worse than these. Straight from the case, these don't bend well, but do not despair. Having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days (about eight hours of playing) So far I have persuaded the G A Bb and C to bend enough to satisfy curiosity, but they will not hold up to serious playing. I do not destroy my harps easily, so am not the most aggressive player out there, but I felt like these would certainly be something even I may wear out pretty quickly. For the purpose I intended these to perform they are about perfect - with me breaking them in, I can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics.  Better use these inexpensive harps to over-blow and squawk through, than the set I will be buying in six months; if the promise of musical ability follows through. The advantage of the plastic comb is that I don't need to pass on any germs with them - they wash very easily, with no damage. For the price, you get seven good harps, that make presentable learner instruments, with just a little prep. Without the experienced blues player to break them in, it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them - there are many YouTube videos that will teach the method, so try hard, persevere and you will crack it with these harps  - try learning bending on the lower key instruments first; they will be easier."
740,600,4.0,"Nice and thick, the adhesive is very strong. I have used it on microphone electronics to shield out RF noise. If you don't have the shielding grounded, or in a continuous loop, it won't work. If you hear hum, it's not the shielding, it's your technique."
570,600,2.0,"You really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly. The single order wasn't really enough to do one guitar and I doubt you could do a bass, either. I used the copper under a clear pickguard, which matched the rest of the guitar pretty closely. Then, I finished the pickguard compartment and the jack area with aluminum foil tape from my local hardware store."
586,600,4.0,"This is the best thing I have done to my Telecaster. I had some noise, even at moderate volumes. After shielding, it is absolutely quiet. This peel and stick tape has conductive glue, so you don't have to solder the overlap joints. I overlapped about 1/4&#34; and had a 3 1/2&#34; X 8&#34; piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity. The tape is petty easy to use, sticks well inside the cavities and is strong( I didn't break or tear any pieces). I will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build. There is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups."
539,600,4.0,"If your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it, even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise, interference , I installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music, no more hum, noise, crackling etc. overall this was an excellent buy"
1330,646,2.0,"I bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele. I am having a hard time using the picks on my uke. I guess, I don't like the way the uke sounds when using them. It sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff.But I am sure other people may disagree. As far as the quality and vendor delivery, I am happy and I have no complaints.I use the picks occasionally. Yes, I would recommend them to other uke players. I would like to let people know they are very stiff. I guess I thought being felt they wouldn't be so stiff. But I am new to playing an instrument, and I guess I just don't have much knowledge about picks."
299,646,1.0,"The picks work well with bass, but they are just too thick to use with ukulele. The pics also shed easily, making your instrument dusty in no time."
227,344,4.0,"THis is a 5 star stand, considering the price. Sure, it's not as sturdy as one costing a lot more, but it does what it's supposed to do without any problems.  I don't forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough.  It's a music stand, so I don't see how it would take a lot of abuse."
761,344,4.0,"I bought two of these, one for each of my sons (12 and 14). I wanted something sturdy that would stand the test of time and of boys that age. So far they seem awesome. They adjust easily, were easy to assemble and have a great weight to them. Definitely not a flimsy stand."
1186,344,3.0,Attaching hardware is a bit cheap but over all it is better than I expected.Bag was ripped so I almost lost the screw and washer.This will work fine for me I think.
738,344,3.0,"I'd been shopping for a music stand at local music stores, all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are $45 plus tax. This item including shipping cost me only about $23 here from Amazon, and the seller Musician's Friend sent it promptly, got it within 10 business days without any problems. I had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions. The bolts aren't as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand, but I don't care about that. It's not hard to adjust, and most of the time I have it at a certain height, so no need to fiddle with it, but during a group performance, it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother. If you're someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier, but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height, it's no big deal. Other than that, it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should, for 1/2 price off retail. Excellent. I'm completely satisfied with this."
15,344,4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter to use at home for her flute practice.  Very sturdy and well made stand and adjusts very easily even for a 12 year old.  Should last her a very long time.
1006,344,3.0,"The stand seems sturdy, the base is like a tripod base of a mic stand, so it may hold up better in the long run than my other stands that have the ""clamping"" type of base. The top of the stand is shorter than my others, not really a problem but worth mentioning. The only gripe I could have with the stand is that the top takes two screws and two wingnuts, so it is not practical to use for gigging / setting up / tearing down. I will leave this one in my studio and use the others for shows. For the price, very sturdy and seems to be nice quality."
162,344,3.0,"This is definitely a sturdy and well made stand - I have no fault with it about that. Solid materials, everything snaps and latches tightly. Good materials. Works just like it's supposed to.I have two complaints about it, though.1. The part that holds the music isn't as wide as other stands. I probably could have read the description and realized that, but I made the assumption that all stands are the same size. It's just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper. It will hold bigger things, of course, but the edges will go past the edge of the stand. So it works, but to me, it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges. The ledge is nice and wide, though, so it can hold some pretty thick stuff. But if you are using quite wide materials, especially if they are loose-leaf, you will want to look for a wider stand.2. Adjusting the height and tilt is difficult. To alter the height, one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring (like one finds on microphone stands). It doesn't just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands I've encountered in life. Adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back, which is a bit difficult to reach. Unlike every other music stand I've used that one can simply force into position. The good news of this is, though, that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring, everything stays right where one puts it. No slow sliding down in height, no slow tilting backwards.On the plus side, they are sturdy, and the feet can be retracted (is that the word?) so that they are parallel to the stand, making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy. I love the fact that the feet do this.These are excellent music stands."
635,344,4.0,"Sturdy, portable, and the little extra weight is worth the investment if you ever want to put a music book (rather than single sheet music) on your stand.  Those flimsy, backless music stands are worthless IMO, especially on a breezy evening.  My bandmates are upgrading to this stand as well and we primarily play indoors!  I guess at least one of us is a bit of a windbag."
749,344,3.0,"The music stand is similar to the stands used in schools.  This stand is durable, firm and easy to assemble."
895,344,4.0,"This does exactly what a music stand is supposed to do, this thing is awesome!!! I love it... Thanks forsuch a great affordable product"
1387,344,4.0,"Needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag.  This one fit perfectly.  It's adjustable and allows me to fit a clamp-on microphone boom arm.  Saves space at cramped gig sites.  Don't lose the wing nut, though.  It tends to fall off (since you must completely remove it to break the stand down for transport.  Not worth lowering to 4 stars, though."
748,344,3.0,"heavy duty, pretty sturdy, finish is not the best in the world but it certainly does the job it was intended for, holds secure and adjusts easily"
201,344,3.0,These stands are great for my lesson business.  I bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight.
763,344,4.0,Yea how could a music stand be amazing?  Well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk- this is a godsent.  It actually hold by 500 song fake book (you know the one- that weighs about 10 pounds!). It stays where you set it and works wonderfully.  NO complaints!
254,655,4.0,Works as expected. Clips onto pretty much any mic stand. The movable head is awesome.
139,655,4.0,"This is a pop filter. It does a fantastic job at that. The plastic rings feel a little cheap, but that is just because they need to be lightweight. Ultimately, this is a great pop filter and the goose-neck is very strong but flexible. I would highly recommend this piece, as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close."
25,655,4.0,"Works solid, looks solid, and had a good price. I would recommend it to anyone!I really like this pop filter."
800,655,4.0,"This On Stage ASFSS6 GB Dual Screen Pop Filter performs great and makes me sound professional.  I particularly like the flexible gooseneck, which makes adjustments on target.Also, the filter arrived well packaged and in perfect order.  A well deserved 5 star rating for this affordable product."
1138,72,4.0,They sound pretty good. They tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments.
1028,72,4.0,"Bright tone.  If you have a dead sounding ukulele, as is sometimes heard in laminate ukes, or you want added volume, the Aquila strings are second to none.  There are other wonderful strings (Fremont flouros, Worths, etc.), but Aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound.  If you own a less expensive ukulele (under $300) and it came with ""no-name"" factory strings, or strings known to be of lesser caliber than the Aquilas (strings such as Martin, GHS, etc.), please just try a set of Aquilas, and you will hear a major difference.  There are internet videos showing the painstaking process of making these Nylgut strings in an old factory, owned by a middle aged couple, in Italy.Winners."
31,72,4.0,"The absolute best strings money can buy for a uke.  Installed on a cheapo soprano, they helped a lot, but they won't do magic.  Good luck."
1330,72,4.0,I have a cheap soprano ukulele and it came with plastic strings?  I put Aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good. It is amazing what difference the strings can make. I have 3 ukuleles in different sizes and they all have Aquila strings. Highly recommended.
696,72,4.0,"I only have a low-cost Mahala ukulele so I wasn't expecting much of an improvement when I replaced the stock Nylon strings, (after watching several Youtube videos showing me how to do it). I was wrong. These strings sound much better - the sound is much brighter and &#34;cleaner&#34; than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new. The Aquila strings took about 30 minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods. My ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers. I would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better."
612,72,4.0,"A perfect sounding string!  The crisp ring these strings give is undeniable, they are the best you can get.  Your uke is going to come with crappy strings, change them to Aquilas!!"
224,72,4.0,"My first Kala Ukulele had these strings on it from the factory and I've never switched brands.  Everywhere you read, these are the strings to have!"
299,72,4.0,"What else can be said about Aquila? High priced Ukuleles have them standard for a reason, they are simply the best. Even if you have a very cheap ukulele, adding these strings can turn a toy uke into something that wont embarrass you. I use Aquila and Martin strings in my ukuleles, the Aquila for most performances, and the Martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional &#34;Hawaiian&#34; sound, as the Aquilas are a tad heavier than Martin. Even if this if you only have one ukulele, and you won't for long, you can't go wrong with these strings."
1219,72,4.0,"As a guitar player, I recently (march 2013) started to play the uke.  I bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument.  These string play good and stay in tune pretty well.  I will buy again."
142,72,4.0,Best Ukulele strings I have found to date.  And I've been playing stringed instruments and uku's for quite a while now.  I like 'em.
934,72,3.0,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR THE SOPRANO UKULELE I BOUGHT FOR MY LITTLE GREAT NIECE.  I DON'T NEED TO USE THEM MYSELF.  I ALSO HAVE THE SAME QUALITY STRINGS ON MY BARITONE UKULELE.  THE STRINGS ARE VERY GOOD. IF YOU HAVE A INEXPENSIVE UKULELE, THE USE OF THESE STRING SHOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE TONE OF YOUR INSTRUMENT.  IF YOU ATTACH THE NEW STRINGS CAREFULLY, THE TIME FOR THEM TO SETTLE DOWN AND STAY IN TUNE SHOULD NOT TAKE VERY LONG.."
768,72,4.0,Worth every penny. Great sound and stays in tune. Will definitely make any uke sound great. I replaced the stock strings on a MAKALA DOLPHIN with these and it sounds like a more expensive uke. They are easier on the fingers and stay in tune much better than the cheap strings that came with the uke. Definitely would recommend these.
103,72,4.0,"had no trouble putting them on or getting them in tune,  great addition to any uku bag, i would recommend them."
163,72,4.0,"Fantastic sound -- just trust what everyone on here is saying -- if you buy these strings and slap em on a cheap ukulele, you will have bought yourself hundreds of hours of playing and fun!"
916,583,4.0,"I have one setting that I like, and the only button or knob I use is to turn it on or off. Would never use it to record, but for the price it is 100% an awesome choice! Totally sufficient for a live situation if your amp doesn't have reverb, or you just want to easily turn reverb on or off."
820,583,3.0,sounds great.  Love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks.  It does not work well with a daisy chain power supply.  with this set up the second channel will distort a bit.  Forget batteries. They last 5-10 minutes.  With its own power supply sounds amazing esp when one takes in to consideration the price
533,583,3.0,"My newest amp (the Marshall JVM410 Joe Satriani) replaced the reverb with noise gates...a function I absolutely love. But then I needed a reverb pedal. Honestly, there are more expensive pedals out there, but this will do exactly what they do for a lot less money. Give it a try. I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm extremely happy with it."
376,583,4.0,"I have 6 amps. One of which is a good tube amp, but with digital reverb. It fails to sound right. So. I researched reverb pedals and found the Biyang RV-10 Tri Reverb to be the best in design, tone, and value on the market. I was not wrong. Have had this unit for well over a month now and it still is amazing in how it produces just what was lacking with that one amp's pitiful excuse for reverb.This device, with it's three different reverb settings, is just right for any style music you play. The spring setting is really quite real in how it trails off and that doesn't happen in a digital device. Analog has that warmth that the digital fails to produce. The hall setting is wonderful. Rich, but not too over powering. The A/B switch is kinda a nice touch. Much like a bright switch or a presence enhancer. And the fact that it is stereo both in and out is just icing on the cake.Since it resides on my board, I have grown to use it even with amps I have that are built with good reverb. I'm so acustom to the great sound of the Biyang that I just use it for nearly every amp I own. It's that good."
879,583,4.0,"I sure wish I could afford a Fender Twin Reverb with the old spring reverb...but I don't have the funds, and I don't have the back to lug one of those around anymore. So my Baby Boom does the trick!! It's close enough for my needs!"
233,583,4.0,Didn't want to spend $150 for a reverb so gave this a try. Nice unit. Recreates spring reverb very accurately. Playing through a 333 tube amp and it sounds like the spring amp in my Fender. For the price you can't go wrong.
421,583,3.0,"I ordered one of these bad boys on a whim. It's definitely the best verb it's price range. You can dial in some pretty lush tones.It has a 3 way toggle, that changes it from hall, spring and room verbs.There'd is also an a/b switch that is almost a tone mode. A is bright and in your face, and B is very lush and ambient.Using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb.Also has a blend knob, which controls wet and dry signal mix, and time knob that controls, you guessed it reverb time and amount.Very versatile.This pedal is built with great construction, though the first one I received was faulty. All sorts of popping and weird stuff going on.The 2nd one works flawlessly. Seems very durable, switch and jacks are quality.I highly recommend getting a 1spot or 9v adapter b/c this thing drains batter power FAST, though all modulation pedals do.This pedal does not suck tone, and is true bypass, though I wish this wasn't, as I wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned off.For &lt; $75 shipped I certainly can't complain.If you have any hesitations on the Biyang stuff, I definitely recommend it."
718,583,4.0,Nice reverb. Can get all of the reverb sounds you want. Got to play with it but I got dialed in easy
324,583,4.0,"I've been using it for nearly a year now. I was going to buy the Boss RV-5 when I somehow discovered Biyang. I had never heard of them, but at 1/3 the price of the Boss AND stereo Ins and Outs, I gave it a try and I haven't looked back. The 3 modes are nice. I leave mine set on hall because I've never liked spring reverb, but the spring setting on this pedal does sound exactly like a spring reverb. The decay time in any mode is more than enough for probably anybody, and I can say the same for the blend control. Overall, this is a great pedal with lots of sounds that will suit just about any style of playing. More than enough decay and wetness. Seems well-built. I've since bought other Biyang pedals and I have never had any issues like other reviewers have stated. I'm not ashamed of having Chinese clones on my board. In fact, I highly recommend Biyang whenever somebody asks about it."
1157,583,4.0,"This is actually my first experience with a Biyang pedal.  I heard good things about the build quality, but didn't end up with a Biyang until I needed a reverb pedal.  Turns out that reverb is a relatively expensive effect to find in a compact pedal.  Most of the popular options or $100 and up.At around $59.99, the Tri-Reverb has a distinct advantage in price, but don't underestimate its quality.  As some other reviewers noted, the reverb can get EXTREMELY deep and lush, if you so desire.  I found myself with the ""Blend"" and ""Time"" knobs around 30% for a practical spring reverb.  There's a multi-switch for Hall, Spring, and Room.  There are subtle differences between the three, but I'd be lying if I said they sounded dramatically different.  The A/B switch isn't well explained, but if you're in ""A"" mode, the effect is much more dramatic.  I found that operating in ""B"" mode was similar to the type of reverb I had enjoyed on my amps.  (Note: it has a stereo input and output, but I only use one Input/Output, so I can't comment on that).At the end of the day, it's a fairly simple ""always-on"" effect, and the Biyang does the job without costing a fortune.  But what makes it 5-star worthy in my book are the little pieces of attention to quality.  Having a thumb mini-screw to open the 9V compartment (instead of a plastic door or needing a Phillips screwdriver) is a big deal.  Also love that the 9V jack is on the top of the unit, away from the other jacks.  The pots are smooth and easy to turn, and the mini-switches and footswitch are ""boutique"" level quality.  This is a great reverb pedal - I don't think I'll ever need another one."
57,517,4.0,"I just picked up a Pod HD500 and I love it. Of course a couple days later they announced the HD500x, but it doesn't look like they've made any major changes. Anyway, if you're thinking of getting one, here are my thoughts, in no particular order:*This thing is versatile. You can use it in a number of different ways. Just as an effects board with 8 customized effects, with effects and amp sims, as a midi controller, and as a recording interface, to name a few*Line 6 gave you access to the guts. Everything is tweakable, assignable, and flexible. They trust their users to read the freaking manual. I'm amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs. Want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay? No problemo!*For live performance, this thing would be perfect. It allows you to organize your presets in ""Set Lists"" and name everything whatever you want. You can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves.*While not all the effects are my cup of tea (in particular, some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear) there are enough options to make anyone happy. For example, I love the distortion I get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up.*The built in looper goes forward, backward, half speed, before effects, after effects. Fantastic!* It's built like a tank. Metal exterior, everything feels solid and like it will last longer than I willIf you've got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance, take a look at these and the new 500x version. Just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates (not to mention the amps) would cost you more money, assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones. Truly a great piece of gear!"
1292,517,4.0,"I've had several PODs and have never really been impressed with their tone. Right out of the box, the HD 500 totally blew me away. I know their marketing calls it ""HD"" because of the added tonal characteristics, and it's true - there is a huge difference between the HD series and the older PODs. I can't really say why they sound better, but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older PODs without much tweaking and NO EQing (although one can tweak the tone with several EQs).One complaint with the older PODs (that I agree with) was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone. This is not the case with the HD 500. I've been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work.At first, I purchased theLine 6 POD HD 300because I didn't see the value of the HD 500. After thinking about it, I decided to pick up the HD 500 and compare the two pedals. I definitely think the HD 500 is worth the extra cash, even for a hobbyist such as myself. There are extra controls on the looper, and extra record time. The wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the 500s (I could be wrong, but I DO remember them being different). The dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the HD 500 are amazing. I'm sure I'm forgetting some differences, but I know I'm happy that I went with the HD 500 over the HD 300.The drivers seem to work great on both Windows 7 Pro 64-bit and Mac OS 10.6 (they have 64-bit Mac drivers now). The included software is OK - I get the feeling they are still building it out. It's a bit glitchy but seems to work OK for the most part. The software updater works great and I've already had a couple of firmware updates since I purchased the HD 500 (bug fixes). There is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct ""tube amp feel and behavior"".I nearly purchased the M13 to plug into myFender Super Champ XD Electric Guitar Amplifier, but I noticed the HD 500 had the same number of effects PLUS amp modelling for the same price! I know the two pedals are designed for different purposes, but for me the HD 500 made much more sense. I can use it to practice with headphones, or plug into my amp as an effects pedal. To use it as an effects only pedal, one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup. I also decided to test playing the HD 500 directly into aBehringer Eurolive B215D Active 550-Watt 2-Way PA Speaker System with 15-inch Woofer and 1.35-inch Compression Driver, which may replace my other amps as my primary rig (I get the Behringer today, so we'll see).The build quality over the POD X3 Live has improved. The case is now entirely metal vs. a combination of metal and plastic. I can definitely see this being heavy road/gig worthy. I also purchased aGator GK2110 Compact Keyboard Gig Bag, which fits the HD 500 (albeit very snugly).Overall I'm very happy with this setup, and recommend this amp modeler/effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home (especially with headphones) on a wide variety of musical styles."
1000,517,4.0,"I love my HD500. Got it a while back but have just started to explore it's capabilities. Sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website. There are so many options, I spend hours just experimenting and trying different things. The possibilities are endless. Wonderful. I love it. Am sure you will too. ENJOY!!!"
207,517,2.0,"The Line 6 POD HD500 has too-much compression even with the compression effect turned off.  If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then I recommend getting the BOSS GT-10 and installing BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg."
617,517,4.0,"You'll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum. My own opinion about this is ""I Love it"". I play the guitar privately (not live in public) and I have no complaints at all. I still use it all the time and learn something new everyday."
1119,517,1.0,"For any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. Direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred Amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.That being said, it is good for practice and song writing. Used this for more than a year and finally sold it! That's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out."
996,752,4.0,I needed a new microphone cable due to my son destroying the last one so this decided to invest more in a higher quality cable. This GLS Mic cable is working well. The build quality appears good and should be much harder for my son to break.
203,752,4.0,GLS continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price. I have been happy with all my purchases from GLS to date and will continue to use them whenever the need arises.
69,752,4.0,I've been using GLS cable for years now and I never had a problem with it. They're good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it.

1028,693,1.0,"I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke.  The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand).  My uke does not fit well in the stand.  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke.  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater.  So, most ukes don't fit well.  They fit, just not well.I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required).  Now the ""curve"" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it.  The fit is improved.  Not great but better.  One stand can't fit all instruments, but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars.  This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up, like the video here on Amazon reviews, it is very heavy for its size.  This is not a lightweight stand.  At all.  Surprisingly heavy, and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag, trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand. All Hercules stuff is superb, and my friend has one for his uke and says it's sublime (I don't own it, myself, so I just present this so you can research it and it's reviews on Amazon). I own other Herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one.  Oh, well, for once, I got cheap.  And got burned for it.All in all, not great, this tiny stand.  One stand fits NOT all.  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments.  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all.  It's just an imperfect design. My take on it, your mileage may vary.  Bye bye."
923,693,0.0,"At the time I bought, was $16.  Mine arrived broken, so it had gone back.  Reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken.  Not upset about that - stuff happens.  It is just not a good stand.  Light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped.  The 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck.  So I pick up uke and I get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity.  Happened every time.  Yes, I tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice.  Back it has gone.  5 stars to Amazon's return policy, thouh!"
612,693,4.0,"This stand does its job quite well.  The only problem I can foresee anyone having, is there are no instructions on the proper way to unfold it.  It's not a difficult problem to solve though, so be patient and all will work out.**** Update****I just want to add that the seller of this item went above and beyond, as far as customer service.  I have nothing but praise for them!"
918,693,4.0,"This stand is useful for small instruments..fits my tenor uke and violin just fine.  Any bigger than that, and the piece that holds the neck becomes too small (like a baby martin guitar), etc.  Hope this helps"
317,86,4.0,"I played the Wedding March at my son's outdoor wedding back in April and I needed an amp so folks would be able to hear me.  I plugged in my Martin HD-28 and all went well.  The Martin has an Fishman Infinity Pickup (narrow style) in it and together with the pickup, this amp put out a real sweet sound.  As I said, the wedding was outdoors and everyone complimented me on the Wedding March, so I know they heard me - and I didn't even have to crank up the volume.In my den, when I practiced, I barely raised the volume, else it would have been WAY too loud.  So, in short, I'd buy it again."
835,86,4.0,Do not let the size of this little amp fool you.  I have used Roland and Fender amps and PA's.  I heard a buddy preforming with this with a drummer and bass and went and bought it the next day.  I use it for my small solo gigs.  But it will cover a good size room also.  Great vocal and guitar sounds.  I can't believe what can come out of a six and half inch speaker now a days.  JUST AMAZING.  I have cut the amount of equipment considerably that I need to do a gig anymore. It wont break the bank and it wont break your back.
786,86,3.0,"I am mostly happy with this amp, it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs.  With that said, when I was shopping around for an amp, both online and in person, ALL the amps I tried and read about (both very expensive and very cheap amps) had one characteristic in common, which is missing from this one, and which I thought was universal: it doesn't allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing, I had to purchase a headphone amp separately, wasn't expecting that.This may seem a nit pick, but considering the universality of this feature, you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp.  Other than that, this is a great amp.  I could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it."
1241,86,4.0,"Nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume.  Numerous reviews posted on Amazon, Sweetwater Sound, and Musician's Friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark.  This is 60W mini-PA that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully- if you have a quality mic.  There are 'package' sets with this amp by other sellers on Amazon that bundle cables and mics, et cetera... recommend steering away from that and just buying the amp from Amazon and getting a Shure SM58 (or other quality mic) seperately.Many reviews talk about the durability and how easy the amp is to ding and scratch cosmetically.  I see potential for that, too- thus the need for a carry bag mentioned below.  But I don't see this as a big downer and I personally don't mind if it takes on a road worn appeareance after bumping it a few times.  If appearance is your thing, shell out the extra $200 and buy a Roland or Fender...Shop around... click around... if you buy &#34;items sold from Amazon&#34; you can depend on Free Shipping.  If you buy from sellers THROUGH Amazon you will usually pay shipping and the overall pricetag will be bigger.  And as I've stated on other reviews, other sellers that sell through Amazon sometimes ship slower or make mistakes with shipping... so know that going in.  On your major music retailers' sites this baby is going for $360 to $380.  Got it to my door for $304.  I really can't say enough about the ease of shopping, trustworthiness, and quick delivery of items sold by Amazon.  5 stars just for service... the fact that the Amp is awesome makes it that much better.You probably won't be able to find a carry case that fits this amp, but I bought the 'Singer Black universal Sewing Machine Tote' for just over $20 and it's perfect.  It fits the mini snugly, with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals.  With my current setup I can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands, and that's really neat.  The closest 'amp case' would be $100 1x12 combo case that won't fit right and would take away from the whole portability thing.You're not going to find 20 lbs and $300 worth of quality amp anywhere else.  When compared to other makers (Fender/Roland) nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets, and I understand why.  Recommend without hesitation!  And as with all my reviews if something goes wrong down the road I'll edit the review to share.  But I expect that this amp will meet my needs for a long time to come..."
143,86,4.0,"Now, this is one GREAT piece of kit. Two chanels, 60 watts RMS (real power), and super control over the sound of each channel. Only complaint? IT'S BUH-TUGLY! Sickly brown... cheesy looking. If she was my prom date, I'd put a sack over her head (yeah, well, not that I'm another George Clooney or anything)."
857,86,3.0,"Acoustic guitar amps have more in common with stereo systems than traditional electric guitar amps: neutral full-range sound (rather than crunch & distortion), high power ratings for clean tone, full range speaker system with woofer and tweeter and sensitive preamp inputs optimized for the low output of piezo pickups. Unfortunately for me, acoustic amps tend to be optimized for steel-strings and rarely get classical guitar tone right, even with dial diddling. As a dedicated nylon-string player, I'm always looking for the holy grail of amps. Is the Mini sent from heaven?PIEZO TONE: I jacked in my Takamine LTD2012 Classical and Hirade TH8SS (classicals with Cool Tubes preamps) and with tone controls set flat and had my ears pinned back with shockingly powerful output. The master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular. Unfortunately, that big sound wasn't natural and sounded closer to an electric guitar than a classical: big bass, bright lower trebles, weak mids, quacky tone and compressed. Obviously, under-saddle piezo pickups are no studio mic but it should sound better than this. So I diddled the controls and it improved a bit but I couldn't dial in a pleasing tone. The best timbre with my Hirades was bass-11:00, mid-3:00 and treble-9:00 (clock face orientation).Some acoustic guitar amps allow the tweeter to be disabled and I suspect the Mini's overly bright tone would benefit from cutting that little guy from the circuit. As a point of comparison, Cool Tube piezo pickup tone from my 21 year old Trace Elliot TA50R is much more natural, complex and sustained. Cool Tube piezo tone from my SHEN-CPK-8T is drop-dead gorgeous. Perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and de-piezo the tone? They cost more than the Mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow.I plugged in my mid-1990s Trace Acoustic TAP-1 preamp into the Mini and was able to dial in better tone, albeit still not as good as my ancient TA50R. I also tested my Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. and it rendered more natural classical tone. So you can get decent classical guitar tone if you're willing to carry another box to your gig.REVERB: The single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter and harsher sounding, even when mixed in sparingly. Wish this amp had an effects loop as any budget half rack unit will sound better.MIC TONE: I don't normally use a mic for casual gigs but this is feature is handy when you need to mic a friend or blend in a small internal mic for extra ambience. The Mini lacks phantom power so I installed a battery in my Shure 849 condenser mic, set tone controls flat and was greeted with surprisingly natural mic tone. I also tried my ancient Shure SM57 dynamic mic with similar good results, albeit that mic needed a little treble cut. As a point of comparison, the Mini whips my TA50R good in terms of mic output and tone.APPEARANCE & BUILD: The Loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures. And it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my TA50R. If you drag it to gigs you'll find the exterior delicate: the vinyl material and underlying wood are easily damaged by gentle pressure from straps and carts. It's the most delicate amp I've owned.FINAL BLURB: My feelings about this amp are mixed. For value and use as a wee PA it's a 5 star deal. For under saddle pickup classical guitar amplification it works but is far from natural: compressed dynamics, bright lower highs (even at full treble cut) and the dreaded piezo quack. So 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction. The Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. or similar acoustic guitar processor does significantly improve tone, but that's another 2 or 3 bills. Unfortunately, straight out of the cardboard, the Loudbox is not ready for for primetime nylon string reproduction. I suspected the Mini was optimized for steel-string guitar tone, so I borrowed a friend's Takamine EF341S and I was right: steel-string reproduction is significantly better than nylon-string. All in all, the Mini packs a lot of punch for 3 bills and just may be the best buck to tone ratio deal for a novice coffee house artist."
1085,880,4.0,"It definitely changes the sound of my Classical Guitar for the better (Pavan TP-30).  It allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonics/partials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental.  My initial thought was that it did away with the ""blurriness"" of the low bass to mid-range response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitar's range.  Amazing what a $20 piece plastic can do.  Highly recommended."
246,880,3.0,"Actually, it was really easy to install..i just losen 6,5,4,3 string and just put it in and it was over!i felt volume coming out from sound hole is bigger than beforebut tone, i don't know.. maybe im dumb enough to not notice"
165,880,2.0,"I use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there. It was a pain to take out, too. However, it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar. It did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall. I had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole. Something you might want to think about before getting one of these."
417,880,4.0,"For years I have fell more and more in love with my Yamaha CGX-111SC. Stil, nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo (note: change to a better piezo system, LR Baggs are great!), high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes. I wanted to experiment with this item... result: GREAT!!! I finally got to listen to what I use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments. The sound is richer and clarity makes unique."
1256,880,1.0,"Let me first start off with the sizing. When they say ""Fits Soundholes from 33.75"" - 35"""", they really mean it.You are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16"" smaller than the specifications.I know I did. My friend's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. The edges did not ""catch"" completely  and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.However, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me, that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened. Does it matter? In practical terms, no, not for this sort of item.I guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies."
964,880,3.0,This is great but I needed an actual sound-hole cover.  I bought this along with the Planet Waves Screeching Halt sound-hole cover.  Though only using it for a short time I did notice the bottom end seemed more focused.
298,880,4.0,"While the sound improvement is not huge with my guitar, it didn't need to be. When it comes to music, it is&#34; that little extra&#34; that makes the difference. The Planet Waves O-Ports gives me that extra. I have no doubt it will continue to please me for many,many years to come."
1153,880,4.0,"This does what it says it does. Anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole. This is easy to install, I just losened the strings and inserted the o port. My Washburn D-30S will never leave home without one."
622,880,2.0,"I installed one on my Larrivee D10E which created a more focused and pleasing bass response and reduced feedback when amplified. I then tried one on my Breedlove Custom Revival OM with poor results. I believe the Breedlove's inherent bass response conflicts with what the oport is supposed to accomplish. In both cases, I had to cut slots for my pickup controls which takes a little time and care  to do neatly. I think , for 20 bucks it is worth a shot, but don't expect miracles."
1240,880,2.0,"- Put this on a Gibson J-45. It did increase the bass (OK, as that's not a J-45's strength) but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have. Also took off a little of the finish on the sound-hole when I removed it.- Tried it on a Martin D-28. Nope. The bass got muddier, which is definitely the *wrong* way to go with a Martin.- At this point, was going to return it, but finally tried it on a small body. Now THIS worked GREAT. Louder, focused and projects much better - almost resonator-like. Fantastic for slide or capo'd high. That's it's home now.So...An O-Port can help a guitar that needs help - a small body or cheap guitar. In my sample of 2, it made high-end guitars sound worse. If you can't afford a better guitar, may be worth a try. But, be careful, as it did chip off some finish on at sound-hole."
476,880,1.0,"Perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. As strictly an issue of natural acoustics, I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-made Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D-42. It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a ""sound canon"" for it's great natural volume. Adding the O-Port deadened the lows. It just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. It is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. But again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person ""voiced it"" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. The O-port seemed to ""corral"" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. Sorry to be a crab about it--I like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the ""Humidipak"" recall a few years back. But this product was a waste to me."
1248,880,4.0,Very pleased with this item.  It really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom.  Definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole.
15,769,4.0,"GREAT WORK MAT FOR ELECTRIC AND ACOUSTIC GUITARS AS WELL AS BASS AND STAYS AT MY WORKBENCH.  HOWEVER, I NEVER LEAVE IT ROLLED OUT UNLESS WORKING ON A GUITAR, TO MANY OTHER STRAY FRAGMENTS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT FLOATING AROUND IN MY WORKSHOP AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FALLING ON MAT THAT COULD POTENTIAL SCRATCH ONE OF MY BABIES!"
1000,769,4.0,"I used it to whenever I am changing guitar strings and whenever I am tuning and intonating my Fender Strat. The surface is perfect (no rolling away of screws, no scratching of the guitar shiny finish, perfect)"
1175,769,3.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect, and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down, especially when I took it from the plastic. Very strong fumes, not too pleasant, but they dissipated in the basement overnight.Because of the fumes I was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish.  I was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours.  I wouldn't leave it on anything ""finished"" for longer than that because this type of foam doesn't last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove.  For now, it's great.It comes with a black nylon, sort of mesh tube shaped bag, good for putting it away or traveling.  For now I will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn't curl so much.  For the size and utility, the price (which goes up and down) seems reasonable."
584,769,1.0,"I thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they won't slip around. maybe i should get that for cheaper.I accidently bought LARGE, ooh boy is it; like, windshield sun reflector size. Sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose."
295,769,4.0,The mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance.  It is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar.  Spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat.
757,769,4.0,I use this for working on my guitars mainly. It does the job well and is pretty large. It's very soft and padded as well as anti static.
1125,856,2.0,It works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up. It eats batteries like nothing this size I have ever seen. The swivel ball socket broke and I had to glue the arm into the remaining socket. Hmmm.
756,856,4.0,very awesome item. really useful for tuning. haven't had any problems with it at all so far. Looks very nice
830,856,4.0,"My friend has commented on its bright color - ""you'll never lose that thing!"" I hope he's right cause I love this little tuner. Works well and easier to read than many of its competitors."
227,856,4.0,"I have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetish.com which works well.  The Snark is a bit larger (only an issue, really, if you don't like having something clipped to your headstock) but it's much easier to read, and it's very sensitive and accurate (according to my ear, anyway).  Easy to use, picks up the note very quickly, and the colored visual indicators are so easy to see, even in bright light, which can be an issue with my other one.Also, someone made this point in another review - this thing can be a great training tool to learn the notes all over the neck. It picks up the note very quickly, and so it can be used very easily for that purpose, as well."
6,856,4.0,"the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners I have found, I have both the the SN-1 and SN-2 for my guitar and mandolin respectively, when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on, if not sure which, get the SN-2 (red) one it generally will work for all instruments."
898,856,4.0,"Very very useful.  Like seriously, unless you are very very good, you can QUICKLY get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear."
1257,856,4.0,"I bought this just to see what everyone was raving about.It's all true.This tuner works great!It is better than my Intelli 600, which I also like.The colors and lighting make it very easy to read.It has no problem with the low E string. Obviously more sensitive.The Intelli works, but sometimes you have to move it around to find a sweet spot for the low E.As with the Intelli, it is not affected by ambient noise.The only thing I find worse than the Intelli is the gooseneck. While it is very adjustable, the Intell folds flat which I really like.The Snark is well worth it's small price!"
420,856,4.0,One of the best tuner's out there!!  It was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order!  Very happy with this purchase.
484,856,4.0,I bought it for my violin I was a bit reluctant because I uses vibrations to tune and I was hoping not to get something useless. Its been great so far. Its easy to use I clip it on my violin and tune I like to keep it on while I play to make sure I have my fingers in the correct spot as it shows the note I'm playing.
481,856,4.0,Has worked very well so far.  Need to make sure it is extremely quiet area when you tune but has worked well and easy to use.
166,856,4.0,great tuner! it is very simple to use and the articulating head allows me to see better while tuning the guitar. i will buy another one of this.
226,856,4.0,I've had the same tuner for years. I decided to upgrade. I got this because it had alot of good reviews and it was fairly cheap. It tunes better than any tuner I've ever used. Worth every penny!
656,856,4.0,"I used this on my bass, which up until recently I was trying to tune by ear. I had it close but it's the fine tuning that really helps. This tuner really opened my eyes to how much even being a little bit off can change the sound. I am a beginner so you gotta cut me some slack on that one. But the tuner was a snap to figure out and I had my bass tuned in less than a half hour."
264,856,4.0,"Awesome tuner ! spot on tuning , very bright display and super fast and easy to use ! this is a must have"
170,856,3.0,"good product, good service should be fine for years to come...i have one in my main guitar caseses..always close by. enjoy"
691,856,4.0,"Accurate little accessory only works with guitars. It seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with. Only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar. I don't know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments, or for uses other than tuning."
1223,856,4.0,This was for a friend who plays guitar. He used it several times and said that he was satisfied with the results.
234,856,4.0,"I have nothing but good things to say about the Snark SN-1.  Accurate, easy to use, clear display, and much smaller than I anticipated, yet it's quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar.  At home or on the go, I can't see the need for another tuner."
821,856,4.0,Very useful.
1193,856,3.0,"...even a kid can use it with a guitar. I received 2 in a kool metallic-blue, but as far as I know you can't choose the color and it is bad because a match with the instrument is kool.My perplexity (this is why the 4 stars) is generally on electronic tuning, it happened to me that different brands gave a slight different tune, while 'all' should be perfect and perfectly the same... creepy isn't it?What we do now?  I do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune ...better go back to the diapason?"
808,856,3.0,"It does a good job for the price.  I have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat, and this really helps."
556,856,3.0,"Easy to use, Seems to be well made. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish the built in Metronome made a noise you could hear as you play. Having to look at the beating heart while you play is very difficult."
511,856,4.0,This Snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use (even for my children) and works well. The display is easy to understand and is very accurate (confirmed by our guitar teacher's meter). The Snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish.Everything should be this easy to use and work this well!Highly Recommended!CFH
1094,856,4.0,I see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts.  Much more fun than a black box. I own one of each model.
34,856,2.0,"Although I didn't purchase my Snark SN-1 on Amazon, I wanted to share my excellent customer service experience about a company that clearly cares about its customers. I had a problem with my Snark, and the company displayed first class customer service -- exceeding my expectations. The SN-1 is a must-have as far as I'm concerned. I had been using my iPhone until a friend recommended the Snark tuner. SO much easier to use, and I like the logical incremental LED display that shows if you're flat or sharp. On my iPhone, the app I've been using doesn't always display the frequency when I'm really out of tune, so I have no visual indicator of where the tuning is at. If I had a better ear, no problem, but such is not the case.Snark not only shows you with the bar display, but also displays the notes your string is playing. Much easier -- you don't need to select your tuning or anything first. It picks up your frequency on whatever string you're on and you simply dial it in.Great, sturdy clip with a well thought-out foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric. I usually just leave the Snark on my music stand where I can use the visual metronome. You can also just clip it to a nearby desk. Buy this with confidence -- you'll love it.******************************EDIT: Although I still love this little tuner, my model has suffered a few issues which I will address here. I'm not certain if it's a design flaw or not, but the little plastic pieces that serve as the socket joint on both ends of the adjustable ball arm have a tendency to snap off. I think the manufacturer should look into this and perhaps design a single ring of plastic which may have more integrity. Also, the rubber feet fell off long ago with very moderate use at my home. The electronics themselves have held up admirably."
1236,856,4.0,"I bought this as a second tuner for gigs. It is awesome!Easy to use, easy to see. Simple, inexpensive.Get one! You will not be disappointed."
562,856,0.0,"There is a problem with the design.  When you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off.  The tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes."
1033,856,4.0,does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating
1388,856,3.0,"Even though I have a tuner in my pedalboard setup, and one on my iMac via MainStage 3, the Snark is indispensable. It's perfect for those times when you don't want to drag out a bunch of gear, and just want to noodle around, even without an amp. I use this little guy for electric guitars, and could see it being perfect for acoustic guitars, as it barely takes up any room at all in a case or gig bag."
118,856,4.0,"Love the very fast tracking,  So convienient to have a cheap but amazing tuner on each of my guitars!  For $10 bux each,  why not???  The screen articulates so there is always a perfect view,  I am finding myself making much more minor adjustments to my tuning than I used to just because its right there and so convienient,  so my playing sounds better than ever before simply because I am always in perfect tune now!  Way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet, finding a expensive 9 volt battery, selecting a note you want to tune and  waiting for a needle to stop moving on  my crappy old tuner.  Just an amazing product,  I even clipped it onto my piano and bought a $30 set of tools online and saved $100 tuning my piano myself!!!"
1013,856,4.0,"I've owned a bunch of tuners over the past 30 years and this one is the best I've ever had for an acoustic guitar.  It is easy to operate, has a nice large display that you can easily see and it's small enough to carry anywhere.  It is fast, accurate and the battery seems to last forever.  Nothing to complain about here, 5 stars all the way!"
1021,856,4.0,I have about 4 different types of tuners and this is the best of them all. I have small kids and birds around the house so many tuners get lost with the noise. This one works off the vibration of the guitar so it is right every time even with a lot of noise around.
140,856,0.0,"For some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right.  It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway.  I have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right.  Then I recheck with my other brand and it's not even close.  Maybe I just got a bad one?  I like that this one shuts off automatically..but again, it's WAY off tune.I did like the style, size and color.....but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire..."
918,856,4.0,"I wonder if all these Snarks, no matter whether they are 1 to 12 , have all the same frequency ranges.  I have them all, and they all work great!"
376,856,4.0,"Been playing for five decades now. Used to tune with a tuning fork. Then later, used a Boss TU-12 for years. Now the Snark comes along and the Boss tuner (reliable and true) sits in the bag with other accessories I use, but it has no need to come out. The Snake took it's place.No need to unplug from the amp, and then plug the tuner in. Fast and easy. The readout is easy to see in any light. Working off the vibration of the string via the guitar makes this an accurate tuner, as some pickups will have too great a signal for a standard tuner and give a false reading. Not with the Snark. Small. Handy. The list goes on, but I think you get the point. It works well. Very long battery life. Easy to see. Oh, and did I mention ACCURATE??? Yeah, I think I did."
553,856,4.0,"I use this for my acoustic primarily, but sometimes for my electric guitar.  It is accurate and easy to use."
1170,856,4.0,"I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems. The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars. This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot."
1204,856,4.0,"this is the 2nd tuner like this that I have purchased.  it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar.  the battery lasts a long time as well, which is not true with all little tuners like this one.  all in all I am very happy with this purchase.  small price to pay to be in tune.  I would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable, inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument."
750,856,4.0,Snark tuners are great! They are very accurate and are very inexpensive. I have three of them so I can keep one in each guitar case.
129,856,4.0,This thing is awesome!  I think it's the best tuner I've owned and it really does an excellent job.  It's easy and clear and everything a tool should be.  It's fast and easy just like a tuner should be.
1359,856,4.0,"Really love this product; works well, helps me stay in tune quickly, is helping me to train my ear to ""hear"" when I'm in tune."
1182,856,4.0,This was a requested gift from my teenage son for Christmas and you should've seen the smile on his face that day.
498,856,4.0,Just what I needed!  The display is easy to read and easier to use.  My old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult.  The many colors of the Snark makes tuning quick and easy.  A definate must for any guitar player.
102,856,4.0,Very good tuner and I love that it attached to the instrument and you can leave it there. I wholeheartedly endorse the product.
117,856,4.0,"I am absolutely delighted with this tunner.  One comment, my son has one also, the neck of his broke so he warned me.  I am always very careful when turning the &#34;head&#34;.  I can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen.  As far as tuning goes I am very pleased.  I moved from a guitar to a harp so I am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful! Plus: my vision is not the best and this one I can really see!"
278,856,4.0,"I purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100% accurate and very easy to use.  His guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use.  I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner.  He connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp.  If you are a beginner or seasoned player I know you will like an appreciate the tuner.  A must to keep in your bag especially for beginners, a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on."
809,856,4.0,"This is the best invention since the wheel, as far as I'm concerned. It's easy to clamp onto my guitar head, and the frequency/not readings are quite accurate. It's incredibly easy to use and very handy when re-stringing a guitar."
804,856,4.0,"There are a TON of reviews here, and I don't have a lot to add. You can read about what this tuner does and does not do in the specs section or from other reviewers who tend to review specs instead of how they like or dislike something. Bottom line, this is my favorite headstock tuner. I also own the new NS mini and it has its own qualities that I like as well (like being small), but it doesn't fit on my Godin's headstock. This tuner, the SNARK, fits on my Godin's small headstock with no problems. On a dark stage this works great. I love this little tuner. five stars."
879,856,4.0,"I've heard about the Snark tuners before, and have seen them once in awhile, but while skimming the music side of Amazon I finally picked this up...and it works GREAT!"
576,856,4.0,"i love this tuner so much! the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back. it works so well though, and i knew i'd have to buy a second one since i'd never see the first one again."
1117,856,4.0,"Great value. Works well, tunes tight and is CHEAP. When the battery is run down, the screen darkens but it still works. What more is there to say."
403,856,4.0,"This snark thing is the cats meow, its absolutely Charlie. It hears things I don't and tells me whether they are what I want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together.If you like being in tune, this is probably for you. It is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything. You can clamp it on a cat's tail, but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don't even think about doing that you sicko.Great design, easy to read, works better than 2 other brand tuners I own. only bummer is you can't carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one. If it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars, oh well.I suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool, hip, out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity.  oh the peer pressure........"
852,856,4.0,This thing works great.  Tiny and seems to be accurate.  The price is darn good as well.  A must for all guitarists.
470,856,4.0,What can I say-I love this thing.  I bought three more after trying the first one.  I put one in each of my guitar bags-can't live without it.  The tuning is excellent and so easy.  If you are hesitating buy it and you will love it.
112,856,1.0,"First time I tried to use it, it broke in my hand.  It is now taped together, while I wait for a different kind to replace it."
344,856,4.0,Works amazingly so far. I am definitely proud of this product. Will be buying more in the future. Great Buy!!!
236,856,4.0,"I used these on all my instruments, guitar, mandolin, and violin.  It works fine and I would recommend them at this good price."
1060,856,4.0,"I love these clip on ,vibration reading tuners, This was the second one I tried , The first was a Barcus Berry, which worked equally well, They both have lots of features, such as tap tempo, up and down tuning adjustments. With the Barcus Berry, it was the first one, after trying the Snark, which is a cool name and a lot more colorful, I tuned up a brand new guitar in a store , out of the box in less than 2 minutes, never came close to doing that before. That convinced me, the Quicktunes I had been using were accurate, but these seemed to be better, and get you perfect, I have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments, which makes sense, they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric.From the literature it, seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals, that have been raved about.Hello, Raving bout this. I seen on Amazon they are cheaper, I bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for 19.99, here they are around 10 to 12 bucks. These type of tuners, especially the intellitouch are popular wih Bluegrass folk like me, The grapics on this are great , no more shaky needle, just a dead on still reading when you are perfect."
1212,856,4.0,"We attach this cute little tuner to the head / top of our guitar neck and tune our guitars... GREAT tuner. It goes with us when we travel with our guitars. We've played with other musicians who have used our tuner, and they have all commented, &#34;What a great little tuner.&#34;"
793,856,4.0,"For a while I had the SN-5 tuner. But I bought this one and I'm glad a did. It's fast, accurate, reliable. The product picture can be a little deceiving. The color is a a metallic blue (almost navy). It's got some good features although I don't use them. I'll use nothing but snarks!"
340,856,3.0,"Excellent price. Excellent tuner- with one flaw. Using it couldn't be simpler, and it has excellent contrast. I would say it was the best clip-on tuner I've had a chance to use, except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal. One of the little fingers that holds the ""ball"" in the ""socket"" on the back of the tuner broke off, so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces. This model works only by vibration unlike the red one, so without the clip, it is not very useful (it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it, but it isn't very convenient). I would just super-glue it together at a good angle, but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments. I've seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem, so I would call it a design weakness.Despite the negatives, I would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case.Update 4/4/13: Added back a star. I'm still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer. Even with a slightly compromised mount, it continues to provide excellent results. I recently purchased a replacement, the SN-8(B), but found it really disappointing. So much so I may send it back. I also tried a Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner, which no matter how much I try, I simply cannot love. So I just ordered another one of these. Despite the ball socket issue, it is still one of the best tuners I've ever used. For the money, I can afford to keep a couple on hand."
84,856,4.0,"I love this little guy. Clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you, it will still accurately tune the guitar. Very easy and simple to use. I paid $9 for it and it is 10 times better than the $40 one I have."
279,856,4.0,I had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought I was doing a good job. After I used the Snark my guitar sounds so much better. I will never be without one again. The snark is easy to use and shows you positively when the guitar is in tune.
1206,856,4.0,These tuners are amazing! I like them so much I bought another one. They work better than tuners costing ten times as much!You don't have to be a rocket scientist to use it. It's so simple a child can use it. The face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark. It is extremely accurate. This is so much better than my Intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what I paid for the Intellitouch. It's very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without. It uses one CR2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included. You have to install the battery which is no big deal. Just read the instructions. I recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too!
211,856,4.0,"I had never owned an electronic tuner before, but have used the large models and the iPhone apps.  This is a great product.  It is easy to use.  Adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument.  I haven't banged it around, but have had no problems with durability.  Bright, easy to read display.  I would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike."
35,856,4.0,"I bought one of Snark's ""Super Tight"" tuners and found it to be less then advertised. It will get you in tune, but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less. I am going to buy another so I have one in the studio, and one on my stage rig. Buy it. It's a great little tuner!"
364,856,4.0,wonderful price and great product. Buy it! Love mine and have recommended to every musician I know. Works great and love the colorful display.
334,856,4.0,"This is really quite a fantastic little gizmo.  It functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick, simple, and fun.  It is easy to read from any angle (it adjusts every which way).  You just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations, showing you when you are sharp, flat, or dead on.  Quite amazing, especially for the price.  Highly recommend (and I'm stingy with my 5 star reviews)"
875,856,4.0,It does know when your guitar is in tune! Does it for you so you don't have to do it by ear.
679,856,4.0,"I noticed an immediate improvement in my playing as this tuner, above all others I have tried (Korg, Intellitune, etc.) brings your instrument into dead-on 'ringing' true tune across the instrument. I use this on my Fender Stratocaster, Gibson Les Paul Custom, Fender Telecaster, Fender StratAcoustic, and Takaminie Classical. Works equally well, meaning phenomenally well, on all of my guitars. With all of the features, capo tune, visual metronome, acoustic as well as vibration tuning, plus calibration... This is one tuner you won't want to be without, and, the only one you need."
1303,856,4.0,"I really like this little tuner is is maintenance free, small light and easy to use.  Highly recommended for the price."
437,856,4.0,This is a great tuner for the price it looks slick and is a quality.product whether.u r a beginner or in a band this tuner will meet all of your needs.
543,856,4.0,"I have used these type of clip on Tuners for quite some time and have 4 different brands.The SNARK however is absolutely THE BEST clip on tuner I've seen on the entire market and the price isperfect. They've come out with the SN-8 I hear, which I'll buy soon..Great Product..Don't leave home without it."
105,856,4.0,"This tuner works great, easy to attach, turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string, is as easy as one two three."
1284,856,4.0,"There's really nothing I can add to what's already been said about this tuner.  I teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner.  I took a look at it and knew I had to have one too.  This tuner will tune chromatically, so you don't need to buy a special tuner for that.  I can use it on my guitar as well as my guitarlele which is tuned a 4th higher than the guitar.  I chose it over my other chromatic tuner the night my daughter was to play guitar in her school's talent show.  I needed to be able to tune her guitar accurately and quickly despite all the noise in the large room.  It performed fantastically!  (And so did she!!!)It's soft and rubbery feeling and won't scratch your guitar.  The reading are easy to read: red light you're flat, green - you're on pitch and yellow - you've gone sharp. It reads almost instantly.  My other chromatic clip-on tuner had some trouble with the D and low E strings but this tuner seems to give me a pitch quickly.I like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it."
182,856,4.0,"This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it. You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work, which is pretty cool. You don't have to hold it or put it on your leg. Also, this is very accurate and gives only a slight range to be in tune. It is a  great product."
868,856,4.0,"I popped the included battery into place, fired it up, clipped it to the head of my electric guitar, and it worked seamlessly.  For the price, this is a great deal!"
1031,856,3.0,"Very, very good tune result. It really put yout guitar in tune. But the arm is so fragile. It has broken 2 monthes after the purchase, so i had to repair it manually with glue. I recommend."
605,856,4.0,"I'm a semi-pro player, and this tuner is all I need.  A great buy, worth the money.  The simplicity of the design and the beautiful full color screen are my favorite features of the Snark Sn-1."
1152,856,2.0,"This tuner is nice , inexpensive and very easy to use.  It does a very nice job keeping the instrument tuned"
1423,856,4.0,I have tried several different kinds of guitar tuners and of the ones I have tried the Snark is the best. It is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier. I highly recommend this tuner.
597,856,4.0,"Solid tuner, more accurate than I anticipated and very easy to use. It will get you extremely close and for the size and functionality it seems to be the best product of it's kind that I've used."
772,856,4.0,the snark tuner is theBEST one I have owned  extremely accurate  easy to use  very reasonably priced for such a good piecehave paid lots more for products that were harder and not as accurate
1116,856,4.0,Excellent little device for the money.  Easy to use.  I have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well.  This will get you in tune for $11 or less - can't beat it.
346,856,4.0,"I own several of the Snark tuners.  The SN-1 settles quickly, and works with a wide array of instruments.  Tuning couldn't be simpler.  Just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and, in an instant, there it is.  The display is bright and easy to read, and the graph has a lot of resolution.  The SN-1 senses frequency through vibration.  It is transposable, and it offers a metronome feature.  The SN-1 is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful &#34;electric blue&#34; color."
1427,856,3.0,"I like the way the Snark attaches to all of my guitars and a mandolin. It reacts quickly and is not over-sensitive. The way the mounting and dial articulate make it easy to set up while not interfering with the tuning knobs. Easy to read and for the very low price a great value. However, and this may be my own fault, I often need to snap my finger against the dial to get it to start reading. I say my own fault because I put the battery in wrong the first time and had to pull it out with needlenose pliers. That may have damaged a contact. I play with a number of other people that have Snarks and they all work properly. I would buy another one without hesitation."
74,856,4.0,Since this my first Snark SN-1 Tuner I am very pleased with performance it gives me accurate read outs against built in tuners on the guitars (Acoustic) that is. Like all all functions it has looking forward to maybe upgrading to the next model or so just have a few around for each instrument.
993,856,4.0,"If you are a beginning guitarist, like myself, you probably can't tell one note from another. This product does all the hard work for you easily, quickly and accurately. The only thing I needed to know but didn't was that if you get a reading of G and you need to make the reading B for the B string, the notes follow the alphabet from A to G and then begin again. So you are turning in the right direction from G if the next note is A. The one after A will be B. Seems simple enough if you know anything about music. I didn't."
238,856,3.0,"This is a great little tuner.  Used it for more than a year with no issues.  Fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar.  It also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are.  The only reason I didn't make this a five star rating is that I discovered the Planet Waves PW-CT-12 NS Mini Headstock Tuner.  If it was a choice between the 2, the Planet Waves wins, hands down.  But this is excellent for what it is:  an easy-to-clip-on tuner that can be used on any instrument.  I've even set it down on my elementary classroom autoharp and it tuned it to perfection."
721,856,4.0,One of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune.  With this little gadget there is no guess work.  Clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune. I love this little gadget and the price is super on Amazon!
621,856,2.0,"I have to edit my once five star review because twice in a row I recieved a tuner in the mail, and after less than one week the screen goes totally dim. I Can't imagine this is the battery since that is supposed to last a year and I only used the tuner 4-5 times for less than a minute each time. It's so dim I can barley see the reading when I squint. It's only $10 just a pain to wait two weeks for amazon to give a refund. I'll be buying another one and trying it again! Good tuner, unlucky with two lemons I guess."
322,856,4.0,"This is the best clip on tuner out there.  It's dead accurate, doesn't bounce around like dial needle tuners, and it's EASY TO READ!  You just clip it to your headstock, either acoustic or electric, turn it on, position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly.  Highly recommended for all string players, especially electric or acoustic guitar or Dobro.  There are other tuners by Snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges, so check out what suits your needs."
634,856,3.0,...but what you ask? This tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily. Mine broke and so did my friend's. It's probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to get a replacement clip.
1046,856,3.0,"Not quite as good as the red All Instrument Snark, but it gets the job done and the price is right."
240,856,0.0,Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it.  The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless.  I will try to get a replacement... Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need.
44,856,4.0,"The Snark SN-1 is small, accurate and easy to use. I have a more ""sophisticated"" tuner and the Snark works faster and is much easier to use."
615,856,4.0,"I've been playing for over 30 years and now have three different electronic tuners, so I'm a good judge of the Snark:PROS:  It's chromatic so it's good for every tuning job; no need to plug it into your jack; ambient noise doesn't affect it; great sharp, colorful display; reacts quickly; small enough to fit easily in my case; cool blue color; built-in metronome; powers down automatically to save the battery; transposes up to four steps if you're using a capo; will even identify major chords.CONS:  Works better on acoustics and semi-hollows than on solid bodied guitars; made me realize that three of my strings need intonating (or is that a PRO?); metronome is visual only; manual says that long-term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars' finishes; big blue thing on your guitar looks weird.Now that I have the Snark I have officially retired my other two tuners.  This is easier to use, easier to carry around, you don't have to unplug from your amp, it works on acoustic or electric, and it's chromatic.  And it's cheap.  Definitely recommended."
103,856,4.0,"so cheap I bought one for each of my ukuleles..  would never use a pitch pipe again, and I guess I might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these."
845,856,4.0,I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it.  I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantastic.Easy to use and very accurate.  It makes tuning a breeze.
1233,856,4.0,"At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner, but since I've been using it for the past few weeks, I've yet to have one complaint. It sits right atop, clipped to the guitar, operates on vibrations, so doesn't pic up other guitars, is light, barely even notice it, and seems quite accurate."
519,856,4.0,"Bright easy to read display, adjusts to face any direction, so I can even use it with my Telecaster which has very little room on the headstock.  Accurate and fast. Can't beat the price, and battery compartment is easy to open, unlike some other tuners I have."
1201,856,4.0,"Started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the DVD's and books, and my teach used a clip-on tuner and my interest went sky high. (I am a professional drummer with serious guitar envy)All I can say is GOODBY JACK-IN TUNERS.With this little baby it makes no difference whether you are playing an electric guitar/bass or an acoustic, and you can tune on the fly with the thing clipped on to your headstock all the time. Admittedly you can do this with with a jack-in tuner without the jack-in part, but the results aren't always that good, and you have to fish around for the tuner.The whole turn the amp down, unplug from the amp, jack into a tuner, unplug from the tuner, plug back into the amp, turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicing/playing the guitar, but those days are over. I need to keep my enthusiasm level high, and actually play the guitar instead of fishing around for a tuner.As far as accuracy, it is as good, or better than any jack-in tuner I have (I have three different brands)."
496,856,4.0,"I have no complaints except when I try to tune my guitar a half step down, there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but I have zero clue how to use them. This tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head, swiveling head, visible from wherever you are."
190,856,4.0,"This tuner is great, and it being so low price makes it even more better, standard shipping took 2 days to reach me in Mass. I was pleased for that. The tuner comes with a 2032 (circle) battery, and its as simple as pushing the power button and strumming the guitar strings. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend. I'd buy it again. Its a nice little tuner, and my guitar is sounding great. This is a very well made product."
609,856,4.0,"I bought one of these at a music store like 2 years ago for 30 bucks. I was Impressed and used i to tune my guitar, bass and mandolin. Later I saw them for 8$ here on amazon and I bought 1 for myself 1 for a sister and another for my brother in law. These are a great deal. I can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud! It just uses vibration of the instrument."
554,856,4.0,"These tuners (including the red version) are the best. I have many tuners, from expensive Peterson and Boss, Korg, Seiko, Quiktune, and many other brands, from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons. The Snark is the easiest and most stable to use. Even my young guitar students, who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that I love, have no problem tuning with this tuner."
1229,856,4.0,"I am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar, but I purchased this SN-1 to replace the piece of junk first tuner I had. I'm very happy with the size of the SN-1. It's small, much smaller than I expected which was a big bonus. It takes up very little room on the headstock, and does not interfere when I make tuning adjustments. The &#34;chip-clip&#34; style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I *think* my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner.The user interface is very simple, and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions. The instruction manual is adequate, but the SN-1 seemed very intuitive for me to use. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I've had this SN-1 for a couple months now, and will update this review down the road. Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do the best I can to answer.SPO"
883,856,4.0,I had to tune my guitar and I bought this. Well it works great. I got the sound I wanted.
20,856,3.0,I tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both. I didn't think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp. It appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner. I would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet I don't know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner.Update: The more I use this tuner the more I like it. It is easy to read and use and doesn't appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was. Of course I am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used.
760,856,4.0,I had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s*** im gonna by me one lol
114,856,4.0,"When this arrived I didn't realize it was that small. Thought it has to be so its out of the way. Then I thought, this thing can't work very well, but it does perfectly. The first few times a used it, I wasn't expecting muchhowever, I couldn't more wrong it really works well and I would recommend this to family or friends."
90,856,4.0,"I was surprised by the size...very small and unobtrusive. My older guitar has a decal on the top of the head which made the small size a bit of an issue, but with the cleverly designed swivel pad and wide opening on the clip of the Snark, I could still easily manage it.The tuning is dead-on, and couldn't be more convenient. Since it's based on vibration, the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise. Also, you don't have to try and balance anything on your knee or use a table to hold your standard audio tuner. Just clip it on and swivel the head to face you.I really like the design. Attractive but not overly loud in color, and a nice non-slip surface. The display is bright and the interface is very intuitive...you just press the button and start plucking strings.In addition, Snark's customer service was very friendly and helpful.Putting my two cents aside(that anyone who plays the guitar should learn to tune by sound, without a tuner, given one of the notes), I highly recommend the Snark tuner."
505,856,4.0,Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try. For the money I figured why not.GREAT little tuner. Dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners. This clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use.The face pivots around and the display is nice and bright. I will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases!
68,856,4.0,This tuner is easy to use.  I have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn't seem to be perfect on pitch.  This tuner is and I am very happy with this purchase.
929,856,4.0,"not much to say, if you play guitar buy one, you'll never be out of tune again, lets you tune anytime, i never even take mine off, no more ""does this sound in tune"" because it will always be in tune, so do your self a favor and go out and buy one, very affordable (you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hours)so enjoy"
639,856,4.0,"I have seen people complain about battery life. I turn it on, tune, and then turn it off and my batteries last forever. The display is good, and the tuners work well. I have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity. I think it is a well made product and good value. Thank god for tuners. There is nothing worse than a bunch of out-of-tune, loud guitar players."
894,856,4.0,"I've got a bunch of these little tuners- I keep one with each instrument. They are a little tough on batteries, but they are accurate, even picking up notes below E on my double bass C extension.Highly recommend!"
566,856,3.0,Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice.  This device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy.  Why you would almost think I know what I am doing.
836,856,4.0,This was a great purchase.  My son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford.  He would definitely purchase from here again.
1311,856,4.0,"I've tried the Fishman FT-1 and the Tune Tech ttm-201.  I like this one the best.It seems as accurate as my other tuners.  Like all clip on tuners there are ""sweet spots"" on the head that work better than others.  Oddly the Snark likes different spots from the Fishman or Tune Tech.  I tested the Snark against them, my Korg tuner and my Android App tuner.  The Snark was fine.The biggest plus I see on the Snark and the reason its my new ""go to"" tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen.  My vision isn't so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful.  I don't have to guess or squint.It has a metronome which can be fun.  I personally don't use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so I don't want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when I really need it.The only minus that I can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce.  I don't have a custom made Brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing.  If you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you'll trust it.  If not then the Fishman is more your speed."
838,856,3.0,"Tuner works well with acoustic but not so great when your electric is not plugged in. Seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound. Sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit, and it's okay. I also have the NS Micro, and that's a better tuner."
1053,856,4.0,"I bought this because I got tired of looking up by-ear tuners online. It's so darn simple to use. Just clip it on, tap the big button, and play a note. The chromatic tuner is extremely easy to read and incredibly simple, and it automatically recognizes which notes are being played and adjusts to the note as you tune up and down. It was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners. Overall this is an amazing product and I don't see a reason why I would ever want another tuner again. I've had this tuner for about a month now and it hasn't failed me yet, though sometimes it can be a little stubborn and slow with determining when a note is being played and it does have a habit of being right on the mark one time, then if you pluck the string again, it will show it's off tune by a quarter-step or so. Just make sure you tune all the strings twice, and you won't regret buying this tuner."
1011,856,4.0,"works right out of the box.  Easy to read, easy to use......arrived very fast inexcellent shape....just had to put the supplied battery into it"
582,856,4.0,"I have several different tunes, but the Snark is hands down the fastest and most sensitive. Has no trouble whatever picking up the low e-string on my Seagull acoustic, which flummoxes my Intelli 600. Having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier. The only down side, and this is a matter of taste, is the garish color. You shouldn't leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark, so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away, which may be just as well."
1202,856,4.0,i got this as a gift for the my guitar mentor and lead guitar player in my band.  i have a tuner built in to my amp i use but he has always tuned by ear which is hard to do on stage or even at rehearsal.  the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it.
294,856,4.0,"A great little tuner. Very accurate, easy to use and the batteries last the better part of a year. I bought 3 or 4 of these and I put in my gig bags or cases. At these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments."
926,856,4.0,These Snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick. I use the mic instead of the vibration setting though. That's my preference. But I would use no other tuner on stage. I have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars. I have dozens of guitars!
163,856,0.0,"Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that. If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!"
765,856,4.0,"Awesome little tuner, very accurate and I can store it almost anywhere. much cheaper online too, for the price its a steal."
1108,856,4.0,"this tuner is awsome,it tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner."
1092,856,4.0,I haven't had to change the battery on this bad boy in over two years since I've had it!  It also is bright and is very accurate.  If looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further!
177,856,4.0,"The tabs broke off right out of the package (the other reviews made me aware this may happen). An easy fix with some Super Glue and for the price, who cares if I have to fix it. It is 100% accurate and very easy to use. Other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money. Highly Recommend!!"
310,349,4.0,I use this tuner to tune up my violin.  Other tuners I've tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the &#34;E&#34; string vibrations thus making it hard to tune.  This tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings.
40,349,4.0,"This little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments.  Just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds.  I've even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch.Pros:- Dead-on accurate.  You can easily set your intonation with this little monster.- Works great in extremely loud environments.- Clips on tightly.  If you don't jump around like an orangutan on stage, you could probably have the Snark ride your headstock through the whole show.- You don't have to plug into it.- Extremely responsive.- Enough display detail for you to know when you're getting close to in tune -- not just 3 indicators like some tuners (flat, dead-on, sharp).- Very inexpensive.Cons:- A little twitchy on the open low B string on bass. I use the 12th fret harmonics (first partial) to tune, however, since it's a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more, so this has never really been a problem for me.Inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case -- for every instrument you own."
54,349,3.0,"I bought this to replace the inexpensive Musedo T-50 tuner that came bundled with my Kala KA-S ukulele. The Snark SN-2 is much more accurate, but its LCD display is not very bright, and has a narrow field of view. (Yes, I did try a fresh battery, but it made no difference.) I wish it were brighter and easier to see. Still, it's a very good tuner overall."
658,349,3.0,"The tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks. It may be my imagination, but I think the recent ones work a little differently than previous generations. They seem to register differently than older ones and sometimes give you a tuning that is just a wee bit sharp.I have used them to tune many different kinds of string instruments, from autoharps to mandolins to guitars. It works with all of them.Tuning by vibration is very useful in a loud room, but it is not always perfect. If another band is playing loudly, the sound vibrations from the speakers will affect your ability to tune. So you have to wait until the band is between songs to get an accurate reading.To my taste, the display on these SN-2's is the best of all the Snarks. I like the extra bars and the smoothness of the way the display zeroes in to the perfect pitch. It looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes.Finally, do not drop these. The head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily. It has a ball joint construction. That is good, and seems to hold up to use. The plastic socket, however, on the back of the tuning head does not respond well to hitting the floor, even a carpeted floor. I do not treat my tuners rough, but it is easy to drop them. When you do, 6 out of 10 times, the plastic socket will break. I have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base. They still tune, but I have to hold them against the guitar. They do not clip on any more, so it is inconvenient."
1154,349,4.0,"I thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk. Because well these days you usually get even a little less than what you pay for. But this tuner destroyed those expectations. Its a small, ""smart"" tuner. So many functions and just a great design. Its really cool that I dont have to go hunt down a tuner that could be lost in my room somewhere. This attached to basically any guitar, or almost any object for that matter. The only thing negative I have to say is, im not so sure you can plug a cable into it. Which you would expect with ALL the other stuff it comes with. Otherwise, its pretty great."
286,349,4.0,"This is just the tuner I was looking for! It works on vibration or mic, so it's very versatile. It works on my acoustic, bass, electric, and my mother's voice. Haven't tried the trumpet yet... Intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see!"
348,349,4.0,This tuner is very accurate.  It is well made and stays on without falling off.  I tested it with other tuners and it's right on. Easy to see when positioned correctly.
1,349,2.0,"It is bright, easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so ""fragile"" at the base.  The battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base. I like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic. Be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off. It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own. Would I buy it again? I don't know. Going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate. Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way."
150,349,4.0,"This is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner.  The Vibration Mode is really good. I am a new guitar player, and this item has helped me greatly in quickly tuning my guitar."
405,349,4.0,"This has got to be the best little tuner I've ever owned, and the cheapest too.  I have a $100 tuner that works nicely, but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to.  The SN-2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the SN-1 doesn't.  So I use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there's no place to clip it.  I highly recommend it."
1358,349,4.0,This is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use. It's easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone. It's easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not. The only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes.
725,349,2.0,I've owned four of these over the past two years and after 6 months of light use (4-5 times per week) the first two malfunctioned. What I mean is the screen became so faint you could hardly see it and putting in a new battery didn't help.  My current one I bought in July and so far everything is holding up. Knock on wood!  They are cheap .....so I guess you could look at them as a disposable tuner but you'd better have a back up cuz they break when you least expect it.
903,349,3.0,"I bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp (I play guitar).  She has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome.  I was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for her.Unfortunately, it doesn't fit on top of our harp.  The tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp.  It does, however, clip into the sound hole okay.It tunes the harp fairly well.  I only had problems with the top 3-4 strings which I had to pluck a bit harder for the tuner to pick up.I also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly.  (Clipped it to the top of the headstock)Tracking is very, very good for a tuner at this price.  I was able to play the strings, tune them, and watch the meter follow the note.  Display is very easy to read and lights up nicely.  I was tuning in a dim-lit room and was able to read it perfectly.  I'm sure it would be great on a dark stage.The only other drawback is that the display needs to be positioned within a certain range.  Otherwise it gets a big hard to read.  But positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily.4 out 5 only because of size (not fitting on harp as I hoped) and display legibility depending on angle (I had to reposition it maybe 2 times in order to tune the whole harp)."
1370,349,4.0,"Easy to see, Easy to use, Easy to get used to.  The display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound, that is what makes it so useful.  You can't beat the price for such a great little tuner.  Amazon as usual makes ordering, paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience.  I will be buying one for every guitar case I own."
1090,349,4.0,I bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was. Easy to use and handy for ANY string instruments.Only thing i regret is not getting one sooner.
63,349,4.0,"There are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well. Before this I had been using tuner pro android app that also works well but I don't have it all the time.There is one big negative, it is absolutely useless outside in the sun or even shade. Can't even tell if it is on or off. Outside of that I am glad I picked the ""red"" version instead of the others."
565,349,3.0,"The tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode. The screen could be a little brighter. Otherwise, no complaints."
1029,349,4.0,this tuner is great best buy works so well I highly recommend this Tuner can't buy a better tuner for less money
108,349,2.0,"I've been using the snark for a year or so now, and I always have the suspicion that it's just telling me what I want to hear - that my guitar is in tune, when in fact, it's not.  The other day I had to go from standard tuning to DADGAD, and had about 1 minute to do so (plenty of time) but after the tuner said it was in tune, it was time to start playing and it was, well... noticeably out of tune.  After checking each string multiple times!  Very frustrating.  I guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy.  If you want something that usually puts you in the ballpark but may betray you when it really counts, then go with the Snark.  It's better than other clip-ons I've used, but still not cutting it in my opinion.  I play a Taylor 414ce.  A plus side is that you can buy a five-pack of batteries on amazon for 2 bucks - shipping and all.  You will need them sooner than you think :)"
1094,349,4.0,"The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow.  This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately, exact, easy to use, fun to look at.  There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better."
1028,349,4.0,"I'll just say, newbie to ukulele, no idea how to tune it, instructions online say GCEA, I put this on the head, plucked each string, tuned the machine head until it said dead on, and that was it.  I keep this clipped to my ukulele standInstrument Stand for Violin, Ukulele and Other Small Instruments(see my reviews of it, it's so so, the stand), and just turn it on and tune the uke before I take it off the stand.  ONly time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts, I find them a bear to buy, but time will tell.  Anyhow, I concur with the reviews on here, glad I listened to them, and for any brand new ukulele players out there, this is the one to get.  C ya"
31,349,3.0,"If you play a string instrument, this one is a must.  I have several and a Snark for each one.  Unfortunately, in the span of about two years, they've gone from about $6 (in bulk) to about double that.  It's a good product, but shop around wisely for the best price, and hint:  read the fine print, if they include a battery, you'll pay lots more.  I even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store. Five stars for performance, take away one for greed. And another comment in 2013.  I decided to buy 4 more, but went to another source which only charged ONE shipping price, not 4."
61,349,3.0,"I was shocked when I got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was. For the sake of letting you know its compatibility, I have used this to effectively tune an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, a mandolin, and a 4-string bass. That's a huge range for any tuner! I've had older versions of clip-on tuners and this one just works faster and better. Recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges. The ones made for guitar have limited range, but are cheaper, but I would imagine they're just as accurate.I'm not a huge fan of the red color, it is really bulky and noticeable on all the instruments I've had, but I'm happy with the trade-off. I just wish there was a smaller, more discrete option or something in black or a more muted color."
111,349,4.0,"I've used electronic tuners for a long time.  Most of them that I've owned you have to plug into your instrument.  That means they don't tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument.  I bought a Korg GA-30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago.  I used that Korg until getting the Snark.  The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasn't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason.  Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in it's day.Enter the Snark SN-2.  This Snark will tune about anything.  It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or don't clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone.  Clip it to a music stand, clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar, upright bass, violin, saxophone, trumpet or even a tympani.  Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources.  It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to.  It senses the entire scale.The Snark SN-2 has a well lit, clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness.  The display pivots to any angle.  It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock.  The battery seems to last a fairly long time, longer than the 9-Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per month.Long term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clip-on tuners.  I've only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile I've had no issues at all yet and it still works good.  I don't think you should drop it very often.  So far I've dropped mine once with no damage.  Even if it did break, 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurate.While long term durability is undecided I can't complain at all about the versatility, accuracy, high visibility display or the low cost.  I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar.  It really gets around and tunes them all.  The color is sort of a metallic red, almost Candy Apple Red.  I ordered spare batteries but haven't needed to change one yet.I'd buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that doesn't have one.  I'm sure they'll use it often.  This tuner is a real good buy at a good price.  Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon, so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so you'll be prepared.I've never used the metronome feature other than to check it out.  It flashed a locked tempo but I really don't need that feature."
1419,349,4.0,"I purchased this to use with my old Yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele.  It works great on both, very accurate and easy to use.  The swiveling head works very nicely and makes it easy to see at any angle.  It appears sturdy, and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument. I haven't used other tuners of this type, but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price."
1272,349,4.0,"I like this tuner as much as my SN8. It's accurate, fast reading, and has the added feature of  acoustic mode if you need it,"
393,349,4.0,"I received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping,it looks great,  the price is right, but most of all it works wonderful, very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case."
210,349,4.0,"I bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo, it works good on all of them and is very accurate. I also used it to tune my uncle's mandolin for him because he couldn't find his tuner. Other than that theres not much else to say :P, I haven't used the metronome so I can't comment on that."
1410,349,4.0,"So easy to use.  Just clip it on and ta-da!  The screen is very easy to see and tuning my banjo is a breeze with it.  Unfortunately, my dog thought it was a delicious toy and mauled it beyond recognition so I need to buy another one.  If your dog loves toys, keep this out of reach."
1147,349,4.0,"I had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acoustic/electric. I was so used to the big klunky ones that you balance on your leg while trying to tune, I had no idea these even existed. After using it to tune 10 different prospects in a row, I decided to buy one on the spot (the tuner that is, it took another hour to decide on a guitar).It is very easy to use, the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment. I like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there's a drop-D song, or just tweak something that goes out of tune.Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it stays out of the way."
1267,349,4.0,"I first used the Snark when I borrowed a friends before a show, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. He used it to tune his acoustic electric, and at first I thought it was working off of sound, but then I put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric, and it picked it up instantly, and tuned it perfectly. I couldn't beleive it. I had to have one. I ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning, and vibration tuning, as well has having the tap beat metronome, and I am in love with it. It's SO sensitive, and so accurate, you can turn the mic off, and use it to tune your electric guitar in a VERY loud room, and it won't pick up ambient noises. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. I recommend this to ALL musicians. The mic feature would be useful on your music stand, or attached to your trumpet, tuba, saxophone, whatever... clamp it on, and play. Absolutely awesome."
28,349,2.0,Works fine. It is of course difficult to tune when other's are playing around you. I found the mic tuner isn't as accurate. Also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily. It is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too.
1359,349,4.0,I am impressed at the thought that was put into the design of this product; I bought one for my daughter and one for me; great deal for a great product!
487,349,4.0,"This is the second one i buy and i love it, is small, fast and accurate , best of all, you don't need to have the volume knob open for tuning, i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive, but it feel quality and does it job perfectly , my friend love it above all the other gift, it is a everyday use tool for a musician."
1408,349,4.0,"I was using my iPhone and line 6 input but having to plug in can be a drag when you're no where near your gear. But hands down this is the most accurate, easy to use, and most portable tuner ever. I use it for all mu guitars, bass, mandolin, banjo, etc. I bought two more, you will love this tuner."
613,349,3.0,"This is a great tuner, I just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since I mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars.  Other than that, works great I like using it."
959,349,4.0,I wanted the version of this device with the built-in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar. Maybe I should just change the guitar pitch to my off-pitch singing and I could finally achieve perfect harmony! I like everything about it especially (I think) it's ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life. A well designed device.
102,349,4.0,"Love the Snark SN-2. Works well on my bass, and does a beautiful job on both acoustic and electric guitars. Tight tuning and easily used. Very good product overall, not to mention the reasonable price.Buy it."
532,349,4.0,It does what a guitar tuner should do.It simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning.I do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that's about half price. Better deal if you don't just buy one and have to pay single shipping.
1014,349,3.0,"Easy to use, portable, cheap.  Not exact in tuning, might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican.  For most of us this is more than adequate."
1117,349,4.0,"I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases. Bright display, easy to use, works well and cheap. I have bought several of their models. I particularly like the fact that when the battery is dying the display becomes darker but the unit still works correctly. I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries. Had a problem with the pivot joint breaking on one of the older models, but it was replaced without a peep by the manufacturer. Newer models seem a bit beefier."
70,349,4.0,"I wrote a review for the SN-1 which is essentailly the same tuner except this one also has a mic.  Here is my other review:I own a few tuners, including a Boss Tu-70.  Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT-1 clip on tuner. I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss.  The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use.  But now I have to say, I think the Snark is a little better. I bought the SN-1 and the SN-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate.  The other great thing is they are chormatic, so besides being a great tuner, you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine).  I love the colors and the matte finish too.  The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners. The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too, I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo.  The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs it...it's a no brainer."
236,349,4.0,I highly recommend these tuners.  They are the best I have found for Fiddle and Mandolin.  They also work well with acoustical guitar.
690,349,4.0,"so this was my first real tuner, its very simple to use. great tool and has two different modes which is cool."
867,349,3.0,"Great precise tuning with the SN-2 versus the other Snark versions. I would only go with the SN-2. But...like all the Snarks, they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint. Treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart."
132,349,4.0,"Wow. Very cool gadget, and well executed. This review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks. I have not tried it with other stringed or non-stringed instruments.The thing is quick and accurate. The display colors are bright and easy to read. It does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing. (In fact, if you play a chord, it will usually guess the root note of the chord.) It clips on easily and firmly. It is very sensitive. I find that I have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work. But I can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune, usually without having to pluck it again before I have it right.As an added bonus in my case, the color happens to be a great match for an Epiphone SG G-400 in Cherry Red."
1042,349,4.0,"For 10 bucks it's a great piece. Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass. Battery IS included, but it is very small and almost lost it."
404,349,3.0,"This is my second, after breaking the last one's neck! The plastic socket around the ball & socket joint couldn't take the stress in the gig bag... I'll keep this one by the music stand,"
953,349,4.0,"I have several tuners. one is an inline tuner, one built into my amp....etc... This is my favorite go to tuner. It's fast and accurate. Every one in my band uses this tuner. It works for guitar and bass. It's easy to read and dead on...."
987,349,3.0,"I really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use. However, it broke not too long after I bought it. One of the connections broke, that is. I think they might have made it a little more durable since then. Moreover, I sent it in and they replaced it, so that was cool. It would be nice, though, not to have had to do that."
452,349,2.0,"It works really well for tunings other than standard EADGBE.  I am still trying to get it tuning in standard, but so far it's pretty accurate.  I know it can do standard tuning, i just can't figure it out."
396,349,2.0,"I haven't read a lot of comments about these guys breaking, so maybe my wife and I are just ham-handed Shrek wannabes, but we have busted two of these little gizmos. They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument, a round frisbee shaped tuner, and an arm that connects the two. The arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into. She and I have each busted one, doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floor.While the tuner works well otherwise (except the low E string on a bass which can be problematic), and the things don't cost very much, it's a shame we keep busting them. I do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable. Just be extra careful handling them."
1363,349,4.0,"We've been only using it for two days, and so far so good. I cannot say anything about durability for now, but I'll update this review if it breaks.====One of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU-12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin, and I finally bought this for her.There are many clip-on tuners, but I liked the following about this tuner:1. LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you're off (as opposed to just flat or sharp).2. You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic. Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway, but a mic sometimes comes in handy.3. Can set different pitch than A=440.4. Not expensive (was less than [...]$ including shipping).Upon delivery I tried it on my guitars (both acoustic and electric) using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid, and was impressed.It is quick to track the note even for low E. It's not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on. No stress whatsoever, indeed it's just as quick and smooth as my BOSS. LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected.It worked very well on violin too. And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun.And a note about the looks. From the picture I expected it to be ugly, but actually it was not that bad. It's tiny and doesn't look like a Fisher-Price product.====First update, Nov 24 2010: I've tried it on an electric bass (4 string), and it worked equally well. Still 5 stars.====Second update, Oct 20 2011: It's still working happily for my daughter, and I bought a second unit for myself. Fantastic product."
627,349,4.0,"I have 7 of these bad boy tuners and I love them. I keep them clipped to each of my guitar heads so they are always ready if I need a quick tuning to that guitar...Good quality, accurate and not expensive...Highly recommended and 5 Stars."
983,349,4.0,"This chromatic clip-on tuner is the best of the best.  One cannot go without having one for the price.  I've tuned violins, guitars and ukelele's with it.  This is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without.  You can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments.  If you have it on the MIC than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wish.This little instrument tuner does everything.  FOR THE COST ...YOU JUST CANNOT BE WITHOUT ONE."
3,349,4.0,These are great!  They're small.  Light weight.  Easy to read.  Accurate.  Inexpensive.  This one offers an additional feature:  Tap Tempo Metronome
451,349,4.0,"Extreamly easy to use, you can tune any instrumet witn this.  The display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark.  You can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument.  The price couldn't be better, I just can't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists."
573,349,4.0,I have been in need of a tuner for far too long.  I was turned on to this and I was truly blown away.  The tuner is very accurate and compact.  I leave it on my guitar all the time.  The clamp is strong enough that it will stay put.
960,349,2.0,"it works well and gets the job done but the battery dies way to quickly, other than that its has a cool clip that lets it be placed anywhere"
736,349,4.0,"I have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners.  They all work fine for me.  However, the Snark SN-2 just has the edge. It's performance, look and feel are great!  The added features are also a plus.  I use the Snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar.  It's my go to for chromatic tuner.  Highly recommend this."
99,349,4.0,"There really does not need to be a 10 page review that breaks this thing down to every tedious detail. This is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar, and tunes it in perfect pitch. For a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat. These are a staple on every single guitar in our band! Bright and easy to read!"
1103,349,4.0,"This is without a doubt the best guitar tuner I have ever used.  I have been playing for years and have owned many tuners, this one is the best and I purchased it at a better price than it was offered at my local music store."
1375,349,4.0,Tunes by sound or vibration thats all i use it for the vibration mode is really nice. buy one its convenient
891,349,4.0,I love this tuner. It measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone. I find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord I want to play next. I can sing the note into it and then I know which chord I want to play next!
1205,349,3.0,"I've played guitars for over 40 years, and I've owned or used many, many tuners - stompbox, rack-mount, etc.  This is a great tuner. I bought a clip-on tuner about 10 years ago when they were first becoming popular.  It was ok - fairly accurate, very convenient, but it's sensitivity would make it difficult to tune the low E.  This Snark is much better.  I compared it to my Boss TU-2 (which is the standard stompbox tuner of gigging musicians), and it's just about as accurate.  The fact that it's chromatic means you can tune to any note, which is useful for non-standard tunings. It even has a built-in mic for situations where you can't clip it on (say, for a lap-steel guitar).  The head swivels to just about any position, and its sensitivity allows you to tune in live situations when other instruments are playing.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that because of its curved ""arm"" it's a little awkward to pack for traveling - if you were to cram it into a space and there was some pressure on it I could see the arm possibly breaking off from the spring part. So, to me, outside of that (and the fact that it only comes in red so far), it's perfect."
678,349,4.0,"I'm a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices.  I play guitar, mandolin and ukelele.  And this inexpensive tuner is the best one I've ever used by a long way.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  It has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone.  The dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles.  And it has the fastest and best response of any tuner I've ever used.  It doesn't require a loud volume to ""hear"" the tone.  Finally, it doesn't seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played, but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone.  If I detune by about 1/16th of a turn on my tuning machine (an difference I can't hear with my own ear), this device detects it immediately.  All in all, this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning."
1342,349,4.0,"This tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone, or direct plug in for electric instruments.  This has the microphone feature, but is better used with the clip on vibration mode.  Just clip it on to your guitar head, and hit the string.  A multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat.  Easy to use."
390,349,4.0,It is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments. It works better than my piano. I can trust that I will be in tune.
322,349,4.0,"OK, it's a tuner.  But.....it is dead balls-on accurate, quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight.  Great for gigs in that you can tune and re-tune during performances with fast, fast accuracy.  I own 5 or 6 of them, one for each guitar, and I highly recommend them over ANYTHING else."
429,349,4.0,Works well - but be careful when swivelling the display as it can easily break one of the four tabs it clips into.
490,349,4.0,"Handy, well made, small, easy to see.  Great for guitar, fiddle, mandolin, dobro, and other instruments that it can clamp to."
1046,349,4.0,"This tuner is cool. It picks up even the lightest vibrations, i/e: I can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out. I also like the capo tuning feature. You put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x. I highly recommend this tuner."
450,349,4.0,"I tune by ear and the old fashion way, but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing.  Great tuner."
602,349,4.0,"The design of this product is innovative and excellent.  I haven't used it for as long as I would generally like before writing Amazon reviews of purchased items, and so cannot testify to its reliability, but suffice to say that, for the price, it would be hard to beat.The display is very clear, and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous.  I wonder how I ever lived without it before.For live gigs playing electric, I would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable, as noisy environments probably wouldn't be ideal for this tuner.  This is more for your parlor acoustic setup."
103,349,4.0,"Like it better than the other tuner I bought, this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again."
1089,349,4.0,"This little tuner is so easy to use and see...I bought two more as presents. The price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner. If you don't have a tuner or are looking for a new one, you NEED this one. A+++"
496,349,4.0,"I had the SN1 Guitar Tuner, this one the SN2 is actually for all instruments if I'm not mistaken and it works great. Never fails. I love the red, the swivel head, the green.red lights when tuning. Just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it"
1190,349,4.0,i think this is the best tuner i love it it really works and its really easy to use it
554,349,4.0,"I love these things. I have purchased several Snarks of all different types. Fast, accurate and a joy to use. My young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one. All Snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner. The SN-2 also has a built in mic for use with any instrument, such as trumpet, sax, clarinet, etc. I have other, more expensive clip on tuners, but the Snark is by far my favorite."
1315,349,2.0,"UPDATE: 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning, but MAN, are they FLIMSY.All of my other musician friends- who also LOVE this tuner's ability to grab the right pitch- also have employed copious amounts of super glue to re-attach the neck and clip to the body of the tuner.So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars- EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity... combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itself.Sigh.It's such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends... only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer.If SNARK fixes the problem, I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating... but until then...and I LOVE this tuner... 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.Boo.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. But so many high reviews couldn't be wrong, and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gamble.Really glad I tried it out!The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot. No more chasing pitch for me!Haven't needed to use the vibration/ mic option yet, but I am sure that will come in handy at some point.Planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well.Definitely recommended!"
49,349,4.0,I got this after seeing many of my church friends using them.  I got this one so I could use it to tune my guitars a ukulele and a violin.  It does all of them well.  I'm going to buy a couple more as gifts.
351,349,4.0,This is a great tuner. High quality construction. The tuning is accurate. The controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read. It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously. The Fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate. These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing.
998,349,4.0,I can't believe what you can get for the price on this one.  Tunes all my instruments fast and easy.  The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever.
202,349,4.0,"I love this little device:The colors of the display are a nice touch (red on the left hand side and green on the right).The color of the device.The interface is great and the clip works well.It's very accurate and I love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord (versus being hard to read).A very attractive price.  I bought two.  It would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it.  And it's so cheap, it wouldn't matter if you lost it."
1192,349,4.0,This device has really help me. I am new at trying to learn. I have a long way to go.
572,349,4.0,use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon't leave home without itbut take and extra button battery
1394,349,4.0,I am a novice guitar player.  Arrived in 2 days!  Does exactly what it SAYS it'll do...right out of the box!  Correctly tuned this VERY OLD guitar for the first time in YEARS!
81,349,4.0,Exactly what I expected. A quality tuner for a low price. Very durable and gets the job done. Great buy!
1082,349,4.0,These sell for about $20-25 in the real world.  I paid a bit over $12 and it was an Amazon Prime purchase too.  The display is better than most I've used (dating back 30 years).  The best thing is that I can pass this around to band members quickly when they have a need too.
558,349,4.0,"My mother ""plays"" the guitar (I am a banjo/mandolin player), and the Snark SN-2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days.  She opened it up, got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn't been in tune since... I dunno... and she LOVED it!  lulz  This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory, both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup.  I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note... and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN-2 had a mic.  One less accessory in the little bag now.  :DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function, however... its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat, but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo... mmm, I would still highly recommend using an audible metronome.Side note, if you have friends/family that play a string instrument, be aware your Snark SN-2 *WILL* be making the rounds."
555,349,4.0,This is the second clip on tuner I have bought. This is much better than the other brand I have. It's easy to use and see. The colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite. The built in tap metronome is a cool idea. If you're shopping for a tuner give this a try. At less than $13 it's a fantastic buy
497,349,4.0,"This is a very versatile tuner!  I use it all the time to check my instruments, and keep things sounding good.  Highly recommend this product."
699,349,4.0,I like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. The red color is a metallic color - and I totally dig it. The display is nice and bright as well. Super accurate tuning. Well worth it for the price.
191,213,4.0,"I purchased this item sometime in August, and think it's pretty good. I have not had any problems with it; Not that I can remember. Pretty simple, it does what it's supposed to do."
1347,213,3.0,"Price is Right for entry level. Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings. The Mic mount was a PLUS, using it for one Karaoke ""Cheap Mics"" It is just pop-riveted on so a Bit LOOSE, but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars! Still for the money a great buy..."
682,213,3.0,This tabletop Mic Stand works. Well designed and made from descent enough materials. I would buy again when I'm ready to replace the one I have or add to it.
740,213,3.0,"This is a very well built stand, even with its slim design, which also comes with a nice carrying case. Very good for light, portable set ups. Also holds a big mic, if you position the legs right; completely open with the mic parallel to a leg. That said, do it wrong and plunk. Will not likely stand up to a gusty wind, so use it indoors only. Paid $7.99 for it. Would give it 5 stars, but I know user error, will cause a less careful person, to crash some mics. Good for kick drum and cab mics, by the way, anchor it down with a sand bag, if using it for this purpose."
1225,213,3.0,"It was my fault not to check out it's measurements before purchase. But it's not the reason why I drop by one star. The reason is it's not designed properly.Since people stand and sing, this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than 6 feet. I'm 5'11'' I can barely reach the microphone when I stand still.Also, it's way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a PC mic.As a result, I feel I'm  either too tall or too short...Build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten. Overall a four stars product IMO."
676,213,4.0,This was so inexpensive I couldn't pass it up.I needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactly.Folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag. I just toss it in my gig bag and I'm always ready.[...]
192,213,3.0,"I use this short stand for mic'ing my guitar amp cabinet. It is pretty small and on the edge of ""light duty"" but I wouldn't call it cheap or crappy. The adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably. I don't use it for gig'ing so it isn't getting beat on but it seems to be a pretty good mic stand and the price was great. I also purchased a ""musician's gear""  [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018TC7BW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title ]similar mic stand which was a few dollars more, I think I prefer the musician's gear unit becuase it's a bit beefier than this one but I still like this stand and it was a great value. This unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some. Both are perfect for home recording and practice studios, likely even hold up to some gig'ing."
655,213,4.0,I you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand . This is it. Tripod legs are stable and also adjusts up and down to about 15 inches or so.It even comes with a case with two zippered sections. One for the stand and and one for a mic. There is also amic holder. What a find. I will probably get another.......
294,213,4.0,"Works great. It's lightweight but VERY stable, even with a heavy bass drum mic.A great bargain for a very sturdy, useful product."
70,823,4.0,"I was afraid poor quality would come with the low price, but I did an AB comparison with one of my expensive oxygen free, yada, cables and I could not tell a difference.  I was playing an American made guitar through an American made tube amp so this was a legit sound test.  I'm sure the plastic on the ends of the plugs will not last as long as a more expensive cable...but who cares...buy a new one!  Love the coil, love the price."
1323,823,4.0,"this a great cable for practicing at home. Coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles. This product measures approx. 28"" coiled, plug end to plug end. Thus it is pretty short, even when stretched out. For me, it is the perfect length for at-home use, especially when using two (amp --> pedal board --> guitar).not sure why it isnt available for order on Amazon anymore ... I just ordered mine two weeks ago."
252,823,4.0,"I bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar.Since the peddle board is right in front of me, the coiled nature of the cord keeps me from getting tangled up.What surprised me was how it improved the sound? I hadn't thought that a cable would do this but I've since been told that I'm not the only player that has noticed this phenomena. It's beyond me how this works but I can hear the difference so, I'm changing over to all coiled cords."
1178,823,3.0,I really like this cable! Maybe it's not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine. I keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away. It probably stretches 10-12 feet if you really need it too. What I really like is that it's compact and I don't have cables laying all over the floor.Overall it's a solid cable for practice. I'll buy more.
303,823,4.0,"I bought this cable long with my epiphone les paul special II and the Fender Mini Tone Master thinking that either one did not come with a cable. The epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days. The curly cable has fared much better. No problems, works great and doesn't tangle so it stores easily too.Great as a primary or backup cable. Buy one, it's cheap!"
504,823,3.0,"GOOD POINTS: [1] This cable, unlike many other coiled cables I've tried, does NOT add noise when it's moved. I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it, and it made no noise at all. [2] It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap, making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end. As a result, the cable does not slip out TOO easily; the connection between jack and plug is quite secure. BAD POINTS: [1] The package it comes in says it's a 20-foot cable. Not even close! Holding it up by one end, with the other end simply dangling (i.e., not plugged into anything), I saw that it measures 3 feet (again, that's when it's not stretched); when not stretched at all, it measures just 3 feet. Of course, this would not result in 20 feet when it's stretched. Sure enough, when I plugged it into an amp, I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 6.5 feet. This might not bother you; it doesn't bother me since I didn't want the extra cable length. But if you need anything like a 20-foot cable, you're going to have to get something else. [2] Finally, a minor point: If you're using this on a guitar with a Strat-style jack, this cable will be a bit---but only a bit---more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar, no matter which end you plug into your guitar, because there's not much to grip when unplugging. Of course, if you pull on the cable itself, instead of one of the ends, you'll ruin it in no time. Overall, I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more, since I don't need more than the length it has, and since it makes no noise."
1202,823,4.0,i use this cable to run between my pedal board and amp at rehearsals in a small space.  i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p.a.  the box says they are 20' and maybe there is 20' of wire but the stretch on them is maybe 5-8'.
583,774,3.0,"works as described on the ipad. for the price id expect a more durable product.its all plastic, but no moving parts to concern yourself with so it should hold up fairly well."
1414,774,2.0,"Thank goodness Amazon doesn't sell this gadget for the forty-dollar retail price tag.I just got mine today and tried it out. The sound quality complaints are no joke. There is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the iRig or iPhone while playing will create a loud static noise. Don't know if a better quality jack on the iRig would've solved this problem or not.But if you're willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings, you may find a happy medium that you can live with.Still, the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool. If I find the need to really use one of these I'll probably spring for something that plugs into the iPhone dock connector. Until then this'll be a fun toy to play with.March 29, 2012 - Just a quick addendum to my initial review. I've since discovered the noise filter in the AmpliTube iPhone app, and wow, what a difference! It sounds much, much better now. No more hiss, no more static."
1193,774,0.0,"...what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss? My guitar I guess, but who cares? I honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.A question to AMAZON: Companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn't be prosecuted?P.S.I think it is ""too polluting"" for 'low cost' items to waste again in paper box, transportation, restocking work, refund work and so on. This is why 99% of the time I do not ask for my money back / BUT / sell this lemon on Amazon, online with other websites,  and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith (while testing nobody in iRig noticed the overwhelming  hisssssssing?) well that is beyond me!"
359,774,3.0,Works perfectly with iphone and ipad.  The app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed.  My only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it.  But it hasn't broke yet and it might never break.  Works perfectly with ear buds with mic/controller.  Great idea!
34,774,1.0,"No matter how many times I hard reset my 3Gs, no success. There is no problem with my jack, and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now. There is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work, but that's about it. I registered my Amplitude app, and followed all of the instructions on the box. I tested the iRig with an iPhone 4 and was able to get it operating.I am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend's iPhone 4. But for my purposes with a 3Gs, it is a brick. If anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation, I will re-rate the product."
607,774,4.0,"If you own an iphone/ipod touch and play guitar or bass you need this one.Was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this.The sound is incredible.Buy it, seriously."
514,774,2.0,"I was very disappointed when I tried this thing. I bought it so that I could play along the songs that I have on my Ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted (don't thing I haven't tried changing the settings on the effects/amps). Also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables. If you want to record what you play, you're probably better off saving some money and buying the Boss recorder or something like that. Being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it, it sounds so horrible is unbearable.Update: July 8, 2012. Against my better judgement I brought the Slash Amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better. I guess the tittle of this review stands, the free app sucks but if you pay for it it'll be actually useful. I added two stars to the product."
1335,774,4.0,"I bought this because I had a new baby at home and this allowed me to practice without rocking disturbing her. It's affordable, and does the same thing as more expensive adapters"
854,774,1.0,"This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad. But if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD. The HD sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. This guy, not so much. There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig, and it seemed to get worse over time. It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. If you look, you can usually find the HD somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. I upgraded and would absolutely do it again."
49,774,3.0,"I got the irig thinking i'd use it for performance, but he app leaves somthing to be desired.  I had a very hard time fining a tone I could live with, plus, once you add any of the virtual pedals, the feedback was rediculous."
742,350,3.0,"Sat on my Snark - Good tuner but takes some patience. No quick tuning, but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc. Would probably buy again, however will also get another Snark - much easier for quick stage / sight tuning"
859,350,3.0,"This is my first strobe tuner.  So far it has been wonderful for intonation/initial setups.  It may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure; it is accurate!  The only thing I don't like is that the housing feels ""cheap.""  Like plasticy cheap.  It was packaged in an attractive tin (which is not good for fitting in the guitar case) and I wouldn't take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the go-to tuner.It is easy to use, though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tuner.UPDATE:The battery life is short as noted by another reviewer. Since I only use it for initial setups and intonations I remove the battery when I place it back in its tin. There's a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful."
1204,350,4.0,"I really like this tuner.  it works very well.  once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner (ie., the moving black squares to no longer move),  then tuning is a simple and accurate thing.  it works great on all of my guitars, acoustic and electric.  comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it.  it cause a few bucks, but I think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons, that it is worth it."
327,350,2.0,"As my reviews demonstrate, I'm a sucker for a new tuner.  Peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners. I'd even tried one, once, but decided it wasn't the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams.  So, when I saw that Peterson had introduced a clip on tuner, I couldn't help but salivate.""Awkward"" is a relative term, but I don't feel it's a disservice to use it here.  The typical clip-on tuner has an LCD ""needle"". When the needle is dead center, the string is tuner.  If it's short of center, the string is flat.  If it's past center, the string is sharp.  The SC-1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate, analogous to what a strobe might look like.  A string is in tune when the rings stop rotating.  I found that with the way the sound of strings decays, it's difficult to get the rings to stop spinning, even in the SC-1's sustain mode.  (I've already returned the tuner.  Otherwise, I just realized, it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the SC-1 and with a Zoid or Intelli.)The SC-1 also boasts a ""sweetened"" mode for tuning guitars.  However, when  I tuned my lounging-at-home guitar this way, I found the needle was dead center on every string on my Intelli tuner. (For those who've read my other reviews, my preferred Zoid was in the case with my favorite guitar.)It may well be, and others may report, that the SC-1's feature set make it ideal for other situations.  However, if you main purpose is to keep a guitar in tune, then, with the SC-1 costing more than THREE ZoidsZoid Z-1000 Clip-On Tuner by Sabineor FOUR IntellisIntelli IMT500 Clip-on Chromatic Digital Tuner for Strings, I recommend that you consider the Zoid or Intelli."
858,350,4.0,"All that needs to be said is that  &#34; It's a Peterson &#34; Just the best Tuner's ever. I also use one on My Pedal Board, Wouldn't use anything else !!!!!!"
827,350,2.0,"Peterson makes some of the best and most accurate tuners and their high end strobe tuners are a must for the professional guitar repair shop allowing for accurate intonation and set ups. This tuner is accurate and I have even successfully set the intonation on a couple of my instruments using it (although it is not intended for this purpose). However I purchased it for the intention of taking it along to gigs in my guitar case. Unfortunately, due to the flimsy plastic construction I don't feel that it is up to the task and it would only be a matter of time before it gets broken if taken out of the house or on the road. Far better off purchasing a cheap Snark tuner that if lost or broken wouldn't be a big deal to replace and is accurate enough for most peoples use."
89,233,4.0,"USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability. The reason being is that they are condensers for one, and the other is that this mic has a built in interface. An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and (Analogue to digital, and digital to analogue) AD/DA converters. Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer; way, way better. So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential. So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and you.There are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments. (Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW.) Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks.The really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money. So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal, quick, easy, and affordable.One of the problems with using it in Pro Tools, or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time. Since the mic has a built in interface you can't use any other. Even in Garage Band for MAC, although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously. So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need. I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio. I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one. Some other MXL's like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end. When bottom fishing for a good/decent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellers.When using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary. If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter. It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold. There are also output adjustments as well.One other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC. So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I couldn't get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software (free 60 day trial) also downloadable from MXL. So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel, and then ""Sound"" and then type ""Troubleshooter"" into the search box in the upper right corner. The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero. I moved the slider up and bang it worked.So for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into; it's a mini jack like you have on your computer. So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod-casting, or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels. This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic."

1422,233,3.0,"I love my MXL 2010 microphone for its versatility, warmth in capturing the voice, and build quality. Most reviews I've read of MXL microphones have always emphasized it's clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments. The MXL Studio 24 aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface. It keeps recording equipment minimal, literally connecting just through the usb cable. In short, the MXL Studio 24 has an excellent build (stand & microphone), easy to use software, and clear recording capabilities.Features:1) 22mm Condenser Capsule (not very big, but will suit most people)2) Cardioid pattern (I recommend also looking at microphones with figure 8 and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better)3) Zero Latency monitoring (a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have)4) Frequency response 20 Hz - 20 kHz (My MXL 2010 has a 30Hz - 20kHz. The 30hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows)5) Output 1/8"" headphone jack, USB audio6) High pass filter 120Hz, 235Hz, 465Hz (software controlled)7) Lightweight 340gThoughts- Very impressive build. It's built like a rock & has a very fine finish. The grill and the frame around the grill are solid. I was surprised at how heavy the base was. It has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place. It's not some cheap plastic.- The recording capability is parallel to my experience with myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Mic. The clarity and power isn't nearly as good as the MXL 2010, but is certainly close. Using an USB interface, a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more. With USB, it's a bit more set for you, but that may suit some people perfectly. If you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software, this is a solid option.- Easy to use. Plug it in via USB and you literally on your way. The software installation is optional. The microphone works without it. Windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups.SummaryThe MXL Studio 24 USB microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build. There are certainly cheaper USB condenser microphones, but not many compare to the build and durability of MXL products like this one. To me, the fairly luxurious price of the MXL 24 is justified with it's excellent build, clear recording, and the ease of use. If you're not too sure about getting this USB condenser microphone or any USB microphone for that matter, I recommend getting a condenser microphone (non-USB) and plugging that in via USB interface. If you need any guidance at all with that process, I'm more than willing to help out. Cheers"
16,233,2.0,"This microphone only records in mono, and if you're unsure of what that means, it doesn't capture sound to it's full potential, and doesn't create a left/right feeling. All recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction, and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts, I wouldn't recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality. It looks nice, and it would b e great for a Skype call, but it really wasn't what I was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out. If you're looking for a mono microphone, this is however a very good mono microphone."
1425,233,2.0,"This is an intriguing idea for a microphone: a nice condenser with built-in monitoring.  A possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal.  It seemed to me that I should test it both as a microphone and as a USB IO device.  The very first appearance is impressive.  There's a nicely-compartmentalized carrying case.  Inside, there's a milled aluminum desk stand, a cable, a short manual and the microphone.  No shock mount. The mic looks good, but has almost no mass.  While this may not mean much, I own and have used lots of mics--none of them this lacking in heft.I set up a shootout in my studio. I have an acoustically-treated room with calibrated studio monitors, so I think I can do a fair test.  I kept it simple, using a steel string guitar played in several styles.  For a comparison mic, I used an AKG Perception 420.  This is a multipattern mic that's only a little more expensive; a cardiod-only version is exactly the same price as this MXL.  I used only the cardiod pattern, so I think it's a fair comparison on the basis of price.  To get to the point, the AKG beat the MXL in every way.  It was quieter, with a much better midrange.  A glance at the specs (online at MXL) shows a significant boost in higher frequencies, leading to about a 3dB rise at 8K or so.  The polar pattern is shown only in broadband (not at multiple frequencies) and it shows a dip at the 45-degree position.  These were things I could easily hear.So purely as a microphone, the MXL doesn't match up to other mics in its price range.  But that's not a complete comparison.  The MXL has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency.  That's a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses.  The mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable--better make sure you hold still when you use it.  There's also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level.  This means that it's easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you're mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level.There's also an optional software control panel (Mac and Windows) that goes with the mic.  It provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring.  I'm unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing; once done, it can't be undone.  I'd apply those after the fact when I've got plenty of time to dial them in.  This leaves the level controls--a place where MXL could have been more careful.  There's a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself.  It takes some doing to figure out which does what.  There's a highpass filter--tremendously useful when rumble is a problem.  But we don't know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain.  I hope it's analog, but there's nothing about it in the documentation.  Then there's the biggest problem.  There's a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic's headphone jack.  But this also means that--depending on your DAW--it's easy to set up a feedback path.  You won't like that.The biggest question in my mind is ""just who is this microphone for""?  A traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate.  I have mics (both expensive and inexpensive) that I've had for years and years.  Only the preamp/interface changes.  This MXL is USB-only, 44/48 only.  You can't easily set up multiples of USB mics without clocking issues.  Most USB/FIrewire mic preamps have a zero-latency monitoring mode, so the mic doesn't really offer anything you can't get elsewhere.  In the end, I don't really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians.  To me, that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer.  If you're a podcaster or a serious Skyper, then this mic deserves consideration.  It's a decent mic for spoken voice--the HF boost is helpful in bringing out articulation--and the single USB connection keeps your desk uncluttered.  Of course, there are plenty of other choices for that application.  But I think that's the best light to shine on this one."
475,688,4.0,"Too much noise with one spot. This was way better.Lot of feature.Outlets 1&#8211;3 can all be used to power either 9V or 12V pedals. For each outlet, just use the VOLTAGE SELECTOR switches to choose the voltage you need, plug in your pedal and go!Outlet 4 works the same way and gives you a similar choice &#8211; except that it&#8217;s between 9V and 18V.Outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time. If you use them both at the same time, you might get some noise. Like outlets 1&#8211;3, outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9V and 12V. Outlet 6 is a 12V AC outlet for pedals that require AC power.6 isolated outputs delivering 300mA each (centre pin is negative) AC output at connector 6. Will power all pedals.Most of my pedals are 20 to 30 mA. So potentially I could have 40 plus pedals in a chain.

Once you&#8217;ve selected your voltage options, just plug in and play!Excellent!Don't even think about it.Just get it.Highly recommend it"
256,688,4.0,"Its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly. And ive noticed it helps cut down on excessive noise generated by pedals with when cheaper power sources are in use. I wish the power cable for the supply was longer but its nothing an extension cable cant fix. Weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down. I lt didnt bother me really but if you get the same situation and you cant stand it, im sure you coukd just open it up and flip the little switch box around."
195,688,4.0,"I picked up an old Boss ME-6B that required the Boss BRA-120 power supply. That thing outputs 12vAC. It also has a different size connector. Being that those wallwart power supplies go for around  thirty dollars, I wasn't interested. So instead I spent ninety more dollars on this fuel tank and got a DC Power Plug 5.5x2.1mm to 6.3X3.0mm female adapter. Using  the 12vAC output on my Fuel Tank Chameleon works great. Awesome overkill solution. It also powers everything else and looks fine doing it."
769,688,4.0,"This power supply is unbelieveble versatile... when i first saw this i believed it was only for 6 pedals but it turns out it can power up A LOT pedals better than any power supply out there.... this power up my 12 pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more... im buying 3 more and it will work, only with this!! Thats why i say this is the best on the world!"

585,521,4.0,I believe I've rated this instrument before.  I really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it.  I also like the fact that it doesn't require a 9 Volt Battery whereas others I played did.  I would buy from this company again and probally will in the future.  Thank You.
160,521,3.0,"This is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better. Cheap case but does at least fit the guitar.

For the money ; )"
1062,521,4.0,"Right out of the box, playable!  I did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime.  The electronics are just fine on the guitar I got.

There were some minor flaws in the finish, but for the money spent, this is a real workhorse and plays great!"
906,649,3.0,"It is a nice strap.  It takes care of business just fine.  I wish I could have found a more colorful style, but all I could find on line was black.  But it's a very good strap."
918,649,4.0,"This strap is comfortable, has plenty of room to expand it to fit, and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you.  Perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele, and even the extra thin travel ukes.  I really like it!"
462,649,4.0,I have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps. This fits just right and looks just right.  It's well made and not too expensive.  I just wish I had found them before buying all those guitar straps.
1255,649,4.0,"I ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes.  It just works.I already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head. The problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously).  With a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place. Chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck.This is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow.  The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes. It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke. The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way. In my case I installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand. Here are the buttons I used:Strap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside. It can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it.

881,649,3.0,A well-designed strap that looks and works really nice. I'd say it's a little expensive. They should cut the price down by at least 1/3 and it would be a 5 star rating.
124,649,4.0,"I looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one.  I hesitated a bit because I couldn't find anywhere that they specified the width, but it was a good price, so I took a chance.  It's about one and a half inches wide, by the way.  I'm very happy with it and I like that it has the flexibility to attach one end to either the headstock or a button.  I can't think of any negatives, it's a nice, functional, non-flashy strap that does it's job well, and it's wide enough that it doesn't feel like it's digging into my shoulder."
1030,833,4.0,for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal.use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though. it just does the job and im more than satisfied.it works awesome with electric guitar too. just get it!
533,833,3.0,"Was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal, especially a delay, for this price. But I figured, how can you go wrong...if it's not good, at least you're not out a lot of money. I've been thoroughly impressed with this pedal. Much more sturdy than it appears in photos. I actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it. Works great so far and don't regret purchasing...worth every dime...where else can you get a great-functioning delay pedal for this price?"
1204,833,4.0,"this is very inexpensive and works great for my home-wanna be purposes.  it is not superloaded with heavy delay, etc. but it definitely gives you the effect.  it links well with other pedals.  the Battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a 9 v plug in.  therefore, I would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard 9V plug in on Amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead.I like it enough that I will probably get a few more of this company's petals as the effect is good and the price is right.for my limited purposes, this works great.  if you are a pro gigging or on the road, you probably want to get a more versitile, heavy duty and expensive delay petal."
1396,833,3.0,"This delay is really nice, especially for the price.  I am a fan of the FAB line of effects and have several of them.  My favorite is this delay and the Echo.  They have been very durable and I am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable.  My only complaint is the markings on the level knobs.  They have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see.  This could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface.  This can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush, but it should have been considered ahead of time."
823,833,1.0,Bought this for a friend. Cheap plastic enclosure. Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay. He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay. Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal.
911,833,4.0,Like most of the other Danelectro pedals this one has a great sound and in this case a fairly inexpensive price though it is higher than most of their other pedals.  Once again though get the AC-DC adapter for it as it'll put you in the poor house supplying 9v's to it...it eats them like candy
638,833,3.0,"The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works.  I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments, but it does the job it was made for.  The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged."
1018,833,4.0,"I love these cheap little pedals.I don't know if these would make a long tour with rough use - but they will be good for small club use with a careful handler.Great for around the house and rehearsal.A little noisy - but what do you expect at this price, right?So far very reliable after a few months of use. I will take this out on a little club tour and post back with problems and reliability concerns and if there are any preventative measures to address beforehand.Otherwise - great product. They look cool also - like something out of the 60's Star Trek or something.*************************************09/27/2013I still use this pedal on my main pedal board - it just sounds so good!Sound guy asked me about it the other night - and when I showed it to him he didn't believe me.$10 for some of the best analog delay sounds out there - who needs boutique pedals?"
1389,833,4.0,"I have two delay pedals, both inexpensive (this one and a Behringer) and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer, the Danelectro sounds more natural.  The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal, which is perfectly ok for some applications.  The Danelectro has a warmer, almost analog feel.  It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos.  The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet, you're not going to break it.  The only thing I don't like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it.  I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the ""retro"" look of this pedal.  Ok, fine.  I've heard pedals costing twice as much that don't sound as nice as this one.  As one reviewer once wrote, there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board; I, however, think some of these cheap pedals function quite well, and in some cases, just as well as their more expensive counterparts.  If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail, OCD, and other ""boutique"" pedals, I promise the other ones won't catch AIDS from this.  In fact, the whole ensemble will benefit."
446,833,3.0,"I've owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk. The delay is amazing, the repeats trail and decay beautifully,The controls give you a wide range of tones...But, They've both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me!  One constant high pitched screeching tone!My signal chain was low gain, And its done it when it was the only pedal In the chain, so It's not  another pedals Influence... I love the sound, but, I won't use it live in case of feedback...That being said its still a very good pedal."
150,439,4.0,I replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar.  While these strings are a bit harder to play (they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play) they do sound great. A lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar.
793,439,2.0,"Whenever I played with traditional strings, my fingertips would turn green. This was because bare metal would react with the salt and sweat from my fingers and oxidize (similar to the Statue of Liberty). This corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out. The defining feature of this product is the coating which is meant to prevent moisture from causing this reaction. Therefore, your strings last much longer. Traditionally, the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings. However, this product is wonderful! For the first 3 days the strings sound strange. But after they stretch out a little, they sound perfectly fine. My fingers have stopped turning green; proof that the product works! I have yet to buy another set of strings.2 months later:These strings have been great, but I do have to admit they do not last 3 to 5 times as long as advertised. They last about twice as long."
1263,439,3.0,"These do really well. I only wish I'd ordered the light's. I usually buy the Elizir, but I thought I'd give these a try. I'm sorry Martin, but I like the Elixer's the best. Just my opinion."
1224,364,4.0,"This amp is a ton of fun. The presets sound great by themselves, but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the Fender Fuse software. It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike."
984,364,4.0,"I LOVE THIS AMP. Here are the reasons: Solidly made, everything is high quality.  Best of all it comes with Fender Fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your PC using the USB cable (included) and &#34;control&#34; all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the amp(without even touching the knobs) INCLUDING special effects like various stomp box add-ins, effects like reverb, distortion, phaser, factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the PC screen visually. You can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created. If you want to play a Pink Floyd song you can download a David Gilmour preset and there you go. You got your Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall preset ready to go.  This is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me.  I can record directly from the amp into my PC Mixpad software program."
433,364,4.0,Takes you hours to play around with all the sounds. Built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage. Nice and loud in a small package.
1329,364,4.0,"I love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years. I still own a few, my favorite being the first Super Champ from the early '80s; Rivera nailed that one. I naturally prefer tubes for that true tone, but tried one of these out last year at a pal's place and was sold within two minutes. I bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then I can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp I've ever used.For the money it's a crazy deal. I have never once used the included online stuff or the Ableton software, so those add even more value to this package, no doubt. All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone, and this is that and plenty more. My all-time favorite tone is the clean glassy Fender late-'50s/early '60s sound, typified by the Bassmans and Twins and Deluxes of the pre-CBS era. That tone needs tubes to really sing, but to my amazement the amp modeling of this Mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes. You'll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there, especially on the Bassman settings. My Strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings, and my PRS absolutely smokes with real lease-breaking volume on Super-Sonic (dial the gain way back for a nice low-throttle roar).Having gain, volume and master lets you dial in a TON of tones with each amp model, and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus/tremolo etc plus various reverbs/delays etc, though I find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by; if I can't get the tone I want with my fingers then I need to learn how to is my motto. And this amp is so accurate that I can.Above all, this Mustang is MUSICAL. For a small amp that's a real feat, but for 100 clams it's a near miracle. Add a built in tuner (the most useful ""extra"" ANY amp can have), good effects, great amp models, the software and more online amp models (which I'll get around to one day but so far I get all the tone I need from the amp as it is), plus 20 watts for lots of headroom, and this is a straight up steal for a bill.The only thing missing is serious bass at volume, but this is an 8 after all, not a 10, so you'll always miss some of the real bottom. But what's there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume; only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides. You could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy.All told, the Mustang I is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now (Crate and Line 6 etc don't come close), but paired with a mini-Strat this would be the absolutely PERFECT beginner's set up for a kid looking to play anything from the Beatles to Metallica and everything in between.Can't recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can't come in a small solid state amp. It can, it does, and it's cheaper than I can still believe.Fender truly went to 11 on this one.Leo would be proud!"
128,364,3.0,"The Mustang 1 was a great buy for another great Fender product.  It has more bells and whistles than I can mention but it's sophistication is lost on me.  I was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the Mustang it seemed that's all I was getting.  Great little amp, just not for me."
46,364,4.0,"I bough this amp for my 9 year old son who is learning guitar for his Christmas present.  I thought that since I love Fender guitars and since he has a mini Squier we'd like to get something in the Fender Family.  I seriously expected a cheap imitation of a Line 6 Spider with a Fender logo slapped on it.  I should have had more faith in Fender.I am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp.  The AMP models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool I have ever used.  The amps don't sound digital or processed, they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain.  You would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it.  I can't get over the Bassman, the twin Reverb and the Deluxe.  They sound so full and strong.My biggest compliment of the Mustang is that it is the ONLY modeling amp that has great sounding Vintage tones.  Line 6 has tons of metal stuff, and a lot of weird niche tones.  Vox has never really made great modeling stuff.  Digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible.If you play Blues, Rock, Classic Rock, Country, Funk etc... This amp is for you.  There is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for Modern Metal, but Metalheads might be better off with the Line 6 stuff.The other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls.  By looking at the controls, you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound.  You don't need to dive 5 levels deep into an LCD screen in order to make great sounding tweaks.But if you like to go deep, you'll love the Fender Fuse software.  It is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound.The fact that Fender not only included FUSE with this amp, but also the Ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything, is just frosting on the cake.I am a father of 4 who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing, with the added features of a headphone jack and an AUX in, I can play whenever I want.  I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now, and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all.The value of this amp is amazing.  People will shell out 2-3x as much for a Line 6 modeler, but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the Fender tones."
626,364,4.0,"This amp is awesome! Its great JUST like it's advertised. I play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the Fender Fuse software. Fender Fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed & advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire. The amp itself has 24 presets (as advertised) & are shown in 3 different colors (Red, Green, & Orange)  and you can totally customize the presets. So if you want 24 different distortions go for it! Another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials & learn how to use it & record some music but you can't save them (bummer i know) BUT! it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings. One last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal (about $20)the Fender mustang 1&2 can only USE the 1 button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses 2 buttons or up can only be use by Fender Mustangs 3 & up REMEMBER THIS!"
754,364,4.0,"I have been playing for over three decades, and it has been a while since I have owned an electric guitar.  I bought this amp along with a Epi Les Paul 100.  All I can say is wow!  This is a great combination.This amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects.  Well built and looks even better in person than the picture.  Plenty of power as well.  Better than anything including the stage quality amps like Marshals from back in the day.  A great practice amp, but good enough you could use it for a small gig.  Going to pick up the optional foot switch.If you buy you won't be disappointed."
621,364,4.0,"For $99 you get the best good sized, heavy duty, high quality amp with tons of SOUND!-Construction: Solid, good material and parts, Fender used the good stuff.-Sound: Nice clear & LOUD sound especially for an 8"" speaker and 20W amp. You can definitely jam with a drummer no problem, or just shred it wearing headphones.-Effects: There are 9 ""amp models"" (i.e. ""57 deluxe"", ""metal 2000"", etc...) and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from, you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp models.The effects include chorus, deep chorus, flange, tremelo, vibration, phaser, step filter, delay (150ms, 300ms, 700ms), Reverb, large hall, small room, echo filter, octaver, etc...)So what are the presets? Each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds).When you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the ""gain"" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set. Same with treble, bass, volume, and all other effects. The moment you touch any dials or effects knobs, you have custom control to tweak each preset, just temporarily, or save it if you wish.It's so great, because often I feel I would have made a present slightly more this or that, simply grab the gain or change the treble, or move from delay to reverb and make it your own! Very easy.-Ease of use: Plug in your guitar, spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects. Plug in ipod or computer with 3.5mm male cable. It's that easy!-PC Software: I've heard their is trouble installing, mine said ""error"" and did not install on Windows 7. I know there are ways to fix this, and I will do so when I have some time. Comes with a USB cable (mini for the amp, regular plug for the computer). Works for mac or PC, get more presets, use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer. Play on guitar rig and amplitude. Awesome.-Size: Perfect. Big enough to give it a serious look, and a quality feel. Small enough to fit easily under a table, next to your desk, etc. Looks like 18""x18"" to me. The front metal-looking grill is mesh, but quality and looks great.-Tuner: Super simple. Doesn't tell you which note is in tune, just tells you left, right, or green in center for ""in tune"".All in all when compared to the Line 6 Spider, and many other fender amps, this one has the quality sound, the dozens of different effect combinations, input for a footswitch, aux for ipod, and USB for computer. It has it all. I jam through headphones for hours each day since I bought it. The reverb and gain distortion are so clean, and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone. My guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp.Don't sleep on this, it's $99 for a loud quality amp with $1,000s worth of effects peddles built in.And did I mention, EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE so easy I could teach a 5 year old. Select a preset, change the dials you want to change, make changes permanent only by hitting ""save"" otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them.LOVE THIS AMP, and I've shopped EVERY comparable model. This is the one, hands down worth a minimum of $150.Louder than my friends 60W!:D ONE LOVE FENDER MUSTANG YOU ROCK!"
1096,364,4.0,It's been a while since last we got together. The old amps we had were way too big. For me this one is just right.Fender Mustang I Electric Guitar Amplifier
52,364,4.0,"Well over the past 4 years I've been running through a bunch of these mini, micro, battery powered, small tubed, and solid state, model budget amplifiers.Lets see, done all the Blackheart small amps, the Vox mini-3 & AC4TV, Roland MICRO-CUBE, plus a few other small amps. I just sold my Fender Super Champ XD and wasn't going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors, I just cannot jam the way I'd like to...I really liked all the above named amps but they really didn't give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors. Loved the Fender Super Champ probably the best, but there wasn't a headphone jack. Same with the Blackhearts and the Vox AC4TV and the potential of these amps just couldn't be used by me. So I settled on the Vox Mini-3 (4watt), because it has a headphone jack, is also A/C or battery powered, among a lot of other great features and sounds.. but I did have to give up tube amp option...So as I said I sold my Super Champ like a week ago and as I was mailing it out using the Amazon online mailing appz when I saw a picture and price (in the browser) on this new Fender Mustang I and I figured... what the hell. Lets see what its got to offer for under $100. I mean everyone was giving it a 5-star rating, so whats a $100 bucks, even though I've never had a good sounding solid state amp.Well I must say this thing rocks! There are like 3 phases of model amps, most I didn't like at first but was able to fine tune most of em to sound pretty great. I mean its only a $100 amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals, but it does stand up pretty nice. Plus it has the headphone jack (and a couple other plugins and effects) and this thing will blow your ears out. Most amplifier headphone jacks.. tap out and never got loud enough for me, but this thing screams and blow-out your ears. I've had it now like 3 days and was thinking about sending it back, but for $100, there's nothing in the market that can compare or compete with its, SOUND, low pricing, and options... So I'm now glad that I sold my Fender Super Champ XD and bought this one and put the other $150 back in my pocket... ya!This is the best solid state amp I've ever owned and I still miss the tube option.. But I'm sure something better will appear next year and until, then... well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this Fender AMP!"
307,364,4.0,"This little amp is amazing.  It's loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps, AND you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp.  I love it!  If you need a practice amp (and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private) then this is the amp you  should buy.  The price is right, and the size is right.  Enough said.  Buy it!"
629,364,4.0,"It looks nicer than pictured, seems solid and well-constructed, but most important of all it sounds fantastic! I've only had this amp now for roughly a day, but stayed up a good part of last night playing. I couldn't stop. This morning I opened the outside doors and cranked it all the way up to about half volume. (Scared the cat and made the dog wonder what the heck that new thing is making all the noise.) Beyond the halfway setting, it would've hurt my ears. Yes, it's that loud! Absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and small-event purposes. So far, I've only played through the amber pre-sets and only experimented some with the modulations knob. I like the bluesy, tube-effect modelings the most and don't know that I'll see much need to go looking to create a lot of custom settings. But it's nice to know this amp can deliver, either with or without the additional FUSE software, such an incredibly diverse array of sounds should the need ever arise. Thanks, Fender!"
763,364,4.0,"I got this on sale from GC for $80 shipped (plus $7 tax arrrgh). First and foremost this amp is AMAZING.  All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true.  My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs (lol) and this amp does it all.  The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just can't be described, they have to be heard.  The modulations, and del/reverbs are well done also.  There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software (or taken out completely).  All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust, and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good (even with my substandard playing ability!  Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp.  The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use.  Headphones work well also.  About my only real complaints are so minor- no place to store the Power cord or USB cord (included!).  Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through.  The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour.  The headphone jack is a 3.5mm and most good headphones are still using the 1/4"".  Not a big deal but the 3.5mm to 1/4"" adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy.  The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down.  No corner protectors on this.  All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $1000's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams!"
792,364,4.0,When I bought this it wasn't the amp I wanted but because of budget and reviews I picked it.  I couldn't be happier.  This little amp really impressed me.  Add Fender Fuse software and its probably the best $99 I've spent in a while
978,364,4.0,"I got one of these here on Amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp, an older Fender 25 watt blackface two-channel that didn't have integrated EFX (that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my church).Great little amp. Only had it for a couple days, but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing. Clean tones are pristine. Distortion tones, a bit on the transistory side, but again, I haven't played with the setting enough (or even tried all the emulations). Controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on. It is a bit lacking in low-end, to be expected from a small 8"" speaker. But that is okay for practice and rehearsal. It is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer (depending on the style of music). I did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any TWO settings you define.Have not had a chance to mess with the included software, but intend to do that when I have time. I like the fact that I can tweak the amp to my EXACT preferences and it stays in memory; I only really have to do it once. Great feature.Only suggestions to Fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord (standard computer type) and optionally, the included USB cable.Overall, for the price, it is an incredible value. Great alternative to lugging my full rig (Marshall 2X12 cab, racked Rocktron Pirhanna, ADA 100 watt tube head, Alesis Midiverb IV and some other stuff). Get yours while you can at this price.UPDATE -- The Fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing. I now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via USB and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones. The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET. I am going to buy a second one, probably the larger Mustang III, cause I want the larger Celestion speaker. You know, pretty much every Fender product I have ever purchased has been first rate, and this amp is no exception. And I don't care if it is made in Mexico (my guitar is a differnt matter though...)"
262,571,4.0,im not a profesional player but i like to play once in a while just for fun and this sound great.
461,571,0.0,"My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like ""what music snobs"" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying ""throw away your pedals, you won't need them"" and ""I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now"", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it."
46,571,4.0,"As far as amps that model vintage tones.  This is the best.For my ear, Line 6, Vox, Crate, Digitech etc are nowhere near the Fender Mustang if you are comparing Vintage tones.I have played amps and effects from many companies, as well as many of the 'hybrid amps' that combine tube and digital tones, and if you are looking for the best recreation of Vintage Blues, Rock, Hard Rock, Country tones... the type of tones that you get from some of the famed Fender amps, the Mustang Series is as good as you are going to do.I originally bought the Mustang I for my 9 year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him, I could hardly let him play.The tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp.  It is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs.  When you add the Fender FUSE to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value. (not to even mention the Ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp.)The reason I love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great Fender amps like the Bassman, Deluxe Reverb, and Twin Reverb.  I have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well.I have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy.For the Tube amp snobs...Nothing is going to match the sound of a really great Fender Tube amp.  But if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the Mustang will be a great practice amp for you. OR... if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your Fender Tube amps weighs, the mustang is a great choice.  I am selling my only tube amp now that I have the Mustang II because I don't gig and really need an amp that I can practice with at night while the kids are in bed.For the Non-Computer folk...There is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer.  And if you want to give it a try, it couldn't be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones.For the Metalheads...This amp probably is not for you.  Go try and buy a higher gain Line 6 or the Vox ADT series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones.  There are some decent metal tones to download on the FUSE, but the real strength of this amp is Vintage tones.Let me make it clear!  I played my son's Squier Mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing.  I have a Fender Strat, Squier Tele and a Les Paul and they all sound amazing in this amp.This is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely NO buyers remorse.  Unbeatable value.  A great toy.  A perfect practice tool.  You can't beat it."
775,571,4.0,"Well, just got it, plugged in and here are some initial impressions.1. Pretty much what I expected - much more ""relaxed"" at higher volumes than the M1.2. Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks.- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1- will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor.- although it has less overall sparkle, that also translates to smoother highs. I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy. This is of course via the front panel only. I'm sure it can be done using the Fuse editor.3. It's supposed to be 7 lbs. heavier than the M1 but it sure doesn't feel like it. I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if there's a way to shoehorn a 12"" speaker in there.4. For the most part, the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update, needing just a few adjustments here and there.5. I'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I won't have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1. That of course translates to more headroom for the power amp.More from editing via Fuse - here are a few of the things that I found and liked.- The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxe's Cab and vice versa. The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57's cab while the 57 model's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65's less sparkly cab. The 57 also seems to have more low end girth.- The Twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassman's cab.- The SuperSonic's Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain. It's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy. It's a very fat sounding Cab sim.- Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my Tex-Mex pickups. I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet (my other guitar has mini humbuckers) but somehow I get the feeling that I won't like it as much as I do with the strat. I think this is understandable though. Since Fender has always been all about the single coils, I'm not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on.So far, for 200 bucks... I couldn't ask for more."
1200,571,4.0,"I passed on all the Fender G-Dec units for years,(still glad I did), instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV. They are both great amps for sure, but for the money, Fender has really got this one right.  The clean tones on this are just great. The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy.  The amp is just about perfect for bedroom, studio or practice. I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studios...I still love my Line 6 units, especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks, and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV.  But if you are in the market for a great practice amp, or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo, Fender hits the mark on this one. It's just ridiculous what is in this for $199.I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp, not even a contest. Against a Spyder IV, individual tastes will vary.Only complaint is the ""stacking"" of the six effects onto just two knobs. But that is a minor complaint. Most people don't use chorus and flange at the same time anyway.If you are in the market for a cheap, reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal, you owe yourself to look at this thing. Right now, it is the biggest bang for the buck. I only wish I had bought the Mustang III, but it was not available yet when I purchased."
1323,105,4.0,"Was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my 1 year slept. Before I was plugging in headphones to my amp head, but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up (take out electric plug covers, get all cords out of the cabinets, etc). Oh how life changes with a baby! :)This little product is the perfect solution.It takes two AAA batteries (some generic brand are included in the package). There are two ON settings: regular ON and ""FX"" ON. Regular on is basically like a standard lead channel. Turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean. Crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch. Nothing heavy metal, but a nice crisp crunch. FX ON turns on a little delay effect. You can not adjust the delay effect, only turn it on or off. There are also knobs for volume and tone.Plug your headphones into the side, and you can also plug in an MP3 player on the top to jam with a backing track.VOX has samples for all of their AMPlugs on their website, however they seem to be missing samples for the Joe Satriani version. I would say that the JS version is pretty close to the ""LEAD"" amplug.I have a pair of middle/lower range headphones (Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Headphones) and the amplug sounds fantastic.In the title I wrote ""wait for this to go on sale"" ... b/c of the JS branding, this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs. However, it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled! Personally at the higher MSRP i dont think its worth it, but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone."
1116,105,4.0,"This is my 3rd VOX Amplug I have purchased through Amazon.  They are all awesome in thier own way.  The Satriani Amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb.  Without the effects on it is similar to the Lead plug with much lighter distortion - still has nice crunch to it though.  If you are a Satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining!  If you could only buy just one, this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play.  I love metal, rock, classic rock etc.The first song I played through this plug was 'The Star Spangled Banner' (ala Jimmi Hendrix) and wow, the Satch effects just make it sound amazing!  The Top Gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well.If you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the Metal Amplug - it rocks your face off(I LOVE MINE). The AC30 Amplug is real nice for classic rock and country (it is nice and clean but can go into AC/DC tones) - very versatile Amplug.The Satch Amplug is a welcome addition to my collection...I would tell you to buy it, and if I lost mine I would replace it immediately.  Same with the Metal Amplug.  If I lost my AC30 Amplug I would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another -  as versatile as it is, I don't play enough classic rock or country as I do metal."
1045,105,2.0,"I wanted this for overall practice however the only &#34;clear and good&#34; sound will be the satriani effect.if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure! it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted, it can't.still use it for practice and wont change it. its just hard to get a clean sound out of it."
1157,105,4.0,"For those unfamiliar with Vox's amPlug products, these things are amazing.  I'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990's, and they were mostly terrible.  What Vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers (which weigh virtually nothing, run for 10-15 hours on 2 AAA batteries, and plug directly into the guitar) is nothing short of amazing.  They have incredible amp-like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want.  Even through a pair of $20 Sony headphones, they sound amazing.  The star of the collection, in my opinion, is the Vox AC30 amPlug, which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to Top Boost overdrive.  If you haven't played an amPlug before, the AC30 one is $39.99 of the best money you'll ever spend.Now, getting to this specific Joe Satriani amPlug, it's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself.  Fans of Joe Satriani (even casual ones) will recognize elements of this sound right away.  Satriani has a very distinctive sound, which he crafted over the years using a modified Boss DS-1 Distortion and (more recently) his Vox ""Satchurator"" Distortion Box.  It's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain, and colored with a delay effect.  Both of those elements are present on this signature amPlug.  You have a level control, a gain control, and a tone control.  There's also three switch positions: Off, On, and Fx.  The ""Fx"" position engages the delay effect, but the tone is otherwise the same.PROS:First, the price retails at $49.99, whereas most of the other models are $39.99.  (I believe the Lead amPlug is also $49.99 and also has a delay feature).  I think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money, but this is admittedly a sort of ""niche"" product.  Overall, however, you have several amPlugs to choose from, and if you choose this one, $49.99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone.  The tone has a real sweet spot between ""3"" and ""5"" that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes.  While it isn't necessarily and ""ideal"" rhythm guitar distortion, you can hit rich chords with nice sustain.  I prefer the tone on the higher gain levels, and you can really crank it up if you want to, but it sounds great at lower volumes too.  The delay is also surprisingly good - it's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap, which is pretty standard.  Adds a cool echo ""fullness"" to your solo progressions, much like a classic Satriani solo.  Again, the overall tone is fantastic.  With the amount of gain provided, you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit (though I've always thought of Satch of more a technical, melodic guitarist than a ""metal"" guitarist).CONS:There are a few things to know about the Satriani signature model, but I don't think any of them should discourage you from checking it out.  While the delay is surprisingly good, you can't customize it.  You can't make the repeats shorter or longer, and you can't adjust the timing of the repeats.  Keep in mind that this is mostly a ""practice"" device for your personal use, however, and I still enjoy using the delay.  As for the tone, which I mostly discussed as a ""pro"" in the paragraph above, you should be aware that this is not meant to be a ""clean"" signal.  It is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar, but it's mostly distortion or bust.  The durability of all of the amPlugs has also been questioned by some.  The device is VERY lightweight and all plastic, except for the metal plug portion.  I don't doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily.  The switches and dials may also fail over time.  But frankly, at $40 or $50, it's probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging $100 for it, which would lock more people out of the market.  I would certainly buy another one (or several) if any of mine broke.  Finally, there as an audible ""hiss"" noise through your headphones anytime the device is on.  Slightly annoying when you're not playing, but I don't notice it at all once I start playing notes.THE VERDICT:One other ""dirty little secret"" to point out about these things: in addition to the Aux jack, which allows you to plug in an MP3 player and jam along, it is possible to use a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp, PA, or anything with speakers.  You might be surprised how good it sounds.As an after-note, I wrote most of this review playing on my Jackson DR6, which has two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers, and it sounded great.  I later tried it on a Gibson Les Paul (which is usually my primary guitar), and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers, it did not sound as good.  The distortion was much more ""fizzy"".  Haven't tried it with single coil pickups, but I think that it would likely work well with a Strat-type guitar due to the overall ""roundness"" of the tone.The amPlug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing, irrespective of their budget or living situation.  The Satriani model brings its own special character to the series, and if you like the tone as much as I do, might become an instant favorite."
323,105,4.0,Took it on vacation so I didn't have to leave my axe at home. Fit right in the guitar case with my headphones - got my practice and jamming in everyday with some good tone and effects. Worth the price and no lugging around a small amp just for practice on the go.
166,773,4.0,This may be 10Watts but it can fill a big room with its sound. Not too heavy and very handy for traveling. This can't be used for concert or gigs but for use in private/family use or maybe inside a church. Built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient.
523,773,4.0,"This little dude weighs next to almost nothing. It gets loud enough as you need it in a bedroom (LOUD), don't expect to gig with it, and don't expect Marshall Tube quality, either. It does however, sound amazing!! It's clean, bright and loud. For metal it's got great control of the distortion tone, which sounds pretty good."
552,773,4.0,"A good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control! It came extremely well packed. For the price, this is one great little dynamo!"
825,773,4.0,Good basic first amp.  Great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house!  Compact size makes storage easy.
885,773,4.0,"Rogue G10 10W Guitar Combo Amp Black is good small amp for practicing.Actually, it's loud enoucht for home.Recommend it."
356,773,3.0,"I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it's a nice little portable amp.Of course you can't drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much, but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive."
836,773,4.0,My son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it.  The Amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it.  Great purchase.
548,773,4.0,A nice little amp to rock out with... So it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all I asked.
469,5,3.0,a very recent purchase....I have not used it yet so I can't say much...however I have loaded the software on my laptop...the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling.....very good deal for newbies like me!!!
1289,5,3.0,"First, keys are not my best instrument to play, just a beginner, I'm a professional guitarist. That said, I purchased this for my home recording studio. The controller that I had was a ION but had mini keys. I love the fact that this controller has full size keys. Works great with my Mac Book Pro and Logic Pro X. I know it's not the best controller but it's good if your on a limited budget."
947,5,1.0,"Could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box.  Plugged it into the Macbook Pro, fired up GarageBand and right away it's MIDI connectivity was intermittent. Then it had some stuck notes.  Then it stopped being recognized at all.  It still got power from the USB bus, but no MIDI, no sound.  The jack was visibly wiggly, too.So, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back.  Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, I returned it and bought an M-Audio Oxygen 25 for $20 more."
120,356,0.0,Works as advertised but the keys are stiff. Pads take too much presure to activate. Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless. Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one. I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product.
491,356,2.0,First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless. You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response. The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable. There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs. HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last. For this price it is a 'Do Not Recommend' for me.
1165,356,2.0,"The size of this makes it awesome for carrying around and it all works great. I have it custom mapped for multiple softwares. I love the product and all the features for the price. My only problem is, is that the USB plug on the controller becomes lose very quickly after moderate use. This is actually a huge problem, once the plug stops working your out of a controller. I would recommend this controller for home use and to leave the plug in the controller and do touch unless you have to. When unplugging it just be careful and it'll last a lot longer. The price on amazon is awesome."
540,356,4.0,"This is a really amazing portable Midi Keyboard. This is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling. I've had no problems with it and the beat pads are really firm, but nice. You have to use a lot of pressure on the pads, but oh well. It is perfect. PLUS There are soo many settings and options to play with, as well as setting the knobs on the keyboard to do whatever you need it to do. Works amazing in FL Studio."
1033,675,4.0,small and unobtrusive; just leave it there everytime you play. get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you.
862,675,4.0,"This tuner looks nice, and works great. It puts guitars into the best tune. It has lasted for over a year and the battery hasn't died yet. Some might say it breaks easily but as long as it is dealt with gently there will be no problems. Great price, great tuner, worth the buy."
339,675,4.0,This tuner is great and well worth the $15 you will pay for it at most places but I've seen it as high as $30-35 and that is just a rip off.
342,675,4.0,I still love these things. I remember spending over $60 for a guitar tuner in the 80's and having to unplug from the amp to plug into the tuner to tune and then back to the amp with my guitar hanging round my neck. Now??? I just clip it and forget it till I need it and push it's little button. If I forget to turn it off it has an auto off feature if it detects no vibration for a while. A new batterry lasted me almost two years. My first tuner's battery it came with lasted over a year. Expect to pay $5 TO $6 for a replacement battery. My more recent Snarks are still running on original batteries.
793,675,3.0,"All I wanted was a simple tuner... that's what this is. If you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect. Pros: Works fast/accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale. Cons: Built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped. Also, tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room. FYI: Snark makes more complex tuners(Which are actually cheaper on amazon) that also have 3 or 4 extra features."
1327,675,3.0,"For this price, you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things, better yet, get one for each guitar you own.They're reliable and easy to use. And ACCURATE!!!You can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock. That way, they're easy to read and don't screw up the look of your guitar.Why no 5 star review? Because they're battery eaters. The provided battery lasts for about a month, then starts dimming. Not cool. A rechargeable version would be good."
1059,675,2.0,"My main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate.  It also occasionally fails to register at all.  I've tried putting in slightly different positions on the head of my guitars, but the contact is sporadic.  I A/B ed the Snark against two other tuners, and the snark fails to show notes that are a little flat and sometimes shows false sharp readings.  The other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear.  Most people like this tuner, and on the plus side I also liked its convenience and the ease with which the results can be read.  Unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch."
1079,675,4.0,Easy to use.  I can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background.  This is definitely more accurate than a person's ear while other instruments are playing.
1097,242,3.0,"Other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50-150 and more.  I just wanted a decent simple pedal that could be used on occasion with my garage band buddies.  This is perfect.  I've only used a few times so I can't testify to the durabilty, but it sounds great.  Does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal."
879,242,4.0,"I wanted a delay pedal but I'm not playing for big money so I had to watch the $$$ I spent. I read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the Rogue. I haven't had much time to REALLY play with it, but trying it out has been fun and I expect it will do the job for me!"
260,242,4.0,"I have countless delay pedals and racks. This inexpensive delay is very special. It has the tone and mojo of an analog delay. It won't give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for. It sounds great clean or dirty. it's a relatively short delay, which is great for many genres. Long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal Eric Johnson like music. I would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment. It's bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard, to your music. Pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you'll be near the dark side of the moon. Many musicians use two delay pedals. I know, I often do. This one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage. Both work together to help me find the tones that I am searching for. The unit itself seems sturdy and well made. I use carbon zinc batteries in mine. They just seem to sound better to my ears. Keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time.True bypass and no hiss. Great surprise as I never took Rogue seriously. Never thought it'd be my goto pedal."
551,242,4.0,"you can never have too many delays, so i pulled the trigger.  i was shocked at how good it sounds, not just &#34;for the money&#34; but over all.  it's won a spot on my pedalboard, and i'm picky."
129,606,4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when I was thinking about buying it, but I read all the review on it and decided to give a shot.  I figured for the price ($39.99 in late Nov 2012) that it wouldn't be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because I bought it to play around with while I visit my family in CA.  When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised!The guitar came in great shape.  It was packed well and didn't have any damage on it.  The top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it, but it doesn't affect the performance of the guitar.  It came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once I lowered the action on the guitar, it was much easier to play.The sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  It sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much.  The pick guard looks a bit cheap, but that's just nitpicking.If you want a cheap guitar that sounds great, I totally recommend this one.  I am extremely happy with this purchase."
344,606,3.0,"Sounds pretty good. Great for the price. New to guitars, but in 24hrs. it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings."
1206,606,4.0,"I have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100. I have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and I also have some cheapies. Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the ""Cheapies"" I've been dealing with Musician's friend forever. Rogue is Musician's Friend's brand. Music 123 is a Musician's Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars. I have several different models of Rogue guitars and I'm impressed with all of them. The Rogue RA-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster. Here's the good part, the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender! Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one. Once they realize it's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers,they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten. If you're not sure if you're serious about learning to play, this is the guitar for you. Even if you're an intermediate to advanced player, you still can't go wrong with this guitar. It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument. The finish and workmanship is also like what you'd find on a more expensive guitar. They look, play and sound great! Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price. They figure a guitar that cheap can't be much good. That's where they're wrong! You have to actually play one to understand what I'm talking about. Once you play a Rogue guitar, you too, will become a believer. This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire. If it happens to get damaged or stolen you're not out an arm and a leg. I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites, but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar, the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality. The Rogue RA-090 comes in a variety of color choices. If or when you decide to sell it, you can usually get back what you paid for it.I give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one. I've been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what I'm talking about. I do not own stock in Musician's Friend, Music 123, or Rogue guitars and I don't get paid to endorse them. This review is my honest opinion."
627,606,4.0,Good string action out of the box. Nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone.
927,34,4.0,"I've only recently heard of Joyo pedals, and that's because Amazon.com kept recommending them to me.  I normally stick with BOSS pedals - they sound good, and they're all the same size, so they're easy to set up/maintain.  This pedal was priced very well ($32), and had nearly a 5 star rating.  I used to have a BOSS Phaser (I don't recall which number off the top of my head.)  It was a pretty complex little pedal, and sounded great, but I needed money and sold it.  When I saw this pop up in my Amazon, I got curious, did some research, and decided it would be a wise investment.  Sure enough, it was!  It's obviously simple to use, having one knob and all.  Over all, the pedal sounds great, and seems to be very well made.  Based on this experience, I'm very much interested in checking out their chorus, flanger and overdrive pedals.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive, simple yet well-made and great sounding phaser!"
176,34,3.0,"I just got this pedal so I don't know how it will hold up over a  long period of time. But on first play it pleasantly surprized me. It does give you some of the way out sounds other pedals my give, but it does provide a gradual increase in phase as you turn the one knob. Mine came with a 9 volt in it but you can also use a adapter. Useful tones at dollar store price= good deal"
1162,34,4.0,"I bought this as i had already purchased tow other Joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was about.This phaser is perfect.  I do not use a dramatic effect, more or an EVH setting for leads.  This pedal is 99.8% sounding like the MXR.  I never give anything a 100%.  This is a a great phase pedal, great tone and a great price.  I am done thinking a good pedal must cost $200 and above.  This was like $35 and sounds awesome!"
324,34,3.0,"This is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers. I've used it for 8 months with no issues at all. It sounds great, it works perfectly and it was $40. As for quality control, I have several Joyo pedals, and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome. I've never used a Phase 90, so the ""clone"" factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser. It works, it's simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear. I've been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals. If you don't like it, get a refund. It's not rocket surgery."
767,786,0.0,"A dull, inept version of a TubeScreamer. Just sounds flat and boring. Not very inspiring. At all. (Then again, I never did really like TS's)......."
820,786,4.0,"Been playing for 30 years and I have used tube screamers extensively. As some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about.  It is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components.  Most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over 30 dollars. Are there better tube screamer clones out there? Probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit.  Build sturdy, I would gig with this without hesitation.I hate to leave this review because I know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products. Great pedal. Great value."
536,786,4.0,"This is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money.  Mine has the older paintjob with the monkey on it, which makes it sound infinitely better IMHO lol.  This is intended to be used with a tube amp to achieve breakup and it does that job very nicely. Those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere.  You can't blame a chicken for not quacking properly.  It plays nicely with other pedals and can be used to boost another dirtbox for when you've reached the part of Freebird that we've all been waiting for. The build quality is decent for the price and it claims true bypass thought I haven't looked under the hood.  Regardless of whether it's 'TRUE' or 'buffered', it doesn't color my sound when it's off.  Truth be told, I kind of prefer my Behringer TO800 tonewise- more of a personal preferance in the way I prefer Pepsi to Coke but still drink both - but the TO800 pedal isn't true bypass and the build is much more flimsy on that one. I think that if you are addicted to OD/FUZZ boxes like I am you should grab one of these for your toolbox.  If you aren't a hoarder of dirtboxes but you are just looking for a very nice tubescreamer on the cheap you can't go wrong with this one.  You can handpaint the cover with an owl or whatnot and tell your cork-sniffer bandmates that you spent an arm and a leg on it.  They will be none the wiser.  I think enough of this pedal/company that I just ordered the JF-02 OCD clone and will probably grab the Octive Fuzz when my wife isn't looking - though if one more pedal comes into the house this month I may be strangled in my sleep !"
888,786,4.0,30 bucks is better than 179 for the tube screamer from Ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube.  I use this on the clean channel of my Bugera V22 tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should.  Awesome with my LTD VC-401 with 59 and JB pickups.
1392,786,4.0,"Yep, I said it, BETTER than a Tubescreamer.This pedal has a wider gain range, far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid 80s 'screamer.The only thing it seems to lack is the &#34;smooth creaminess&#34; of an old 808, but I can easily live with that..This is an amazing TS clone, and for the price, cant be beat."
1060,786,1.0,"I honestly was not impressed. It looked Cheap, sounded cheap, what else is there to say, you get what you pay for!!! Another Chinese copy of a tubescreamer,"
204,786,3.0,"I don't know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all-mighty vintage tube screamers of Ibanez, but it is an exact clone including the same component values, potentiometers, ICs (JRC), etc.For proof that it is exactly the same, I was able to modify it for different frequency response (corner frequency), and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in TS9 mods. Of course the board is layed out a little differently.The only reason I gave it 4 (really 4.5) stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise (hiss) at higher gains, but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter (this gives it the characteristic mid-range boost). It can be cut with the tone control, but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier, and or a one-spot power adapter."
385,786,4.0,"I agree with the others here, this joyo is just a plain and simple OD just like so many others but at a fraction of the price. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. This thing stands up nicely on all three. Using it with Am Sp Tele, Hiway 1 Strat, Squier 51, Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ, Peavey Classic 30/50. Sounds amazing in any combo. Giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth."
367,786,4.0,"outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with (hossen). the pedal is everything i expected from it ..and a little more. Good crunch, nice light distortion when you want it, and it is not at all midrange sounding like a tube screamer. A definite improvement on a classic stompbox. Nice work Joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist."
889,786,3.0,"In my opinion, this thing is well worth the price. Gives great overdriven tube amp sound / versatile for 95% of music - not for bone-crushing metal. The knobs work fine but do not seem to roll-off or not very sensitive / precise. . . full range achieved from 6 to noon."
718,786,4.0,I swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts-9 tube screamer. You wont regret this purchase
245,786,4.0,"Awesome pedal, I love the joyo pedals, they don't break the bank and sound awesome. Glad I bought this pedal"
361,786,4.0,"I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal, but I didn't have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer. So, I took a chance on this little stomp-box from China.  It compares itself to the TS, right on the box, and for good reason.  They use the same chip. More importantly, the construction is solid, good looking, and takes up minimal pedal-board space.  The on-off switch seems a little chintzy, but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome. I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with, and plugging in to a power supply (not provided with unit).  It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine. It's responds well to your technique, and you can make it so funky, you can smell it!  It truly does have true bypass, and logical controls.  I don't have A TS to make direct comparisons, but for the money, this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want.  And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks.  Ba-Da Bing!"
1157,786,4.0,"There is no shortage of ""Tubescreamer clones"" on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues, jazz, and rock.  The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example.  But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best, and it's half the price of a TS-9.About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor (very similar to an MXR in size and switch) but ""cloning"" the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals.  Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products, but don't just take it from me - do your homework.  The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive, and there are great vendors/distributors within the U.S. that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days.  I'm definitely a fan of Joyo products.As for the ""Vintage Distortion"" itself, people have said it's based on either a TS-9 or the (more expensive) TS-808.  Frankly, while the latter is apparently warmer (and less mid-range heavy) than the former, I'm not sure there's any significant difference.  I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9, and it's probably one of the more exact ""clones"" in the Joyo lineup.  For example, the Joyo ""Ultimate Drive"" is an excellent (higher-gain) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD, but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there (some of which are arguably BETTER than the original).  With the settings matched, the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level, gain, and tone.  There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full, which isn't a bad thing.  It's very responsive to your playing style and, again, it sounds like a Tubescreamer.I'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer, if only because it's an iconic pedal that performs well.  But it's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place, I'd be no worse for the wear.  5 stars, highly recommended!"
1237,452,3.0,"I ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price.  This unit is of high quality, though."
959,452,4.0,"One of the the best lights I own. Small but fills a gym with light for under $100, what more could you ask? As the other reviewers boast, this is a great unit and I hope it lasts a long, long time."
661,452,4.0,"Great laser, nice big fat stars, red and green, worth the money.  Point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me.  Great effect."
507,452,3.0,"Despite being so small, it will fill most rooms Completely! These are lasers! You can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver. The patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace. I haven't tested the sound-feature but I've seen it on videos. I recommend this to anyone want to be entertained!"
289,452,4.0,"This is the American DJ Micro Galaxian red & green laser. It is the smaller version of the Galaxian laser with the same laser power output, but a smaller beam spread. It is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool. The small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord. It comes with a remote that works great, but has an antenna to pull up if needed, which seems like old technology. The remote has 4 buttons which allows you to select auto/sound mode, blackout, color and direction of rotation. When going through the color modes you can select red, green, red/green together or red/green changing and flashing. You can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music. There is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely, move very fast or slow. The darker the room the better, but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on. I am very pleased with it. I havent tried it with fog but I know it would look great since it has 200 beams. It will work great for any DJ to use on the dancefloor, wall or ceiling. This is a great buy under $100.PROS: It is small, bright, well built and works great. It has a remote to control it.CONS: Transformer on cord and antenna on remote."
1339,67,4.0,"I tried this about 3 months ago. I use Fender 150L's and with it the longevity doubles. I play every day and gig one or two nights. They normally go dead in a week or less. I just did my 3rd weekend with the same set. I put it on when necessary on gig breaks. After practicing, I wipe down the strings first with a cloth and fretboard, then I put the Slick on. Next day, it's not so oily that it bothers me since I don't care for that oily feeling. I just ordered 2 more of these. Obviously, I think it a good product.Update about 2 years later: I won't do without these. They are part of my rig and I always have an extra at home in case it is time to change. They also last quite a long time, maybe 7 months."
805,67,4.0,"Purchased this for my son who plays both Acoustic and Electric guitars. He's absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner! Great buy, prompt shipping, great product!"
129,67,4.0,"Open cap, rub across strings a few times.  Basically, you're done.  If you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over, that works well too. Doesn't leave the strings oily or full of residue.  I will probably clean my guitar strings every time I play now!"
1182,67,4.0,It was great to get quality Christmas gifts that my son was pleased with. The budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town. So thanks to Amazon for making this possible.
613,67,2.0,"This was a precent decent product, I was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings, it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets.  Otherwise, besides that, the cleaner itself is great.  I just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets."
471,67,2.0,"Is kind of good, i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit, tending to sound better for more time and last longer.You just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so I'm not sure if it was worth the purchase. But is a good product.Recommended"
928,67,4.0,"This really cleans your strings. It's fast with a couple of swipes and a lint free towel strings are clean. It comes with a little towel inside the cap but not very efficient, ok if you need it quick somewhere else. Not worth knocking it down for a little towel so I'm sticking with the 5 star!"
525,67,3.0,I got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail.  Saves some money on replacements...I found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so I like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings.  I use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning.
573,67,1.0,"I can't say much about this product.  I tried it twice.  It seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings, but I really didn't notice any great change.  The strings didn't sound betteer or brighter.  Now, it sits in my drawer and collects dust.  Maybe I will try it again at some point, but...."
922,67,4.0,This is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that's been around. It's better because it cleans all 6 at once.
1423,67,2.0,"The Fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new. The great part about it is the design. The fact that it is wide enough to run along all six strings is a definite plus. The things I don't like about it is the top does not close tight enough and can come off during any kind of travel. Once the top is off or just not closed properly, the pad dries out and then it is useless. Also, the little cloth that comes with it is almost impossible to fit back inside the container once you have opened it. As stated it was really good at cleaning and was easy to use but I was only able to use it once because the top came off and it dried out. Unfortunately because of that I would not recommend this item. Go with the Fast Fret."
228,67,3.0,"I requested and received one of these as a Christmas gift, then bought another so I could keep the first one at a weekend place where I keep a guitar. It works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings, and keeps strings clean and rust-free (important here in humid Florida) and strings last longer than they did before I started using this even though I've always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use.I keep my Slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc-type bag because it's not airtight when you snap it together and I don't want it to dry out. I hope when it does dry out that I can just add some juice to rejuvenate it. I just don't know what kind of liquid to use. I don't want to drop $8 or so for a new one every time it dries out. Any ideas are welcome, please add a comment to this review if you can help me out.Bottom line, it extends the life of my strings and that's always good."
202,67,0.0,"I honestly don't see the purpose.  It doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar.  I've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.Edit 5/30/13:After coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened:  This was shipped to me completely dry.  There was no grease/lubricant qualities.  It was like a dry erase pad.  They need to improve their quality control.  I'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star.  They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.I would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out."
323,67,4.0,This is the best string cleaner I have owned to date and I have owned about all of the rest. The way it is packaged makes it super easy to pop the lid and apply it. The casing is tough enough to be thrown into my gig bag and carried all over without the lid coming off or the case breaking. The 'other' string cleaner that is a bottle with cloth applicator spills out and the cloth wears out too fast - then leaves cloth pieces on the strings. This product does not waste the cleaning agent - it applies evenly and there is NO cloth residue left on the strings to pick off. The cleaning agency works so well - it looks like I have cleaned a BBQ grill when I wipe my strings down. Amazing how dirty the strings get after just a few hours of play - this product will get that gunk off. I am done looking for a better string cleaner because this product has the best cleaner in the best packaging for travel. Well done Fender!
1184,320,4.0,While this is not a $300 tape delay...it's a solid pedal that gets it done. It's way better built than other pedals in this price range. I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
1392,320,3.0,"Does everything you'd expect it to do, as well as a couple of things you might not like.First, when run before the amp, it adds a bit of treble to the tone, and a hint of distortion.Not to the point of being unusable, but you guys playing with the &#34;Fender clean&#34; tone might notice. I certainly did.Playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable, as you would imagine.Ive noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop, the treble boost / distortion isnt there, or at least not noticeable. In my experience, of course, YMMV.Those are minor complaints though, as the pedal works well, has more than adequate delay times (up to 600ms) and is built well.I strongly suggest using this with a 9v adapter, because this pedal will eat a 9v battery in a matter of minutes.Overall its a great deal. No, its not as pristine a delay as a Carbon Copy or Boss DD, but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals, and I doubt anyone but you will notice the difference."
518,320,2.0,"I purchased this pedal with good expectations. However, my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged. I tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained. Overall the pedal sounded descent for a $30 pedal but I could not handle the frustration. I traded and another joyo for a Ibanez stereo chorus."
343,320,4.0,"This is a very good quality, nice sounding delay. You can get that classic ""slapback"" sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound. Very simple to operate and that's what makes these Joyo pedals a ""joy"" to use. Nothing fancy, but simple and to the point. Another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely ""true bypass"". I have bought the cheaper, ""plastic"" pedals and they make noise. They say that they are true bypass, but they are not. These babies are dead quiet! I run mine through the effects loop on my Bugera V22 tube amp and it sounds great! I also own the Joyo Vintage OD (TubeScreamer clone) and it is great as well. Highly recommend!!!"
285,320,4.0,I've tried a lot of delay pedals and this delay is easy to use- the sound is clean and crisp - easy to dial in-
1345,320,4.0,"I've gotten a number of these Joyo and Artec pedals now, most from Earth City Sound(TX, mostly on eBay these days) though I recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don't happen to know much about them otherwise.I got this one on a whim just to have a second delay. I've had the DigiTech X-Series multi-delay for many years. The fun thing this Joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy UFO, sci-fi-ish sounds. All one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs. Guitarists who are fans of Yo La Tengo and similar groups, spacey stuff will dig this box. Solid hardware, side mount ac power. Goofy graphics of an eagle though I imagine by now they've updated it's look."
179,320,4.0,"50+ years giggingowned it all 4 or 5 times :)wanted a cheap delay pedal to go into the fx loop of a newly purchased blackstar ht 5c r.since i've purchased several joyo pedals in the last year i looked for a joyo digital delay.it works perfectly, doesnt color the sound, silent switching and the knobs give all the control you'd ever need. it's well built and i expect it to last longer than me :)i highly reccomend this delay pedal."
6,781,4.0,"In my opinion Snark makes the best tuners in the 10 to 20 dollar price range. This particular model has a metronome built in to it, the metros options are a bit limited and the beat can be lost if you are in a noisy environment but for the price I consider I bought a tuner with a freebie built in.The tuner obviously works on mic alone so if the noise level gets too high or the note too soft it doesn't register but for my use (holding my fakebook open while I play mando and harmonica) it works well."
1414,781,3.0,"I bought this not for the tuner, but because I needed a metronome.However, I had to give the tuner a try as well. With my trustySnark SN-1 Tunerattached to my guitar's headstock and this Snark SN-4 on the table, I proceeded to tune my guitar. I was impressed that both tuners were showing identical tuning even down to the fluctuations as the note rang out.As a metronome, I don't know what kind of frills others may offer but this does everything I need to keep in time.I only have one minor complaint. You can't view the Snark SN-4 at any kind of sharp angle. You need to view it head on. If you place it on your music sheet stand, that's great. But if it's not facing you, or lying flat on a desk, you may have trouble reading the screen. An integrated flip out kick-stand would make this perfect."
1028,781,4.0,"I have Snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners, see my reviews.  When I use my music stand, I just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job.  This is that device.I leave it on my stand, and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger, and it's on, and I can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the Snark head tuners.  In addition, this one has a metronome.  I like this very much, and may well buy another.Enjoy!"
1149,781,3.0,"This product has a quiet metronome; in a playing environment, it won't be easy to hear. The tuner works on a mic, and that too will be easily overwhelmed in a social environment.That said, it's lovely to see the strings ""true in."" Makes even first tune-up easy. This accuracy will greatly help to tune the student's ear, making ""by-ear"" tuning possible sooner.Pretty nice. Hate the color.  Oh well."
1076,781,4.0,"This tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that I can't plug into a tuner. Banjo, guitar, mandolin, alternate tuning, even has a metronome for timing practice.Great product, great price."
1149,80,4.0,"The tuner doesn't require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it, so it will work pretty well in a noisy/social environment. Overall, works just fine."
972,80,4.0,does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do. works well with my stuff. recommend
1150,80,4.0,This is definately worth the money. I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all. Bought another one for my friend!
660,80,4.0,"I love the way this tuner works, with a bright screen and easy to use controls. The metronome feature is also a nice addition. It's a bit lightweight, making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once, but it hit the floor many times on me already and it's still going strong :-) This is a great tuner at an even better price, try it out and see for yourself!"
390,80,3.0,It works well with several different instruments that I have. Makes tuning a lot easier and accurate. It is a good value.
796,325,2.0,its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back
808,325,4.0,"I hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good.  I haven't had much chance to play it, but so far so good.  It seems like it is good quality."
113,325,3.0,"This amp is a quality item for the dollar range (I paid $49.99).  There is some question about sound quality and variation in quality.  We purchased two of these, and one arrived with some minor issues, constant humming regardless of volume or EQ settings.  Amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem.This is not a 6000W stage amp, nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors...it has a full punch output at full gain/volume, and can easily light up a back yard.Specs-Input: 1/4"" Mono (not a tip and ring jack)Controls: Volume/Gain and selectable Volume 3-EQ range knobs.  There are two volume controls, once for each side of the push button selector.Outputs: 1/4"" Mono (for monitor or mixer), 1/4"" Dual Mono Headphone jack (tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel).Power:  Lighted front panel rocker switchThe box is very slim and small, about a foot by a foot and 8"" deep, the rear is partially open, speaker exposed, and allows for cord storage.Pros--Portability, easy of use and set up.-Quality finish (leatherette with steel corners) and good construction, 6"" heavy duty lead guitar speaker-Excellent sound and electronics for ANY amp under $100.  There are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are $30-$50 more.  Go with this one.Cons--Units run hot and cold as to quality, but if it works out of the box, it's good, if not, you'll know it as soon as you power it up. Buy with confidence at Amazon from Amazon and you shouldn't have any worries.These amps power two Squier(tm) by Fender electric guitarsSquier by Fender Bullet Strat with Tremolo Bundle with Strings, Pick Card, and Polishing Cloth - Black, Rosewood Fretboardand do a great job.Other accessories for the beginner electric to consider:Cords -Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft,Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 10 feetStrap -Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap, BlackStraplocks -Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System, NickelHanger -String Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary)"
649,325,4.0,"This is my first amp, which I am using with my new Applause AE148-RRB Acoustic Electric Guitar (also purchased from Amazon).  The guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp.  My only complaint is that as a first time amp owner/user I needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with NO paperwork at all.  Not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit I received.  I downloaded the users manual from the Pyle website but it was also not much help.  But just by trying different settings I have managed to find what, for me, is the &#34;sweet spot&#34; for my guitar when paired with this amp.  Very happy with the amp and also happy that I spent the extra few dollars to get the 60 amp rather than the 30 amp version."
437,325,4.0,If your looking for the best.quality smaller.practice amp this is the amp for u it's definitely high quality its got.10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp.definitely the best amp in this.price range i would.definitely.recommend it
1008,315,0.0,"The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don""t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!"
223,315,4.0,I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this. But its a nice cable! No noise or hum whatsoever!
362,315,4.0,"I don't do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound.  It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear.  I like the metal connecters, they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft.It is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price.  I will be buying these again."
32,329,3.0,"Only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not. but it sounds great as ampeg always has, heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp."
660,329,4.0,"For those looking for a solid, well made bass amp to step up to from the cheapies that usually come with beginner bass set ups, this is a hard one to beat. It has 25 watts, a line out for outputting to a PA system or bass cabinet, and an effects loop for adding effects pedals. The design is solid, well made and will go the distance. This is my second one, the first one went two years with zero problems, and I beat it up nearly every day gigging at small venues and just plain abusing it....it took it well. Highly recommended!"
368,329,4.0,"beyond stoked! bought so i could teach my son bass...i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box. ampeg will always build my bass rigs, however big or small"
457,329,4.0,"It might just be my pickups or my strings, but if you set the bass above seven or so, the bass gets fairly fizzy on the E string. The effects loop is useless, and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals, but that's good news because with this amp you don't need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive. So if you ever do use a driven/distorted tone, you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp."
294,329,4.0,"I was really looking forward to receiving this amp. I read the positive reviews and the Ampeg name carries some weight. Unfortunately, from the moment I plugged it in there was this phaser-like effect to the sound. I tried different basses with it. I tried different cables with it. I tried using it in different places, away from computers and fluorescent lights. I tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase-shifter sound came out. I tried all different knob and EQ settings as well. Nothing helped. So, I'm returning it and hoping I just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better. I used to work for an amp manufacturer so I know these things happen and I don't think less of Ampeg, (at least not yet).I really hope it's a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful. For $99 it's packed with cool features like an effects send, a CD in, a Line out for hooking up to a PA and a headphone out for quiet practice. It also just looks cool and very pro. My intention is to use this for a monthly ""bistro"" gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small, so this seems absolutely perfect if I get one that performs like all the other reviews I see here.I have to say, buying from Amazon is the ONLY way to buy these things online. They immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as I filled out the return UPS label. If there is a choice between Amazon.com and other vendors, and even if Amazon is a couple bucks more, I recommend using Amazon. The customer service is so easy and immediate it's worth the piece of mind.I'll update this review when I get the new amp later this week.I upgraded my review based on the replacement I received...see below..."
1290,308,0.0,"I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the ""standard"" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird ""fizz"" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that ""surrounds"" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12"" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is ""something"" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds."
1194,308,3.0,"***Update*** After heavy play for 6 months, this is my favorite amp by a mile. I also have a ZT Lunchbox that I use for church work (miles of clean headroom and designed specifically for pedals). The Mustang III would work just fine, but I can throw the ZT in a backpack with my pedals (I only use an OD, chorus and reverb for church) and it has a lot more volume of I do youth group stuff outside and can't mic up.I have several friends that play music as a primary source of income and 3 of them purchased the Mustang for it's overall lightweight, terrific sound and low price. Played on the clean channels (settings 88-99) with pedals will give you an amazing tone that lets you forget it's not a tube amp - and for the most part, the crowd is clueless to begin with. I did purchase the VOX AC4 and it was so one dimensional and limited it went right back. Terrific for gigs or practice, a back up or just beginning guitar.So this is the 3rd amp I've purchased in a very short amount of time. I traded in my Line 6 and also purchased a Roland Micro Cube. Chalk it up to a new guitar player and a whole world of amplifiers from every price range and style. I bought the Line 6 becuase it had a lot of features and presets that I thought would be really fun. They are, but Line 6 is for metal, despite ""You can play anything on it"" marketing. Turns out I really enjoy playing country and blues (although I listen to punk, classic rock and metal (pre-1995).Enter the Mustang III. It also is feature loaded, but with one kicker. The models of the vintage Fender amps. I have a very close friend that plays a 65' Twin Reverb - he was shocked at the modeling. The Bassman is another that is just off the charts good. The LCD screen is bigger and overall very simple to use. The Vox model is also really jangly sounding - like it's supposed to. I have to add that with Vox in particular, you can get the crunch without having to use massive volume. This is true of modeling amps across the board and a huge advantage over tubes in general. For $300 you can get a Vox w/ an overdrive, delay and reverb. And you can get the full effect with the volume dialed to 3, not 11. It doesn't sound exactly like a Vox - but I don't gig. I'm a basement rockstar - the Mustang gets it done without any problems.Adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive. That's without the FUSE software. I'm not big into recording, so I'm content using it from the  LCD, but the Fuse software is slick. The virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp. The screen is easy to navigate and you can see exactly what effects you're using where they are set at.The only reason I've given it 4 stars is beacuse is lacks low end punch and more importantly doesn't quite have the warmth of a tube amp. To be clear - tube amps sound like tube amps. If you are a metal guy on a solid state budget, Line 6 is still the way to go. If you're more into the old school r'n'r sounds, take a look at the Mustang III. Excellent sounds and value."
366,308,2.0,"I was really interested in the M3 and checked with the Fender forum and I found that there is a problem with the M3.  You can go to the Fender forum and read about it under the Mustang amp section.To make the long story short, some(not all) M3, M4, M5's have what is decribed as a ""fizz"" on the clean setting when hitting the low e string.  Sometimes it's noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible.  Some people think it's the power supply but nobody knows for sure.  Apparently, Fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a 'fizz' problem.  There is also a sample sound clip there on this 'fizz'.Like I said, I just want people to know about this before buying a M3. Now, I am considering the M2 which also has the 'fizz' problem but with the the software fix released from Fender, there is no 'fizz' in the M2. I don't know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because I didn't get the M3, but if I bought it, I would give it a rating of 3 stars because I don't like this 'fizz' on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me.  If it didn't have this 'fizz' I would give it a 5 star rating."
364,308,4.0,"I can't say enough good about this amp. I have a Marshall jcm 800 2203 which is a great tube amp, but side by side this little amp really stacks up. First and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp. But if you want something that is 90% close, well this is it. So versatile, light weight, and well constructed. Great Fender quality for a great price. Love all the presets. I have no problem with buzzing on any channel, clean or otherwise. Excellent guitar amp and I would highly recommend!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!"
506,308,4.0,"I gave it five stars! I purchased this for my young son but I find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does.  I wanted something flexible and decided to buy the Mustang III over the II because of the power and the larger speaker.I've read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what I think about the amp. It sounds great and it has loads of power.  Since it's solid-state, it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end, but for this price?!? Wow! I have no complaints.One thing most have failed to mention is the non-amp features like the input for an MP3 player and the Fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones, creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes. Both Mac and Windows are supported. My son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively. Since he's 11, he doesn't have many opportunities to play with others. He can create jam/click tracks and play along. We also downloaded new firmware from Fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions.People who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks, then upload them to Fender's user web site. We watched a David Gilmour concert and he was inspired. He wanted a tone that sounded like his. We downloaded a few Pink Floyd tones created by other people.  One of them was particularly great. We tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it.  He loves it.Great amp. I can't compare to Line 6 but I can compare it to other amps I've heard. It's pretty nice.  Equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of $$$ on FX."
1380,440,2.0,A cheap guitar at best..no bite to it at all..does not get me excited..learned religoulsy on an acoustic so was excited when i got this cheap from gc for less then 100..low e doesnt stay in tune well pickups suck hard to play being its a jr and just awkward (which is my fault) do love the color and look of it..but thats not what guitars are for right..itll serve its purpose until i can afford a Real American Strat..not great at all..but passable Id return it if i could.
937,440,4.0,"I ordered this Epi Jr because I had one years ago my Son adopted for his own and missed having one. Saw this in TV yellow and had to have it. I came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website. It was set-up very well, among the few guitars I have purchased that were playable out of the box. Fret work is top notch. Finish is good, some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you'll add some of your own. There was a slight binding in the nut, most people think it's the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut. A quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up. If you can't make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech. When you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue. The only thing I did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream. Plugged in it sounds good, you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone. Picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound. Play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in Tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound. Add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region. This guitar will make you a more versatile player. The absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out. Sustain is very good as a result. I could carry on forever but you get the idea. I've been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that. I own many vintage guitars including Gibson, Fender, Gretsch. I have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports, the quality is superb on the most recent ones. Tone snobs may laugh but my new Epi Les Paul Jr plays just as well as most anything out there."
398,440,3.0,"Pretty decent sound, and it's not too small for an adult to play, but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm, jazzy tones you can get. Still very satisfied."
555,440,4.0,"I just thought I would throw in another 5 star review which is based on the cost vs quality factor. I have several guitars, and always thought Epiphone to be an inferior guitar. Well I was dead wrong. It may not have the price tag of my ""better"" guitars, but it sure has the playability and sound. Especially for the $100 tag on it. Great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection. The simple, yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat. I will not shy away from Epiphone anymore. Don't make the mistake of not picking up this guitar only because it's not stamped Gibson."
405,436,4.0,"The instructions could be written much better but I really like having one of these, in fact, I'll probably get a second one to tie to the first one so I can include more instruments.I guarantee, if you get one of these, you'll have a hard time leaving it alone. You can even work it into your live performances."
306,436,4.0,"You may have experienced the problems of musicians. The drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late. But you need to rehearse. This gets the job done, you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want. The thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead, will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack. Otherwise, easy and a great product. The best is, that if you are playing really poor lead work, nobody can hear but you! lol."
1037,436,4.0,"I play bass,...and have for 40 years.  One thing I've come to like a lot about playing music on my instrument is the development of various kinds of sound effects, effects pedals, etc.  Laying down a 'track' or musical run of notes, then building another one over the top of that, and then another, and another once was only able to be done in a studio.  Now, with my Boss RC-3, I can do it any time I want.  In rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful... I can get a couple of rhythm lines going, then have the ability to begin developing a bass lead line to suit,...or play along to develop my 'chops',...whatever is warranted.  This pedal, like other Boss pedals I've purchased, is made to last longer than you (kind of kidding), the electronics have been engineered with nothing but precision and control, and the pedal will do all the manual says it will.  Best bet, watch a few YouTube videos showing its use by a number of musicians.  That helps you understand a lot,...then like me you can buy one and it will bring you playing pleasure for certain."
82,436,4.0,"The Boss RC-3 Loop Pedal is great for playing guitar in a band, or with friends, but also a big help practicing. It comes with 10 pre-set rhythm tracks but the real fun is laying down your own chord sequences with your guitar and then being able to play lead guitar over that rhythm loop with just a quick stomp on the pedal. It makes practicing etc. a lot of fun and meaningful. I haven't figured out all the possibilities yet - and probably never will - but it is a cool pedal to have. Like all Boss pedals, it's as sturdy as a little truck."
1320,436,4.0,"I've read some complaints about this unit.  Maybe those folksshould shell out an additional $300 for something better.To the rest of you, with the 99 storage units, this is a great tool.My band, I to be exact, uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play.  For instance, one of our songs has a difficult drum track.I just loaded the whole pre-recorded track into a slot.Or, one of our songs has a train whistle in the background.  I loadedthe effect into a slot.Or, another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background.  I recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot.Basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need, butdon't have someone else to play it, you can play it back using this device."
240,436,3.0,Another great Roland product.  Really easy to use and well built .... very good sound.  great for practice.  Certainly do not get the RC 2  ... get this RC 3 model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later...I did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big... Check for sales or demos
1134,426,3.0,"This pedal work, although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup. My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough. The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal, even running the delay on the output side of the M195. The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup. I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion."
568,426,3.0,"It does what is supposed to, i'ts a gate, and clamps the noise as good as I expected, at the begining I had problems with power, some how it didn't power correctly, but I was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain, so I solved it isolating the MXR connecting it with another power supply, and it work, so I left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine, also check config and the routing of the signal, this might influence on how it works, I have it right after my Wha and before my compressor, and it works just fine."
461,426,3.0,"I use this every now and then, it does seem to suck tone, but it does reduce noise, though I actually stopped using it and didn't hear much difference! with distortion and reverb, things can get a little noisy in there, but the original tone with everything set up is worth it unaltered. but I will keep this as it will come in handy one day I'm sure."
514,426,4.0,"I couldn't be happier with this pedal. I have a Les Paul/Marshall Class 5/BB preamp/EP Booster/Analog Chorus and Carbon Copy... I used to get this annoying hum and feedback when I cranked the amp up, even when I just plugged the guitar straight to the amp, but those days are long gone, now everything is nice and quiet. I even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job, I haven't noticed any difference in tone so far. I was scared that the Smart Gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it's cheaper, not to mention it has its own effects loop. I don't understand how the Noise Supressor or the Decimator could be better than this one, I mean, the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no."
704,426,4.0,"I don't really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head, as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals. so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it. I LOVE it, bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound, but ingage it with my delays and phase 90's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss. very cool, and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank"
1073,152,4.0,"First off, I'd like to address any construction concerns.  The nanoKontrol2 is actually sturdier than I imagined it would be, despite some of the reviews here.  The case is rigid plastic, as are the rotary knobs and faders, and everything seems pretty solid (I like the travel feel in the faders - not a lot of resistance, but not flimsy-feeling either). The buttons are soft, dense rubber, like a pad controller, and light up when they are pressed. If you have big hands, then you might have issues with using this as a live performance controller since everything is in such a compact space.The supplied mini USB cable fits nice and snug.Bottom line, if you take reasonable care with this unit, it seems like it should give you a lot of dependable service.I tried this right out of the box with Reason 7 - there is no built-in Reason template for it, but it was recognized by Reason when I did a controller surface scan, and it was a piece of cake to map the top knobs to pan controls and the faders to volume faders and the solo and mute buttons to their counterparts on the Reason mixer. Basically, I just bought this to do crossfades, and the nanoKontrol2 will be perfect for that, but I can also see using this to automate some softsynth parameters just as easily.Next, I set this up to control Peff's Directre Rack Extension, and it's a blast!The transport buttons did correctly automap to Reason's transport controls, so you can record, play, stop, fast forward and reverse from the nanoKontrol2.I didn't download the nanoKontrol2 editor yet, but that should increase the utility of this device.If the ""S"", ""M"" and ""R"" buttons lit up in different colors (all lights are red), it would make this unit more useful as a performance controller in my opinion, but as it stands, this budget mixer/performance control surface is well worth $50!"
1130,152,4.0,"Item shipped earlier than I've expected. When I opened the box was surprised as I didn't notice the usb cable. But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was...I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds. It is working fine. Though it has no motorized faders, it doesn't make my work uncomfortable at all. I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it's just working perfect!I recommend it to home studios, also those who travel with recording gear. Nano is small but quite durable.I am happy with it!"
837,152,4.0,After a little bit of configuration headaches I can confirm this product works quite well with ardour2 and is my prefered method of mixing. For the price it's a really good deal.
817,152,3.0,"Windows 7 install worked fine.I use Mixcraft Pro 6 and it's working well.I did have an issue with the drivers, since I had too many midi devices, but the fix wasn't too hard."
141,152,4.0,"Great product for the price!I am using it with Win7 64bit & Sonar XL Producer.I just held down the ""set-marker"" & ""record"" button while plugging the usb cable.I then let Windows 7 Plug & Play the Drivers (No Disk Needed).Next I set Sonar XL Midi Control Surface device as MACKIE & selected the nanoKontrol2 as the Control -Midi in and out.Now I have 8 channels of automation & stop, back, record, play etc.I am very happy with this product so far.I have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!I do not recomend downloading the KORG software if used for SONAR XL.Buttons and sliders and great for the price.Cheers"
1290,168,4.0,"I was hell bent of getting an analog delay and the local shop didn't have the one that I was looking for (MXR Carbon Copy), so they recommended that I try out the TC Flashback Digital Delay instead. This is priced comparably to the Carbon Copy, but it has so many more features (I guess that's expected of a digital delay) that I couldn't pass it up.Similar to the other TC product that I purchased (Corona Chorus), this sounds great, it's feature rich, and easy to use.The analog and tape delay modes do a very nice job of emulating the sound I wanted to get from the analog Carbon Copy, but it also has tons of other settings to pull out a digital sound; think exact repeats and a delay of up to 6 seconds. Shorter delays can be had by switching to the slap back mode, which puts this pedal into instant Rock-A-Billy mode.This is tone print enabled, (a feature that I have yet to try, but it seems like a cool concept), has a tap tempo setting and a 40 second looper all in one small delay box.This is the first delay that I've owned and I'm not looking back."
76,168,1.0,"TC is very overrated.Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion.  The vintage BBDs (MXR Vintage DElay, Morley 70's echo) for example just take it.  But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better."
722,168,4.0,"If you love delay and want variety, this is your pedal.  I run two amps when I play (often) and the ping pong is delightful for me.  However, in the studio, this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options.  Being Toneprint enabled is a 100% plus.  Very clean, quiet, and durable.  Excellence!"
360,168,4.0,This is by far the best delay effects box I've ever used and it has so much potential that it'll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers.  It's also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end.  It is built like a tank and doesn't take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very user-friendly pedal.  Wish all pedals were built this way.  Highly recommended!
2,168,4.0,"It's an excellent pedal well designed, perfect size,incredible quality, if you are looking for a U2 delay's stile it is perfect for you..."
654,168,4.0,"This pedal is a great delay pedal. works well with my marshall,Has a lot of feautures and is very versitale...."
1119,168,4.0,"I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want.1) Boss digital delay: I really didn't like the sound of the delay overall. No real positives to mention2) Carbon copy analog delay : Worked great for cleans. But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone (even though it was in my fx loop). I couldn't get the repeats to duck under the main signal3) Nova Delay : I really wanted to like this. Presets, tap tempo and a nice feature set. But the sound just lacked warmth. It was very digital soundingAt this point I wasn't sure what I wanted. Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy. Digital delays were clear sounding but.. just too digital and uninspiring!I was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline, when I found this pedal. Analog dry signal thru with digital delay !! This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion. Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved. Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect. Sure, it doesn't have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay, this can't be beat at this price range.Sure enough, when I checked the strymon timeline specs, I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay. Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set. But $450+ for a delay pedal is just too much for me.Buy this if you are chasing tone, you won't be disappointed. Skip if looking for presets, tap tempo etc."
249,111,3.0,"Smart design, excellent performance.  What more could you want?  The Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use, with great pick up for desktop podcasts, user testing, screencasting and similar.Being a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic, I had to look up what 'cardioid' meant.  I found a solid explanation at a site called WiseGeek.  They explain 'cardioid':  ""Several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks. Some -- such as condenser microphones -- pick up a great deal of sound from several directions, while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction. Of this latter group, the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular, as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable. It gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity, which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis. This means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone, while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides.""  (My apologies to those pros out there who didn't need this clarification.)Having used the Samson Go Mic USB Compact Mic for a few months, I was familiar with the Samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the Amazon Vine program.  I had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the Go Mic, but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the time.I've been happy with theSamson Go Mic Compact USB Microphone - Plug n' Playfor use with my desktop and laptop PCs.  I do a lot of usability testing for various websites, and it's imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise, pops, hisses or similar.  I have to say that the Samson Meteor is a touch better, offering clear, crisp recording and reproduction.  It also seems to pick up virtually no background noise, which is fabulous!I like the retro styling of the Meteor, and the built-in stand is great for desktops.  Less portable than the Samson Go Mic, the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch.  The included USB cable is also of ample length for easy set-up in a multitude of situations.The mute button on the front of the Meteor is very handy.  Much easier than using software to get the job done, and an amber light makes it easy to recognize it's muted.The build quality of the mic is excellent! Very solid, high-end feel.  You can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the front.The Samson Meteor didn't ship with any software, which while unnecessary for installation (my Windows 7 and 8 PCs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included USB), but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with it.Another product I'm reviewing the:Samson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LEand the Samson Go Mic both ship with Cakewalk software. The Samson Go Mic with Cakewalk Music Creator LE, and the C01UCW ships with Cakewalk's SONAR LE software, so I found it kind of surprising the Meteor did not at this price point.  For me it works out, as the others have the software and they work with the Meteor.The included booklet includes a Quick Start guide for PC and Mac, Installation how-to, the Layout (diagrams), Specifications, Polar Patten & Frequency response, and Recording Techniques for vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, guitar amp, and overhead drum kit.  The Samson Meteor Mic Warranty Card is also in the booklet.Overall, I'm very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the Go Mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using Dragon voice recognition software.  I have purchased an adapter to use it with my iPad so I can play with Garage Band, and know it will be great for future screencasts.My only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package, which other Samson products (as mentioned) have packaged with them. I give this product 4 out of 5 stars (""I Like It"") for this reason.  If Samson included software - it'd be a 5 star product for me."
54,111,3.0,"The product photos make this look like a small, plastic item with cheesy chrome plating. Nope! It's a very solid, fairly large item made of heavy cast metal. You could drive nails with this thing--no exaggeration.The folding legs are clever and provide good support for desktop use, but they have some drawbacks. Yes, the Meteor has standard mic stand threads in its base, so you can put it on a mike stand or boom. But if you want to mount this mic in a shock-absorbing rig (I'm using a scissor-arm suspension boom with shock mount), you'll find the body is too short for the shock mount's sleeve to grip, and the three legs get in the way. I had to make a special adapter from 1 5/8&#34; plastic pipe and assorted hardware.The Meteor's sound is great as far as I'm concerned, but I'm not a professional audio engineer, so I'm not going to try to tell you that this is the equal of a $1,200 Sennheiser studio microphone. It is better than Samson's inexpensive GoMic, which I also have. I certainly have no complaints. I've used it to record voice and ukulele playing, and it's done a bang-up job with both."
599,111,4.0,SUPER usb mic!  I use this when I broadcast from streetjelly.com. I set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal. JUST make sure you have ALL your mic levels set to NOT CLIP and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic.
318,111,3.0,"Perhaps more than anything else, it was the introduction and subsequent success of the Zoom H2 personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles, who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi-professional-level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user-friendly equipment at reasonable prices.  The price of the Samson Meteor USB mic, a fairly recent entry, has come down to the point of being fairly valued (initially, I was seeing it going for prices above the better-sounding Blue Yeti mic).  It's an attractive (some would say ""cute"") little mic with its quaint ""retro"" design and deceptively fold-up, portable size.  I say ""deceptive"" because, due to the non-adjustable mic stand, it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop, next to a computer, and squarely in front of the narrator's mouth.Bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound (it's good, but nowhere close to studio-quality), it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking ""high fidelity"" audio to spend the extra 20% for a Blue Yeti or an Audio Technica AT2020 USB (as tempting as the lower price of the non-USB version of the AT2020 is, be sure to try it out with a pre-amp supplying phantom power before going that route.  I've known a couple of individuals who ordered the AT2020 condenser mic, only to discover that it was useless with a computer, even with the addition of a Snake Light cable).If your primary considerations are convenience and portability, the Samson Go mic sounds almost as good as the Meteor and is unmatched in size, convenience and portability.  (It scored higher than the Blue Mikey and Blue Snowflake in my auditions.)  I'm tempted to say it's the perfect laptop mic, clipping to the top cover more securely than the Snowflake, whereas the Yeti is ideal for desktop use, producing rich-sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio's Shure SM7B mics."
876,111,2.0,"I like everything about this mike, except one: No gain adjustment on the mike. You have to do it from the software. That was a big disappointment, because I had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustment.Of course, if you are just recording talk for podcasts, you probably won't care. But if you are recording instruments (particularly loud instruments), you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps."
294,111,2.0,"Just got this today and I'm experiencing serious install issues. Please note that I'm not a newbie to this stuff. I'm an IT guy. I have a new Acer computer that's less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7. The mic is recognized, but not as a sound input device, just as an ""Other USB Device"". I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily, so it's not that the mic itself doesn't work.My purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you can't just assume that the install is a no-brain'r (at least not on a PC). The Samson tech support was friendly enough, but not very helpful. They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support. The support guy said, ""well, that's really all there is to it"", which I can understand...but I still have a $70 mic that won't work with my computer. I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too, but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device. We tried it a number of ways and nothing worked.I ordered this for use with my iPad as well, and I ordered the ""camera kit"" to do so. Despite what I'd seen in the reviews and videos online, the mic I received would work not with that either. The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in (indicating it's not getting enough power) instead of Blue.I tried this on my wife's iPad and my daughter's too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem (though it could be the camera connector, I suppose.)So...I ended up returning the whole shooting match. Disappointing too...I really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good."
6,875,4.0,"This bag includes several different thicknesses of picks so you can see which fits your playing style best, and the varied colors means the more vain of us can color coordinate our pick and instrument."
484,875,4.0,It was nice to have many types as I had no idea the thickness I would like. It also helped my boyfriend decide also.
1358,875,4.0,It's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like. I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me.
444,875,3.0,I bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio. Most of the band members don't mind them. Its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes. Recommended.
27,255,4.0,I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me.  The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet.  Construction features too well soldered TRS 1/4&#34; male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain relief...but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less.
280,255,3.0,"Good cable and has m et all of our needs.  As all of know who use cables, only time will tell whether they will last."
192,255,4.0,"I was looking for a 25' TRS cable for my band room, I wanted a quality cable with reasonalbe durability although I was willing to compromise some durability for cost and I feel this was an excellent choice. Yes, there are better cables available at a much higher price but I feel this is a well built cable and great value."
51,255,4.0,"It's fairly tough, but flexible.  No noise that I can hear, and the connectors look solidly-mounted.  I would definitely buy this brand again."
1081,465,4.0,I keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall. Its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost. What more could you want?
737,465,2.0,"If your going to use on amp get some two sided Velcro and stick on amp, or two sided tape etc.  For price its fine.  Amazon is the best."
829,465,1.0,"it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor.  I don't trust it and amazon has it way over priced.  It will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place."
1094,465,4.0,One thing tho.  When your guitar isn't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere.  I am going to be finding picks in my files for years.  Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it.
34,465,2.0,"Another excellent gadget from Planet Waves. What a great idea. Already has made my life easier. Keep a pile of Jazz IIIs in the concave pocket (shallow depression for holding stuff). I don't own any very expensive guitars, so I'm not concerned about resting their bodies on my carpet. The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible, and that means... you're more apt to grab your axe and play more.When un-weighted by the guitar neck, the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily. No big deal at all.*****************************EDIT: Just purchased another one -- an axe close at hand is an axe you will play. That's been my experience. After living with this for a few days one thing has become an annoyance: when there's no guitar holding it to the table, it's very easy to knock it off the desk. The way it is designed is such that the leverage has a see-saw effect that will have it fly a few feet across the room. Because it sticks out horizontally, just a nudge with a knee and there it goes. So if you have picks or anything sitting in the round holder area, it can be an annoyance.I do use these for my guitars, but I feel much more comfortable using a proper stand. The product is worthwhile for a quick location for setting down your axe without searching for a stand.If the product had a way of either using suction or tab to secure itself to a surface it would earn another star."
1028,465,4.0,"The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles!  I just got one, and have used it for a few days, and it's the bomb!  I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over.  This product is a rubber disc with small ""arms"" in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface, and you can set your instrument against it, and voila, it doesn't fall over!  Here at home, I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase, and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove, heel on carpet, neck in Guitar Rest.I'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases, because I can use them at one of my uke parties.  If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor, for instance, to take a whizz, they're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them.  Here, I just find a spot near wherever I'm sitting, and it becomes my ""lean"" spot, and I can even set my beer can on the round part on the back!  Coaster uke/guitar holder.  It's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument.  I could carry a metal stand with me, but it wouldn't fit in my ukulele case--this Planet Waves product does.  A winner."
1005,465,3.0,"This is a pretty cool product. I have mine next to my computer, because I am constantly waiting on video to render, and I am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down; this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand. It is also good to have when I am using Garage Band, and need to set the guitar down for a second. If you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it won't work, the guitar wobbles and falls out; but it works great on carpet. The pick bucket is a nice touch, keeps picks from scattering all over my desk. The rubber is very grippy to my wood desk, and never moves. I would recommend this."
1055,465,2.0,"Maybe they included some sticky pads and I missed it? This thing is great in theory, but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesn't have a guitar resting in it.It does well at its job when it's in use, i.e. it doesn't fall when there's a guitar, but I think I'll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it's lying in wait. ;)"
812,465,3.0,I bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home ( he has guitars everywhere). I am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose - only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars.  It is pretty good at staying in place though
1285,465,4.0,"Genius idea that I wish I thought of first. I actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent, but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place. I would definitely recommend!"
1177,465,3.0,It is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor.  As long as the guitar is on it works great.
1051,465,2.0,"I've had this thing for several weeks, and just now, when it fell off the table for the 100th time, I tossed it in the trash.  The whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber, it's not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck, and it's not heavy enough to stay put.  Even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over.  Unless you glue this thing to the table, or something like that, it's useless, even worse than useless, it's in the way.Addendum:  I raised the rating a bit, after hearing from the distributor/manufacturer ... at least these guys listen."
971,465,2.0,I never use it so I really only wasted my money. I have rather high end guitars so placing any of them other than very securely is not a good way to go..
366,465,3.0,"As the title, it works the way it's supposed to.  But I wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it won't move easily.  Nevertheless, it's a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground.  Just remember, use some common sense, don't expect the guitar to totally stable."
733,465,3.0,Good product! But I'd expected more robust on your structure. But it's good product! Don't have adhesive to bind on the surface.
338,465,2.0,"This can work, but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money. It will work if you use your guitar next to the a table."
893,465,4.0,This was a Christmas gift from my husband.  It is such cool and easy rest for the guitar.  I took it with me to our bi weekly jam and the other musicians were considering buying some for themselves.
122,465,3.0,I think this guitar rest is pretty nice. It doesn't attach on the table very good though so  don't rely on this thing too much.
460,465,0.0,"A great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality.  if you don't have something heavy on the flat end, the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground.  I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but I'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open.  The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work."
833,465,3.0,"There's just no way I'm going to give five stars to a piece of rubber. That's what this is. It doesn't even look quite as good as the picture, largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up. Without those picks, it's just black molded flab.The damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful. I bought this on a whim and cringed when I opened up the box. But for the last two weeks, it's been propping my Takemine up against a coffee table. The rubber is thick enough and non-skid enough that it keeps the guitar in place. Effortlessly. It may not be much to look at, but it works really well.The top portion that rests on a table surface is about 1/4 inch think. There's a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place. That's about 5/8 inch thick. The cost of materials is probably not more than 50 cents, but it's the design that sells this thing.If you can find this for less at a local shop, go for it.  I paid Amazon $6. Even at that, I consider it a good buy."
710,465,4.0,"Those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years, this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars."
294,465,2.0,I just can't trust it! I thought it'd be a good idea if I needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute....but I just can't get myself to do it. I always end up using a little Fender portable stand. It does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp.
978,465,3.0,"This product is worth having if, like me, you find yourself needing a place to quickly ""park"" your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand. I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand. Works great -- only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside, or a way of semi-permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn't move around. I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed. Overall -- I like it."
410,753,4.0,"This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument.(I got mine with free shipping)Built like an instrument, not a toy, it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele. Fun to play, easy to take along, stays in tune well enough, and it's only a hundred bucks. I bet if you bought one you would like it."
1284,753,3.0,"I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long & McQuade located in Canada.  It's the same as the one Amazon is selling here.  I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele.  My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways.  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way.  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch.  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E.  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads ""A"".  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar.So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice.  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play.The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions.  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it.  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff.  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good.  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho.  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music.  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele.  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price.I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets. You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments.I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4.10.13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it.  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!"
946,753,3.0,Im a man on the move and am constantly away from home. I take this bad boy with me everywhere to satify my need to pick 6 strings.  great for takin to the beach or on the boat or to entertain yourself on long car rides.
107,753,4.0,"This little Guitarlele is great - I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well. It gives a gently subdued tone, that is perfect for playing any time, even accompanying music on the TV whilst the family are watching. I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six months.Added info:Now that the tuning has settled down, it is keeping tune very well, with no need to retune during playing.The strings it came with are not the best though, they are wearing through all ready."
942,25,4.0,I love this stomp box although I never stomp on it :-)  Needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you.  My amplifier doesn't have reverb so I route the effects send to it and leave it on.  It has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldn't think about playing without it...
991,25,4.0,"You have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal; the only think I can think of is moderately high power consumption, so I suggest using the power supply rather than batteries.It is a joy to play almost any style with these, though I prefer jazz/blues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortion.Oh yes .. the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks. Very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range."
842,25,4.0,"Studio grade reverbs in a small box, if you are looking for a reverb with a lot of options and in a small unit this is it.  Another &#34;I can't say enough about it&#34; pedal from TC Electronics, worth checking out if you're looking."
681,25,4.0,"This is one of the best pedals I have on my board. I originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this. I was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect, which can be breathtaking. The settings are all quite useful (Church, plate, spring, hall, room, gate etc) and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay. There is also a toneprint setting which is nice, but honestly, the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound, the toneprint seems redundant. I leave this pedal on most of the time - along with my Corona chorus and Flashback delay. It is part of &#34;my sound&#34;."
350,25,3.0,"Most the reverb selection sound identical. They all sound good. I would say that the Boss reverb pedal sounds better. I use this pedal in my pedal chain. It doesn't get much action, my amp has a reverb. I was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar."
1026,25,4.0,No loss of initial tone with this pedal which was #1 on my priority list as I love the sound of my guitar and amp.  The &#34;hall&#34; setting is phenomenal.  Transparent in your signal chain when off as well!  Love it.
487,25,4.0,"Well , at first i was looking for a reverb with a long and deep sound, like a grail or church, then i read about this tone print thing and i really like it, this give you a totally new range of sound based on a specific artist preset, so you can have a bunch of tone prints that you can download from the webpage, the only thing  that could be better is the instructions on how to download the tone prints it doesn't came with the instructions, although is really easy but at first i was blindfolded, but overall it is great."
70,25,4.0,"This is the first and only TC Electronic product I've ever purchased.  I watched the Youtube demos and liked what I heard.  It has exceeded my expectations. The reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak. The Toneprint feature is amazing.  I downloaded ""Church of Andy"" preset from the TCE website and just love that patch.  Downloading is quick and easy.  I created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available Hall of Fame patches so whenever I want to change it out, I don't even have to go on the Internet to get it.  There is an iPhone/iPod4gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal. Don't ask me how it works, but it does.  I will probably buy more TC Electronic pedals in the future."
462,25,2.0,But it's a real step up from the effects on my Vox Mini 5 amp so I'm only going to complain too much.  It actually cost more than the behringer amp I'm running it through which seems a little odd to me.
654,25,4.0,"nice reverb pedal, got rid of my boss reverb. the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase 90, if they made these pedals I'd probablybe all tc electronics! What else can I say!!!!"
1071,25,4.0,"This is an absolutely amazing Reverb pedal.  TC toneprint is very much a novelty, a very useful one at that if you want to dial in some really nice presets. Where this pedal really shines is in it's endless ability to tweak the parameters using the downloadable editor. You can spend hours finding &#34;Your Sound&#34; or just &#34;The Sound&#34; that you need. High quality chassis, excellent switch and input/output jacks that give a satisfying thunk, indicating your cable is secured.  Don't forget to lift the back panel to adjust the dipswitches to change the true bypass, tone dry through etc... All and all a great one stop reverb pedal with tons of tone and potential that should last a lifetime."
83,25,4.0,"I bought this unit because my amp doesn't have reverb. But I discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds. Even when I use a reverbed amp, I turn it off and use my Hall of Fame."
1170,387,4.0,"really you hate warm, sustaining, natural-tube overdrive; you won't like it at all. This is my favorite OD pedal that I have. I have compared it to the Vox ValveTone OD, the OD side of a EHX Germanium4 BMP, a EHX Linear Power Boost(my second favorite), an Ibanez TS5(90s model) and a Boss Fender Bassman FBM-1. They all have their uses but I find the MojoMojo to be the most versatile, warm and punchy OD I have. I pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive. This thing really wants to sing to you. There are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers. That's not to say it doesn't have some serious punchiness on the low end, which it does; so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups. I pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers. Single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and I am guessing that's why there is the voice switch.The knobs/pots are nice and the bass/treble pots are notched at 12. Turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts. The drive goes from really clean and subtle, like a  mild boost, up to super drive territory. I actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a Fulltone OCD, it just sounds a little more livelier to me. I really like to push this pedal into the Fender Bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey bell-like highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the FBM-1, as a third channel of sorts, and it sounds like a totally different amp stack.Like I said, this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time I have had it. I was using the EHX Linear Boost to perform these duties before, and it performs well, but the soulful tone I get from the MojoMojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesn't. I play mostly original compositions but I am going for the Jeff Beck tone and this helps me get where I want to go.Of course none of this means I will stop buying OD pedals... |o)"
175,387,4.0,"There really is nothing not to like about this pedal..a) 2 band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than most,b) then drive goes from clean to solid overdrive..c) level control provide from -ve to high +ve boost.With drive set to 3pm and level at 2pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior.. really nice, roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch, roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volume.highly recommended.."
1306,387,4.0,"TC makes very high quality pedals, and this thing is built like a tank. I've had it for over 2 years and done many gigs, and a couple tours and all my TC pedals are in perfect condition. Now for tone, this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when I'm leading worship n my band, we play heavier music, so I was messing around with this overdrive so I could use it there as well, and I discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal, it makes your tone really muddy, but if you send a dirty tone (overdrive or light distortion) into it, it screams beautifully."
654,387,4.0,"what can I say, this pedal has never left my pedalboard. is very versitable pedal. from a boast toalmost full out distortion that doesn't loose the sound of the buitar. cool pedal!!!!"
942,800,4.0,"Being a musician I wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams.  With the support of this little recorder I have about 95% of what I have played over the last year available to me.Sound Quality - there are many options to select from, sample rate, type (mp3, wav) and a number of other options.  I have mainly recorded wav at 192, when I am done recording I normally will edit it in a DAW and then convert to mp3 for storage.  I would say the audio is good, not great, but certainly right on for what I am doing considering the price.  Power is about 4-6 hours of continuous recording.  I can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the Gb card.  This is usually a little more than I require when jamming.  I have used the USB power when available and that has performed well.I have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels.  Many times at a jam  you don't necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally.  Several times it had to sit next to the drummer, or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case, and I was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments, but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated.  One instrument may be louder than another but then I tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance.The only times it has failed has been I didn't have enough battery, I didn't format the card and it ran out of room or I forgot to press the record button TWICE before recording.  The first arms the track, the second begins the recording.  For the price I bought two and just keep one in my guitar case...  I have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder, just the external mics."
963,800,4.0,"Works great, sounds great, it's a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate. Tascam rocks."
1014,800,2.0,"Basically very good.  The buttons are fairly intuitive but some basic functions are incongrously hidden beneath multiple layers of menus.  The sound recorded, while crystal clear is a little on the quiet side even after adjustment of the record and play back features."
509,800,4.0,
634,800,2.0,"This recorder is okay but it's far from perfect. No, I didn't expect it to be perfect but still, I refuse to give it more than 3 stars. It seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely. However, other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible. I use this to practice with a band, and then I'll just listen to the arrangement later so I can practice by myself. For this much, I have no complaints. Besides that, I would never use this if I wanted a decent quality recording of anything."
318,800,4.0,"Until 5-6 years ago there was a virtual void in high-quality personal digital recorders.  Then the Zoom H2 came along, and numerous variations on a theme were soon to follow.  I've owned both the H2 and the H1 and, though both have their strong points, the Tascam DR-05 has served me better than either. The H2 has pleasing 4-point sound and the H1, at half the size of the Tascam, works well for ""stealth"" as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera.  But both recorders are more complicated than necessary, with tricky menu systems, excessive tiny buttons (6 on one thin side of the H1), and dicey build quality.The Tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine that's a pleasure to use.  There are no shaky, rattling parts, the controls are solid and instantly solved (easily manageable with a single thumb), and the wide-spread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music (for dictation, I use a separate, small mic inserted in the topside input).  The machine reminds me of the far costlier Sony PCM-50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation. The Tascam's 320 kbps MP3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically ""present"" than its 96/24 WAV files, and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum.  If you don't have $500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for day-in, day-out use, this is the one."
1202,800,4.0,i had a dr-07 that i loved but it mysteriously walked out during a gig we played at a local bar.  i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less.  i never used the reverb or overdubbing capabilities of the dr 07 anyway and i usually used it with the mics folded in.  i have recorded several rehearsals with this one and i cant tell a difference between the recordings i made with the dr 07 and the recordings from this one.  this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals.
356,414,3.0,This is not top of the line but for the price is a good deal.  I don't think it lastforever but it works great for my Peavey Patriot Guitar. I would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar.
516,414,3.0,"I purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive Epiphone Les Paul Jr, which fits perfectly (as does a Squier Strat.)On the plus side, the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some (but not a lot) of abuse.The reason I claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear. That should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this. One other issue I've had with the case is I left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges, especially the lip around the top of the case. Again, this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot, enclosed space for prolonged periods.For inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument. It is perfect for occasional gigging, but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road. I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because I do like the better protection this particular case provides."
615,414,1.0,"I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work.  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case.  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing.  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed.  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case.  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag.  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment.  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better.  I have a Musician's Gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all."
235,414,4.0,this is a great value. i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series. it fits perfectly. thank you
835,286,3.0,Like many here the case could be an inch bigger.  For my Ibanez 510  I cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back.  Now mine closes without pressure on the bridge.
1100,286,3.0,"We have my grandpa's really old Mandolin now, so my dad and I wanted a nice case for our 70 year old mandolin. I saw this case and thought that maybe it would work. Well it works just fine, the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well.Now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there!"
1140,286,4.0,"I couldn't believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price. Especially given what I paid for it, this case is unbelievable... velvety cushioning inside, heavy-duty outside, and a little compartment for picks or capos (I can't fit much else in there but I don't really need to). A few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze -- at first, I didn't think my Ibanez mandolin fit in here, but when I finally applied some pressure, it went right in. Now that I've been using the case for a while it seems broken in, and I don't have to fight it so much to get it to close.The only downside is that after a few uses, the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge. I used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it's on the bottom, it's not very noticeable, but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through. I didn't take a star away for that as it's purely cosmetic, and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin, I can forgive some tape on the edge. In this case, I still got more than my money's worth."
1416,286,4.0,"It's a good quality case. I wouldn't check it as luggage when flying, but it's small so bring it as a carry-on. It'll protect your mando just fine."
801,286,4.0,"I got one of those for my next mandolin after my Johnson. I couldn't see spending 40 bucks for a case for a 50 dollar instrument, so I didn't. However, the next one cost a few hundred and I got one of these cases that has served me well. These are pretty soft inside and fit most A-styles pretty well. The hardware is decent but I wouldn't expect the hinges to last forever. They'll be easy enough to fix/replace when they fall off, so no worries there.If I had a $2500.00 Gibson/Weber/Whatever, I wouldn't buy this, I'd spend the money for a really nice case, but since I don't, I didn't. If you DO have an expensive instrument and want to cheap out, these really are decent little cases but you won't mistake it for a really expensive one, and that's fine.If it's still built like my case (never can tell these days...) it'll have a little storage compartment that will hold a bunch of pics, capo and a little tuner with no problem. Not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there."
1122,422,4.0,"I order this for my Glen Burton cutaway. I had it in a gig bag, but acoustic guitars shouldn't be in a gig bag. I got tired of my guiitar being banged around in the back of the car so I ordered this hardshell case. It is wonderful. Very well made and beautiful. It came to me right on time with no problems at all. It also has a lock on it so you can lock your guitar up so no one will get in to it. It is a little heavy, but that is something I can get use to. My guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug. I love this case and it is worth every dime you pay for it, maybe even more."
778,422,4.0,"I am the kind of guy that fixes everything with duct tape and when the item is more tape than product I go to a pawn shop and buy something used and start the process again. I saw this case and thought 50 bucks and it's for my favorite guitar, so I purchased it. 2 days later it was sitting at my back door (and I didn't have to pay shipping). This thing is a beauty! Plush interior, hardware looks great and good quality. Does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type. Deep storage pocket and more. My 12 string fits in it w/room to spare and its' case is running out of room to tape so I guess I'll be purchasing another soon."
137,422,2.0,"The odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.Size and fit were good. The storage compartment is nice and large.One hinge broke after about a year of normal use. It was in the house almost the whole time, I just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done. I noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. It is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.This was not an expensive guitar, and I had a better case, so I switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that I really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage."
700,422,4.0,"I bought this guitar case for wife, as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her &#34;GIG bag( soft case) with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could. She absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it, it makes you think that this case should cost more, but for the $60, it is an awesome deal.The case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her Mic cable, DI box , picks and tuner. Underneath the neck, there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings. You  might pay more for a NAME brand case...save some money for soemthing else an dget this case, because it is a great deal. We found nothing negative that we could say about it. It also was packaged VERY well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick."
1206,422,4.0,"I honestly don't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too. I've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more. This is a hard shell tolex covered case. They are sturdy, well padded with plush black lining, and look as good as cases costing much more. These cases are made for dreadnought guitars, and I bought two of them. One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly. The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys. It's made in China, but isn't most everything these days? I wouldn't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage, but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions. I don't think you'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases!"
615,422,3.0,"I bought this recently for $40 to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades.  For $40 it's an awesome deal.  But objectively, when compared to an Epiphone 335-style case I bought last year for $81, it's deserving of 4 stars (which isn't bad, just not great):PROS:  Decent build quality; four buckles (one locking) and three hinges; very nice plush lining; not heavy; knobs on bottom so it stands on end; knobs on side and back so it's never directly on the floor; fits a dreadnaught well.CONS:  Not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut; the one locking buckle wouldn't stop anyone; the big front and back body panels flex more than they should; exterior covering feels somewhat cheap; the handle is hard plastic and not padded.So for $40 it's a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard, but it doesn't measure up to a basic Epi 335 case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes.  It also had a strong chemical odor, but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away."
1382,422,4.0,"It fits well, close well, protects well, transport well! What more can I ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases.  Have not have it that long to rate the durability but I like this case."
47,844,3.0,"I wasn't sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since I was just starting out.  I bought this to work with Rocksmith 2014 and it did the job just fine.  The guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible.  It turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage.I put new strings on it and fixed the intonation, adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height (all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar) and it sounded a lot better. Unfortunately there's no 22nd fret on this guitar.  That probably shouldn't come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have 21 frets, but there's this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the 22nd fret...The single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn't pick up much of that hum, or else you resort to using the 2nd and 4th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum.I think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too.  I haven't gotten that far yet.  I've had it since February, changed strings on it twice (in 4 months) and so far it's proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on...except for that 22nd fret (oh well)."
1016,844,3.0,"All guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there. They vary a bit, but basically you have a light, 3 pickup, versitale guitar that does that job - that is about it. But this Legacy, which I can see as I am typing, is much more.First, the natural finish is what got me started. It seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads. I looked at $700+ Fenders, but except for the natural finish - what was I getting for $700? I wanted a strat copy that I could customize - this is IT!. I am putting split hot rail-type pickups in this, and WOW I have a strat, 3-pickup LP, and anything in between.Get one!"
1225,844,4.0,"1. If you are totally a beginner and have nothing to begin with, get this guitar and a Vox amplug AC30. Use it with your headphones or home speakers.2. Don't upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level. Prepare $1000 for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade. If your budget is below that, don't bother and save more.Speak from experience, I've tried a lot and did many research. This guitar with amplug just sound amazing! Plus, it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out. Guitars and amps below $400, yes there are good stuff, but you're more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter. For a budget around $1000, if you don't go professional, you will be happy with them forever. So do yourself a favor, one shot, no waste of time and money.This guitar is good enough for any beginners. Most under $400 guitars don't have good pickups, so why spend extra money? (Again, my bloody experience taught me that.I've spent time and money, way more than $1000) Free advice.I strongly recommend this guitar, it has no fault towards its price."
852,844,4.0,"Not knowing much, and after using for a couple of months, I'm pretty happy with guitar for the money I paid for it.  Fit and finish is quite nice.  Just needed tuning.  Great beginner model.  Feels solid and stay's in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions."
1249,844,4.0,"I figured I'd buy a cheap second guitar, so I found this one. One of the cheapest prices on Amazon. And I thought wow, what a great look this guitar has. I was also hoping that it played well. Well I've been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good, and I've had no technical issues what so ever. I would recommend to ANYONE. Keep up the good work! =)"
1007,844,4.0,"I acquired this recently, I did not need another strat style, or copy of, but it's white....just gotta love that vibe? Anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good, here's a few add ons in case... It's routed hsh under the hood but looks tight.. Think it's bucker size upgradable; top and bottom didn't measure, I like single coils...the white is a poly finish (love poly durable and crack/fade resist) and exquisite nicely done, alder body but it's hefty alder, like 8lb or so. Not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice, too nice to change like I was thinking till I got it... Nice quality control on these, really smooth rosewood board with med-jumbo (that's what I call anyway) frets good fretting. Standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed, no missed screw holes etc. Was set up with standard action etc, out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc. great fit and finish, best I can tell its a standard f type plate, if interested looks to be easy changer.Overall it's a solid piece, assembled well, for me the body and neck is what seals the deal, better then most out there this range... It is alder and hefty, but durable. I look to change most hardware in time so won't comment on that, what's there... is installed well...2 things I forgot tuners wanna say 15:1? 10mm standard import style... Seem good, not legendary and tremelo/whammy standard zinc block (there's the must upgrade part...) it's standard 10.5 string space import, I got one pet peave; it's steel or brass blocks... A shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks, my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem, the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe 50$ best money ever spent... I can't afford the gotoh or Callahan stuff, On this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you'll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better. Also the neck I say nice but I mean it's nicer than most in the shape, it's slightly chunky c shape? Not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 1-3 it's beefier? I have avg. size hands, I find it's a good fit.In all... If your looking in this price range it's nice, and upgradable as you can or learn more."
437,844,4.0,This is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for 300$ bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers.
343,844,4.0,"I am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar! I got the natural finish and I am blown away at the beauty of this thing! Mine arrived in perfect condition. Will only need a minor setup. The intonation was surprisingly spot on and the strings are actually alright to practice on for a while. If you are looking for a great quality strat for under 90 bucks, then don't hesitate and order one of these babies!"
1259,844,0.0,"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!"
172,844,4.0,"This Is one great piece. The quality of the guitar is Amazing!!! and for Its price Outstanding!! It plays Beautifully with my 100w amp. And with my experience of guitars, this is a go getter, otherwise I would see this one stand out to a $300 Les Paul!!!"
548,844,4.0,"I don't know if 39"" (from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body {I know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that} ) is the normal size for an adult...However for $50 (its on sale at the time) even if its not I can still learn to play since thats why I bought it is to learn...The pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn't really affect anything, since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine.All togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good.I am happy with it.Good clean sound, at least with my headphone amp (only amp I have).Comes with Whammy bar(thats what I know it as), one volume, two tone, the pickup sector switch, the cord that connects your guitar to your amp.**EDIT**So now that Amazon has grouped the guitar with many others (mostly the color differences) and that I have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar, not saying much really but a little bit, I have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume... Not much of an issue, for me at least but worth mentioning."
751,2,3.0,"This unit works as advertised.  I've used it to record my garage band shows.  Making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice.  Buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds (e.g., audience and any other background noise), so if you want a more pure sound, you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments, microphones, etc."
963,2,4.0,"If your a musician (or want to be?) recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well.

Enough said, buy a Tascam if you serious about your music."
269,2,2.0,"The use of the device was moderately difficult.  The primary difficulty was in the how the user's manual was written.  The information is not straight forth, and the ""how to"" especially on setting up the device was severely lacking.  This left me to the old plug and chug method.  Once I figured out how to set it up...I found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker.  The DR did sound better with ear buds, but still was short of what I expected based on the reviews on Amazon and other websites.  The good things though is that it is light, portable and the mics can be moved.  I wasn't expecting bose type of sound, but I wasn't expecting to hear the tin man either."
1266,2,4.0,"I waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it, I didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understanding.It works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas...$12 16GB Sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time, but the Tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip.... it sounds good natural and spacias...get it...I paid $110 shipped for mine, so look on Amazon or Ebay for purchase...the big music stores always mark up the prices very HIGH...zzounds, musicians friend sweetwater music 123, dont buy from them...Jim"

1311,2,4.0,"I bought this in 2012 to record music classes and workshops that I take in both acoustic / fingerstyle guitar as well as electric guitar, bass and percussion.  All of those environments are very different and require different approaches otherwise you'll wind up with only mumbling or with the sound blown out.  The DR-07MKII has worked well for over 100 classes recorded.This unit has been great for picking up the human voice about 20 feet away while it has been sitting on an extra tilted music stand.  With it set to auto level then I can take it to a loud percussion class or electric band class and it quickly adjusts itself to the environment.You can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually.  I've needed to do that for classes that involved a lot of lectures but then bursts of high sound.  I was willing to let the bursts clip so that I didn't miss the human speaking around them.One little feature that I now love is the fact that you can preset the file names and it uses them followed by a number to create next file.  I set them for certain venues that take classes or even a class name if I know that I'm going to be taking only that class for a few weeks.  This makes it easy to copy to my PC and keep organized."
1082,2,4.0,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and ""kicking"" the tires of this one and it's competition.  I will tell you up front my decision to buy the DR-07MKII over the Zoom H1 came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer!  I'm a musician and a wanna-be videographer, since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test I read about (DR-07MKII vs Zoom H1) and listened too on YouTube I decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same size.Most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians.  Tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between $150-200 and don't even have high quality microphones, so discovering I could toss an MP3 of the song I was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise. This is the better choice for musicians.Other features I appreciate about the DR-07MKII, the adjustable microphones, quick turn on and being armed to record, the file system, the low battery consumption.I should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record, after all, everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up, power it up and start recording.  Well, I got a recording without sound!  The unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero.  Once I figure that out all was right again in my universe.  You will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation.  I found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first, a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing.  The more aggressive recording level solved that problem.I purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it, after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process.  I have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results. I still don't know how I will solve the  wind noise issue when recording ambient sound (microphone capsules facing out) since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the XY pattern position.  I'm sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though.For my video work I use inexpensive hd capable camcorders. My new fascination is with the Song Bloggie (swivel camera lense), they are inexpensive now ($50 on Craigslist these days) and with the DR-07MKII all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality I get from the Bloggie.One last detail, at the point of purchase I discovered Amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the DR-07MKII to the same price point as the Zoom H1... win win!  I got what I expected with my purchase, you will too."
1322,2,3.0,"This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians, but for Amateur musicians (like me), If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play, then you're fooling yourself.  You have to listen to your mix by recording it, then listening while you're not playing/singing."
1126,144,4.0,"I could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor, reverb pedal, harmonizer, ring modulator, etc.  The Line 6 M5 seemed like a good way to have a ""jack-of-all-trades"" pedal on my board for those times I needed one specialized effect.  I have to say that it serves that purpose in spades.I have an all-analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers.  I was wrong to worry; digital has come a long way.  Almost all of the effects sound great to my ear, especially into a tube amp.  True bypass means no tone suck to boot.High points for the delays, reverbs, and mods.  I am not a fan of all of the drives but the Overdrive and Boost Comp sound pretty awesome.  The Rat model ""Classic Distortion"" sounds exactly like my ProCo Rat2.  Wish I could say the same for the Big Muff model but I guess they couldn't get them all right.The only issue is I liked it so much I could not resist the urge to get the M9 so I can run three effects simultaneously.  However, if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the M5 is a winner."
120,144,1.0,"I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time, good though they were. Too expensive foronly one effect at a time. Returned it."
861,144,4.0,"Make sure you get a Diago power supply or one that can deliver more than 500MA the one sent from Line6 is only 250MA, huge error from L6!"
1403,144,3.0,"I decided to try out the M5 in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board. While I haven't explored all of the sounds yet, I have found some useable ones.You really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets. Flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation. Also, factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much.Here are some that I've personally found to be appealing so far:Delay: Analog w/Mod- a nice sounding Memory Man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalReverb: Room- standard adjustable digital delay, not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicEnvelope Filter: Tron Up- a Winner! fully functional and authentic envelope follower, FUNKY!Synthy: Seeker- a very cool filter for single guitar notes.Octave: Bass Octaver- One note below only but quite effective especially for loopers.You will also find (as expected with a multi-effects pedal) many unpractical, downright silly-sounding noise makers. Not to say you won't find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we're talking about a 4:20 headphones session ;) Also, don't depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you're using it as an addition to your amp's lead channel.Construction seems pretty sturdy other than the ""Model Select"" button which is a multi-use knob with push-down / turn action and is cheapy-cheap. It's awkward and uncomfortable to use, fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up. I already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets.Having the choice between True-Bypass and DSP is a really nice touch (and unheard of on stomp boxes) as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain.The tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position. I do miss my KORG Pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection.I personally wanted things like octave, envelope, phaser, etc. available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually. The M5 is serving that purpose. The sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist. They should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone. Just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package."
83,144,4.0,"This single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects. A lot of overdrive/distortions, filters, modulations, delays, reverbs, all carefully modeled. I put M5 side-by-side with the &#34;real one&#34; with a A/B switch, and don't heard differences. I'm using in musics where I need programed delays (like U2 or Pink Floyd) or when I need a specific effect - I only use Tremolo in 1 music, and this gear help me to save my money."
149,144,4.0,"I really like the delays and the reverbs on this pedal, i recomend this model, it will work if you need a lot of effects in one box, it really sounds great, the distortions sounds great too."
226,127,4.0,"When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion. But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised. It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal. It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. It's truly a one of a kind product. I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. Make a note it is not a metal pedal. Not by any means actually. But for what it is it is fantastic."
969,127,3.0,Cool pedal on a clean amp. I ran it into my dual gain amp and it just muddied the sound up. I am buying an old twin head that I want to try this on for a little vintage grit. I think it will work great for that.

Still, I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall sound-like roar JCM-800... and this guy did the job! It's not a Riot, but... pretty much defends its self from the old 70-80s songs. Love it!"
704,127,3.0,"Like the name implies some very cool sounding 70's distortions, not overbearing so your pickups and amp tone still stay in their, I like the mod switch in the top left corner, sounds good with my compressor infront (MXR).  so ez to use and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and to last"
1304,127,4.0,"I bought this pedal wanting classic distortion and find it more useful as an overdrive pedal. The distortion range does not get as hot as a RAT or MXR classic distortion but it sounds great with a telecaster and tube amp. I use it with a cigar box guitar also for fun and the tone ranges from 60's and 70's distortion to 80's metal. I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an example.I like that the pedal has a wide array of uses. The build quality seems questionable from MXR. As others have posted, the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXR's, espeacially the older ones, but this pedal seems solid and makes no noise.The price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it. I have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way. I would steer clear of this if you are looking for a pedal for metal and definately buy it if you are into classic rock, twang, and blues."
994,127,0.0,"Well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it.  Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for.  Guess that's why it's so cheap."
1157,127,4.0,"Wanted to review this pedal because I felt some of the other reviews were a little lukewarm.  Distortion is incredibly subjective-it depends on your rig and your tastes. But the Badass '78 by MXR is a very nice pedal for a decent price.  It doesn't do metal or super high-gain, but offers some nice classic rock tones and can be quite warm if you back off on the tone knob. The crunch button adds brightness and volume and may or may not be too harsh for your setup.  However, the tone knob does do a pretty good job of rolling back the high end, especially if you activate the ""crunch"" button.The build quality seems to be pretty good, though I should note that while the pedal is the same size as other MXR pedals, it is significantly lighter.  I suppose this could make it more susceptible to denting and damage if it travels, but it should be plenty durable for 95% of users.  I really like the switch on this one too, it's easy to press and clearly clicks ""on"" once depressed.  One minor annoyance if you use the ""crunch"" setting is that the blue light (which is annoyingly bright like an LED headlight) stays on EVEN when the pedal itself is off.  This can be quite distracting if you rely on the lights on your pedal board to tell you which effects are on.  Not really a major gripe that detracts from the pedal's quality, but a frustrating design decision.Basically, if you get the right setup, you'll get great tone.  I got this pedal specifically to try and find a better alternative to the BOSS DS-1, which lacks mids and can sound harsh/abrasive.  The MXR '78 Badass is definitely superior in that regard, but a lot will depend on your rig and settings.  I find that this pedal really excels on playing single notes on the lower strings (think ""Walk this Way"" by Aerosmith, or ""Hangingaround"" intro by Counting Crows).  And if you pair it with a fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal, you could probably thicken it up a bit for higher solos.  Great pedal!"
376,257,4.0,"Not every tune needs tremolo I grant you, but when you need one, this will do the job and them some. Simple controls. The LED pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit's settings at all times. 100% silent switching. In a FX loop, there's not a trace of hiss, hum, or noise in any form. In a chain running into an amp's input, there is a slight volume increase. Not much, but a little. No big deal really, unless you're a real tone freak. There is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use. Being a true bypass, it changes nothing when off either. The box is ultra solid. The jacks are all metal. The switch is stout. In short, this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean, warm, tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit. It it anchored to my board! It is not going to come off because it's that good. Besides, how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it???"
454,257,3.0,"This is a very good piece of equipment for its price. Used mildly, it gives the sound a more natural feel."
1179,257,1.0,"It is built like a tank, but it quit working after a couple of weeks. I haven't made time trouble shoot it yet, so I'm not sure what component has failed."
447,257,3.0,"Pretty cool knock-off of the Schaller trem or Diaz Tremodillo. This is my 2nd or 3rd Joyo pedal, and my favorite thus far. I don't care for the cheap jacks, but you get what you pay for, and I can always replace them if they break (I work on pedals all the time).I've got a scratchbuilt improved EA Trem (with two footswitchable speeds) and a cheap little Danelectro Tuna Melt. Other than the crummy bypass and plastic construction, the Tuna Melt is my favorite since it has the hard/soft switch. The improved EA has a great preamp for guaranteed unity gain (or more), and the footswitchable speeds that I added gives it extra flexibility. But I think the Joyo trumps it by just a little bit in that the core trem sound is a nice blend of the Tuna Melt's hard and soft settings.So part of this is really a subjective take on this flavor of trem, but suffice it to say if you've tried a few, this one will probably satisfy you at least a bit. No unity gain issues, and the speed and depth have a good sweep throughout their ranges.And it's just a niggle, but how hard would it be to get the word &#34;tremolo&#34; silkscreened so that it's centered on the box? At least there's no skull and flames like on the High Gain Distortion."
29,257,3.0,"This pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from. From subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only $40! And it's built tough like a good effects pedal should be: full metal case and solid construction, an all around great buy"
245,257,4.0,"The joyo tremolo is awesome, best for the buck. It's just as good as any, I love the joyo pedals. affordable and doesn't break the bank"
1157,257,4.0,"For most guitarists, tremolo is a very simple effect.  You simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a ""shimmering"" effect.  It's used in subtle fashion in everything from to 50's/60's rock and surf guitar to modern ""indie"" rock.  But most guitarists (like me) were never going to shell out $100 (or more) for a Boss or other expensive tremolo option.  In fact, there really weren't that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market.Enter the Joyo JF-09 Tremolo.  This pedal is simple, durable, affordable ($40 - $45), and it just works.  The only two controls are for Intensity (depth of the volume swells) and Rate (how fast the swells cycle).  The LED light dims rhythmically along with the ""Rate"" control, which is a nice visual indicator.As for the sound - the pedal sounds great.  It doesn't color or diminish your tone in any way.  I'm not a ""tremolo expert"", but the effect sounds as it should.  If you're the type to obsess over tremolo, then you probably aren't looking to save money anyway, and there are $200 boutique options from Catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features.  I'm not particularly interested in those, so the lack of those on the Joyo won't detract from my score.Regarding the quality and durability of Joyo pedals, there's a lot of discussion about that, but also some misinformation.  I've personally owned 7 of them at one point or another (yes, I like them that much), and I've yet to have one fail.  The early run of Joyo pedals is actually quite durable, and includes the JF-09 Tremolo and every pedal numbered from JF-01 through JF-17.  The more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance, and while many of them still sound great, they feel lighter, ""cheaper"", and the switch is a little more suspect.  I recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the U.S., rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from China.  Many of the U.S. vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it, which is a huge advantage.Highly recommended!"
358,114,2.0,"This device works well, but sound is far from perfect. Distortion is more noticeable at higher volume. For the price paid is a very reasonable option."
1302,114,3.0,"not the greatest little pick up, for the price im more than happy with its performance.  put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems, run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny.  I wont fit in the sound hole to I clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well.  Cant beat it for the price."
1381,114,3.0,"I like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole, or, for that matter, to the headstock, where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole. It works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound, not quite true to your guitar (you will note this in particular with a classical guitar). This can be balanced, to some degree with your amp's equalizer and/or the treble and bass settings. However, compared to the AXL Pickup (which I bought for comparison), the Cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces. It is not bad, but it does not reach the quality of the AXL. Both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best. The Cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar."
373,114,0.0,"DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue.  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, ""it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.""  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description ""regardless the surrounding noises.""  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. Good Luck then!"
1398,114,4.0,I bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin .They had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback.Well surprise surprise surprise it didn't feedback and it sounds great.I would recommend this product.
1223,114,4.0,this was for a friend who liked the way the guitar pikup worked that he ordered 2 more for his family members.
1062,114,4.0,"I have a couple of clip on mics that I tried out.  This one is definitely the best.  I use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke.  You do have to find the sweet spot, but once you do, it works great through my Pignose amp, and actually fits right inside my Pignose.  Great value and price too!"
112,114,4.0,"After purchasing many kinds of attachments to amplify my mandolin or fiddle, with little or no satisfaction, I ordered this little mic.  I didnt' expect much considering the price.  It works so great, I ordered a few more.  Clip it into the guitar sound hole, or on the head stock, or on the mandolin head stock or on the fiddle....each time, it delivers a natural pleasant sound, not distorted or squeaky. The cord is long enough for me to stand and move around some while I play.  that is a GREAT bonus for me!!"
940,114,4.0,Very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it!!!!!! I would recommend this product to a friend!
408,114,4.0,"I really like the Cherub pickup. It is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup I've used. The sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups I have. The pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only 8 feet long, but for 8 bucks it can't be beat."
462,114,3.0,I just play at home with friends. It works well so far on all my ukuleles.  However every time you touch your instrument it's going to transmit that sound into your amp so it's nothing I'd be using on stage if I didn't have to.  Still it seems to be a good value but truth be told I haven't had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue. Time will tell.
1100,114,2.0,"It arrived on time, I have an Epiphone Hummingbird acoustic guitar, so I needed a pickup for do some recording,it works well but It's not very loud. This thing should sound louder, next time, I'll buy a Duncan pickup."
1255,114,4.0,"I recently purchased a Vox Mini3 G2 modeling amp to go with my new Mainland Tenor (acoustic/electric) ukulele. It was my first electric instrument and I immediately fell in love with the combination uke/amp.A little time went by and I began wishing I could plug my 5 other non-electric ukuleles and 3 guitars into my amp.  I see DIY pickup sets are pretty inexpensive, but I didn't really want the expense (times eight) or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments.Then I stumbled on this Cherub pickup.  For about the cost of lunch at McDonalds it seemed I might &#34;electrify&#34; on the fly whatever instrument I cared to . . . pickup.  So I bought it.Bottom line is that it works very well for my needs.  And although I don't have a very critical ear, I (think) I can hear a slight quality/clarity difference between the built-in pickup on my Mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments, but that's not a surprise and such a small difference that I don't much care. So far I've been clipping it into the sound holes, but I might try it on the headstock as others have recommended.If you're a Rock-God don't even consider this (why would you anyway?). But if you're a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while, this Cherub is for you."
1009,114,1.0,This is more of a toy than a good pickup. It functions but doesn't sound great. What did I want for this price anyway?
1366,114,4.0,"I put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the &#34;G&#34; string and it sounds great. What a buy for the price. You may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot. Whatever spot you find is best for you, it's worth it, I'm going to try it on my reso-uke next."
1245,114,4.0,"Well This work well with my Uke, and there is a review that pretty much sum it up! Put it on the headstock!"
103,114,4.0,"only  thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place, but  worked great for what I wanted to screw around with it,"
55,114,1.0,"First we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup.  It's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar.  As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole.  It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices.  Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4"" to 1/4"" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord).  You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. If you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above.  For what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay.  I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes.  I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from.  But this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to."
458,466,4.0,"I purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn't work. Whereas, this does the job. I'm happy I purchased this and didn't have to invest in purchasing 9V batteries every time I wanted to play guitar."
1396,466,3.0,"You know the problem with 9v wall warts is that noise in the signal can be a problem.  I am powering my 9 unit pedal board with this adapter and it works great.  I have used it some at lower voltages, but only on my older analog pedals.  I wouldn't reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage.  The cord is a little wimpy compared to my Boss PSA adapter, but it is acceptable."
451,466,4.0,"The Danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with (3V to 9V), by giving less power to them, you can get some really spooky sounds; great fun, but can also help give you your characteristic sound.  I also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet, this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it, like other adapters do.  The price is great, I'm planning to have several of this."
88,466,4.0,The first power source that is fun.  It can take the edge off of a distortion of OD pedal by rolling off the voltage.  I have yet to use it with a fuzz but I hear it sound sick.
1044,466,3.0,"I like the Dan Electrode but I noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect (turned my Heavy Metal into a sick fuzz and my LavaBox  into a primitive distortion), and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustain(Onerr Overdrive) or volume(FrenchToast) and thats it. It's still a good 9volt power supply but the voltage drop feature doesn't always 'wow' you."
286,100,4.0,"This may have been the best money I've ever spent for a guitar accessory. I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck. It has a smooth action, no ""kerchunk"" noise. My guitar stays in tune when capo-ed. I love it!"
742,100,4.0,"Good quality. Adjustable and does not get in the way, Great improvement over spring capos. Not much more to say but need five more words to post"
1243,100,4.0,"I've bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit. Well, the hunt is over. Amazing tone, perfect tuning. I'm completely amazed with this capo........"
681,100,3.0,I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck.I found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th. Both are very good. I did notice that if I had a wider neck (I think i am 42.5 mm at the nut on my two Takamines) the may be a bit short. They work and are cool looking. I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great. Cheaper ones also work
137,100,4.0,"Well made, proven over decades. Switched from NS capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck. Not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement. Requires less adjustment. Square pad allows placement right next to the fret. Easy to adjust with a bit of practice.I enjoy using quality machined parts, so this is a pleasure, plus it is built to last."
154,100,4.0,"So I heard these were good, and ordered one to try. I was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down.A must have."
70,100,4.0,"I've used Shubb for years.  I strayed briefly on a Fender Smart capo.  You can read my review on that item.  I really liked it at first and in my review I said I was converted from Shubb.  Im back to Shubb.  The Fender is plastic and it works fine on my electrics but not as well as on my acoustic.  The Shubb works great on both. If you just buy a Shubb to begin with, you wont ever have to waste money on trying out different capos.  It will not clamp on to your headstock, so if you like having a capo sticking out of your guitar when you're not using it, then this isn't it."
281,100,2.0,"I like this capo because you can adjust the pressure, but I've had it pop of easily twice already. Have others I trust more."
510,134,4.0,"Simple. Effective.  Just what I wanted.  Seems a tad flimsy, but, time will tell.  Tuning couldn't be easier.  Neat product."
1260,134,4.0,"Simple and easy to use, easy to carry around.Love it, the display is cool, and can't ask anything more."
799,134,2.0,It's not that great. You go through batteries like crazy and it doesn't work at all for bass. It's fine for guitar or banjo
170,134,3.0,i ordered a couple from my guitar seller...enjoyed..saw these and tried again...the box for tuner was a little smushed...but well packaged and arrived on time...will order again if needed..enjoy
32,134,4.0,"works great,great little tuner,i would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner. i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it, but im pretty impressed."
10,134,3.0,"This is a handy little piece, and for the money a great deal.  I have one of these for each of my guitars and they're as accurate as anything else I've used."
405,134,4.0,"Well, to date, these Snark tuners have got to be one of the best tuners I've ever run across.I highly recommend them, especially the ones with the built-in vibration sensor."
15,134,2.0,"I ordered this primarily for my 5 string Ovation Bass.  First, there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings.  My Ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but I was finally got it on the bottom between the D & G string tuners.  It does not respond well to an open B, but octaves are fine and as long as I have confidence in my intonation it is no problem.  I tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on.  When I tried it on my Ibanz solid body 5-string I found it to be even less likely to &#34;read&#34; quickly or at all. Also worked great on my 6 strings."
589,134,4.0,"I used this tuner as I transitioned from playing Rocksmith to playing in the real world. My amp had a built in tuner, but it seemed to give inconsistent readings. With this tuner, it doesn't matter if it is electric or acoustic, it gives a very very accurate reading. My luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it, they were only off by 2 units in any given direction. Very happy and pleased with this one."
981,134,4.0,i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend. and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy.. a must for guitarists!
458,134,4.0,Does what it was intended to do. Completely satisfied with this purchase. Seems to work just fine for my needs.
108,134,2.0,"The one that shipped was the cheaper, shiny plastic one.  In my experience this model is inferior.  Also the rubber lining inside the clip was unattached - probably the glue didn't hold?  I like Snarks and think they are some of the best clip-on tuners.  Just not a fan of the cheap, shiny plastic versions.  I'll try returning it and getting the SN-8."
628,134,4.0,"Got this to tune my guitar without relying on Rocksmith on my PS3, and to double check against it. I have a pretty crappy ear, so I rely on it to tune correctly. Responds fast, display is INCREDIBLE! I wish my car dash looked like this thing. Fits easily on the headstock of the guitar, in front or behind. Tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument, not using a microphone, so you can tune even if it is noisy. And any pedals, effects, amps, etc in the setup do not affect the tone, you are tuning the actual resonance of the string. Even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well. Forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too. For the price, I would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one."
1005,134,4.0,"I bought this because I bought a used Martin D15M that didn't have a tuner built in, and it clips right on the neck and is easy to turn on. The cool led readout instantly tells you which string, and gives you the ""green"" when the string is in tune. This is a great little tuner and I recommend it."
42,134,3.0,"The tuner I choose is very easy to use, simple and small. Good for people who don't have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument. I recomend it."
663,134,3.0,"Great tuner for the price.Makes tunning easy and fast.The grips come off the neck on my acoustic,but works better on my electric."
912,134,4.0,It is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music. I really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you.
342,134,4.0,"-  This tuner is affordable and it works well. I have purchased six so far. They are sturdy. They have all come with a battery in the box you have to install yourself.-  I actually sat on one and thought I broke it, turned out the main tuner head pops right back on to the goose neck. The LED is bright in low light but does not display well in bright daylight. If the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery. The fairly large disk style battery cost me $9.80 for a two/pack at  Walgreens.-  We had a Birthday Jam at a friends house. I used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists. At the end of the night I gave it to the birthday boy as he had admired it all night.-  I gave one to my grand-nephews. I keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars. They stay on in their cases. I like the goose neck style but I have not tried the other no-neck swivel ones. I also have one for my Bass. It's a great musician's party favor.-  I always had trouble reading my old analog tuners in low light so I really like these tuners. Don't forget - Practice, Practice, Practice."
841,134,4.0,"Snark tuners are great. Since I've bought Snark tuners, they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way. I've had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything. They are great and last forever. This one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine-tune your instrument. It have a vibration and mic sensor, so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played. Really nice piece of equipment for a small price."
1277,134,4.0,It's a pretty cool little gizmo. The clip on feature is really helpful too; makes me wonder what I did before I had one.
236,134,4.0,"I have several of these for my guitar, fiddle, and mandolin.  It works well for all of them and is inexpensive."
1282,134,4.0,"I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it's costs more than Amazon.I think the Amazon price is the best you'll find.It works as well as expensive tuners. In addition to tuning up the strings, I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation.Be advised though, that it only registers natural notes and sharps. It does not show a readout of flat notes, instead it shows the &#34;equivalent&#34; note. But as violin players know, a B flat is NOT the same as an A#.But it doesn't just read the letter of the note your on. The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it.For ten bucks, you can't go wrong."
243,134,3.0,"This will b my 2nd one of these so to me it's worth it. The 1st one I loaned to a friend and never got back so for $10 I just got another. I think their pretty accurate. I normally tune by ear but if there's a few of us playing then sometimes someone needs one, and I always use it putting on new strings myself. As far as battery life goes you can get them right on Amazon. They are cheap you can get a package of 6, each one lasting over a year or if you prefer you can go over to Walmart and get them in the jewelery section."
1180,134,3.0,"I'm pretty impressed with it.  I've only used plug-in types of tuners prior, and this was a nice surprise.  I ran this through my ukulele, electric guitars as well as an electric bass.  I was blown away how it could tune my bass.  It works quickly, and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Took one star off for visibility.  Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily."
1217,134,4.0,"My eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin. It seems to be accurate, and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself."
407,134,4.0,"I used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly.  I bought my dad one, too.  he loves it too!!!"
75,134,4.0,Works well even with a room full of noise....................plus it's easy to see. These are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a Guitar or Uke.
584,134,4.0,"I used this to tune a coconut thumb piano. If it can tune that, it should handle your guitar or bass FINE. Was really impressed to see it in action. NOT THE SMOOTHEST operation in the world but it's gig-bag small and accurate."
936,134,3.0,"Works great and does a good job, a must have type tool for the price get one !!! Light takes up little space and easy to use ."
899,134,4.0,Clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar. Pluck a string and it will indicate what it is. Turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done. Takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar. Mine is electric. Works plugged in or unplugged.
945,134,4.0,"Got this tuner for my new bass.  clipped it onto the headstock, was able to tune without plugging it into the amp. clear bright display.  Might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars"
196,134,3.0,"Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find. And they tune with amazing accuracy. If this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better, but there's already another model for that. In one way it's better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while you're tuning, so this tuner is a pretty good choice."
1088,134,3.0,"I LOVE snark tuners, this not being the first one I bought, nor the last. I loved the fact that I didn't have to press all the buttons like the other ones. Just get it relatively in tune by ear, then this thing will help you with the rest. My only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip. It has already pulled up and I only put it on and off my guitar maybe 3 times so far. I mean, I've had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad. I'm just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe."
214,134,3.0,"I have played guitar/bass for quite some time and have used numerous tuners ranging those those big Korg strobe tuners to my latest Sabine STX-1100. I liked the big Boss TU-1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations.I was at a big jam in a nightclub around Christmas and saw a bunch of guys using clamp on tuners of varying brands and thought I would try one. I looked at the Amazon offerings and after reading reviews settled on this one over the SN1 or SN2.This is too easy and my guitar has never stayed in tune like this before. It requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time. The only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't really like the E string of my bass. I don't think it picks up those long wavelengths so well. I will try the SN8 shortly and give this one to a friend.I do recommend this for guitarists because you will always be in tune no matter the tuning. If you leave it on while soloing you can see what notes you are playing. I am my own guitar tech, as well as for a friend, and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thing.Get a Snark and you will be happy.Edit - I don't like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to. The only place to clip is the very end and you are fighting tuning keys for space at that point. If you can get it there comfortably it works but nothing like with a Fender or Gibson; both which have plenty of space on the headstock."
870,134,3.0,"I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass. This handles bass tuning much better. The lit display is great for tuning on stage, and because it works on vibration you don't need to worry about muting when you are tuning.I also find it very accurate. I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks. This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer."
200,134,3.0,"I've had a few of these things, not all the same model. This one was hard to read. I changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit. Overall I like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal."
282,134,2.0,"This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly. Clamp it on, press the power switch, and then  pluck a string. It will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tune.I only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 1/2 charge out of the box. It still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery.  Shouldn't it have a full battery since it is brand new? Not enough of a hassle to send it back, but worth mentioning.Had the battery not been an issue, I would have rated this 5 stars."
186,134,4.0,"This is one of the best, simple to use, guitar tuners I've used -- and I've used a lot of them.  The bonus is that it's also one of the least expensive that I've seen.  You won't be disappointed."
1425,134,3.0,"Any guitarist knows how one of these works.  Clamp it on the head, turn it on, and tune.  I've tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass.  My only real complaint is that it often takes 3-4 seconds to register the note it's getting.  It occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well.  The low E on my bass will occasionally register as a B (3rd harmonic) for example.  In general, the dullest means of plucking the string (finger instead of pick) will give the quickest and most glitch-free pitch.  All in all, it's a handy little tool to have in the gig bag."
1046,134,3.0,"Not quite as loaded as the red All Instrument Snark, but it gets the job done. Is very sensitive to vibration."
303,134,4.0,"I've been using aKorg TM-40 Large Display Digital Tuner and Metronomefor a long time with my guitar. While adequate, I wanted the Snark because it was made specifically for guitar and the clip-on feature would counter my laziness in finding the tuner.The snark is great, and the price is amazing. The Snark, unlike the Korg, tunes by vibration.. so if it isn't attached the the guitar, it won't work. I feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient. With the Korg, the dial would spin all over the place and I would just mentally estimate where the right tone would be. The Snark is much more decisive and faster so it eliminates all the guesswork out of tuning. You will know exactly how sharp or flat the guitar is or if you want to try alternative tunings like drop-D it is so much simpler than with the Korg.No metronome but that's what I'm keeping the Korg for. I also wish that this specific came in another color other than black. There are Snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars.Overall, extremely happy with this purchase."
1153,134,4.0,"Awesome for $10. Accurate with TV on in the background. This thing is just sweet, I just love it. Easy no-brainer."
1286,134,4.0,"It's just about dead-on with my Korg, which is extremely accurate. I had never seen a tuner that you can just clip onto the neck like this, and it is hugely convenient to have it sitting right there as you play. It's soft enough with the clip, that it is safe to have on a high end guitar without worrying about it scratching or hurting anything. It shuts itself off when you forget to do that -- which happens a lot. Good little tuner at a steal of a price. I like it."
686,134,0.0,"I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...First the positives:- Looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment:- inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ..."
554,134,4.0,"I have several Snarks. This one is the most basic. All are fast and accurate. I have many young guitar students and the Snark is the first tuner they have no trouble using. I also have purchased several red, blue and the new Super Tight tuner. The Super Tight is slightly faster, brighter and more accurate, but the speed, brightness and accuracy of all Snarks are very, very good. I own many tuners, and clip ons of many other brands. The Snark is by far my favorite. There is no close second."
232,134,4.0,"I've been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners. This is by far the best I've ever had. Not only is it accurate and easy to use, but it's so convenient! Simply clip it to the head of the guitar, press the only button on the unit and start tuning. Also, unlike other tuners I've used, this tuner does a great job of filtering/ignoring ambient noise in the room. I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation, even with the TV on in the room!Pro's:- Vibrant , easy to read display- No need for cords, chargers even when used on electric guitars/bass.- Simple one button activation- Lightweight - I leave it on my classical guitar all the time, especially after restringing.- Auto Shutoff (also can manually shut it off, just press the one button a second time)- Works for Guitar and Bass (both acoustic and electric) and violin - Also works on my Ukulele!Con's:Wish I had this 20 years ago!Bottom Line:This is a no-brainer. The price, quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist."
1052,134,3.0,I really and suprisingly like this little gadget. It works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate.
894,134,4.0,"This is a very accurate tuner. I have used it on mandolins, guitars, violins and violas, and double bass. They are a little hard on batteries, but not overly so.Highly recommend!"
215,134,4.0,"I love my Snark SN5 tuner.  It works smoothly without any issues, and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately.  All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock, and it is ready to go.  The SN5 is smaller than I expected, but the multicolored meter is easily readable, and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position.Using the color coded meter, you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp, and adjust the string tension accordingly.  With a little practice, tuning becomes a quick and easy process.  The unit is powered by a CR 2032 battery, which generally has a long life.Although the clamp has rubber pads, apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage.  The instructions states that the Snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes, polyurethane, French polish, and nitrocellulose lacquer.  Those with Gibson, Gretch, or Taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning.  I have had no problems using this tuner on Kramer, Ibanez, Charvel, Epiphone, and ESP guitars.  The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins.  I do not have either of those instruments, but I imagine the tuner would work much the same.As there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock, it took me a little while to decide on the SN5.  Even after eliminating tuners by D'Addario and Planet Waves, selecting the SN5 wasn't that simple, as Snark makes a number of similar tuners.  I am completely satisfied with the SN5, and believe that it fully deserves a 5 star rating.  It is also the least expensive, of the tuners I was considering buying.  If the finish of your guitar isn't an issue, you may find the Snark to be very helpful."
1084,134,4.0,"The Snark SN-5 Tuner for Guitar, Bass and Violin gives me spot on tuning. I especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner. When playing music with other musicians who are also tuning or warming up I don't have to be concerned with hearing myself pluck the strings of my guitar or violin while comparing the sound to a pitch pipe or keyboard. This tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument.I decided to buy this tuner after another musician lent me his extra one during a jam session. I was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself ASAP!"
527,32,3.0,"works as it shoukd, better instructions could come with it with a larger size text. also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking."
906,32,4.0,"I've had two of these tuners, and they do a fine job as far as I can tell.  I lost one, and had to buy another one.  I also bought a much more expensive tuner, and I cannot see that it does a better job than this one.  I bought my first tuner like this one about 3 years ago, and the rubber pads kept falling off, but I have not had that problem with my new one."
1028,32,4.0,"I own several tuners, and two Snark-2 tuners, which are great (except they're not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner - Korg PC-1--please see my review of that tuner).So, since I needed another tuner for my ukulele, I ordered this time a Snark-6.  This one says, specifically, for a ukulele.  I wanted to try it compared to the Snark-2Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic TunerThe Snark-6 and Snark-2 are identical, except for color.  The Uke tuner here is gloss black, and the Snark-2 is matte red.  Otherwise, the size of the dial/face, the clip itself is precisely the same.  So, there's nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2.  The tuning is chromatic, so it's good for any specific instrument (mandolin, guitar, uke, banjo, etc.).So, choose whichever color you prefer, and go for it.  Sweet tuner.  Superb graphics on the dial, colorful accurate, and inexpensive (but not ""cheap"" build, like the Korg).  Highly recommended tuner."
1330,32,4.0,I love this tuner. I feel its more accurate that the old one I have that was given to me. I will always buy Snark tuners. They are very sensitive so I feel that my instrument is in truer tune.
1333,32,4.0,I have use this tuner for quite a few years . its easy to use-- clip it on and go.. I just bought 8 of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or Mandolin. The price was good see ya
126,32,4.0,"I use this for my uke, my 12 string acoustic, a parlor guitar, and my trusty Taylor. Easy to use, very accurate, highly recommended."
299,32,1.0,"There is almost no difference between this and the Snark SN-1, and by that I mean the design flaws. You have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading, and they eat batteries like crazy. The Snark SN-8 is far superior."
853,32,4.0,Extremely easy to use. tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly! Have used it several times and first battery still has juice.
1428,32,4.0,"This is accurate and can be used for many different purposes, It is durable and can be used while playing."
1056,32,4.0,Works like it's supposed to.  Although I should have just got the universal instrument tuner.  This one only tunes in the uke keys.
1074,32,4.0,"Been using the snark tuners for while now... Functions perfectly.. Only problem I have is it is small enough that I have trouble finding it sometime... So, I have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same..."
327,32,4.0,"Anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that I am not fond of the Snark displays.  I prefer the ""needle"" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the Snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  However, that's me and YMMV, as they say on the Internet.Don't ask, then, why I got a SN-6.  I don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and I like to play with accessories.I am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  They all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.Well, that's not *quite* true.  Some models suffer fits in certain situations.  The rapid fall of the old Intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low E string on a Martin dreadnought.  A web search will reveal countless workarounds.  I (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.Lately, I've become enamored of theKala KA-UBASSFS Solid Mahogany U-BASS - Fretted.  If you want a tuning challenge, the low bass E string is it.  The SN-6 hardly hiccups.  Other tuners seem to do ""okay"" but require a little coaxing.  Not the SN-6! That's 5 stars in my book!"
1058,32,3.0,"This little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off.  It works without it, but things things like that putt me nuts."
143,32,4.0,"The Snark is great. I have 2 for my 4 ukuleles (so I can always find one),and a 3rd for my guitar. It's not just a UKE tuner. LOVE THEM! And, gavemy grandson a shock-blue one to go with his American Flag painted uke."
1219,32,4.0,Works great and easy to use.  It also seems to be very accurate.  Definitely worth the money!! (Should also work for any stringed instrument)
934,32,4.0,"I'VE ALWAYS TUNED MY UKULELES BY EAR.  NO PROBLEM.  BUT I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SOPRANO UKULELE FOR MY GREAT NIECE AND KNEW I  COULDN'T ALWAYS BE THERE TO TUNE IT FOR HER.  I WAS LEARY ABOUT THE USE OF THE SNARK DESPITE READING MANY FAVORABLE REVIEWS PRAISING IT.  BUT I'M NOW A CONVINCED SNARK USER..  SO SIMPLE.  SO EASY TO USE.  SO ACCURATE.  SO LIGHT.  PLUCK A STRING AND TUNE IT TO THE DIAL, AND EUREKA .-  SUCCESS.  BUY ONE - YOU'LL LIKE IT."
410,32,4.0,"This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear. I use it on all my stringed instruments, (Haven't tried it on a base) This tuner is easy to attach and read, and the price is great, I have spent 60 bucks on tuners that do not function as well."
662,32,2.0,"I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar.The Snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable, cardboard box.  I have no problem with it, but the Hola! stores better.  I don't really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a &#34;ukulele&#34; setting.  It's a chromatic tuner.  It very well may be sized differently from their other models to fit better on ukuleles.  Other than that, I'm not quite sure what makes it specifically a &#34;Ukulele tuner&#34;."
1023,32,4.0,"If you have a ukulele you know (or may not know) that it needs constant tuning especially with new strings. This little gadget does the trick. I was pleased to see that it is a no brainer to use and since it clips to the head it is there when you need it between songs.You will not go wrong with this purchase and I am sure you will love it better than trying the &#34;my dog has fleas&#34; tuning method.Oh yea, it does not just limit you to the basic notes for the uke but will tell you sharp and flat notes too!Now put that order in!"
229,32,4.0,"These are great little tuners!  You can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly, which is especially helpful when you're breaking in strings or any time.  I've played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent, and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming.SO, these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts."
881,32,4.0,It's easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician. Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly.
445,32,2.0,"I personally own two of these Snarks and I've seen several others among my friends.  They're great, easy-to-read and easy-to-use tuners that are surprisingly cheap.However, half of the Snarks I've come into contact with have broken within a few weeks.  One of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage.  The screen is SUPER faint.  It's still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting.  This also happened to two of my friend's Snarks.My other Snark is still going strong.  I'd still recommend them for non-critical applications just for the price and ease of use.  However, these definitely aren't reliable gig-worthy tuners.  They're just so cheap it's easy to buy multiple Snarks and cover all of your guitars."
537,32,4.0,This little gem is worth it's weight in gold!  So easy to tune with it.  We have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong.  Automatic  shut-off helps too.
1212,409,4.0,I use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and IT WORKS PERFECTLY!!! Very minimal buzz... LLLOVE IT!!!
520,409,4.0,"If you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam.  I recently purchased, and then returned, the iRiffport.  I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement.  Here are the reasons why:1) The connector on the iRiffport (the one that goes into the iPad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time.  I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way.  With the Apogee Jam, the connector is just like the iPad's connector, except it ALSO has the ""prongs"" that come out of it, securing the connector into the iPad.  To remove the connector from the iPad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the ""prongs"" go in so it can be removed...very, very secure.  I use the ""Gumdrop"" case on my iPad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used.  This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used.  IMPORTANT:  if you have such an iPad case, like me, I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport.  In fact, the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large, that I felt that it did not fit well through my case.  On the other hand, the Jam's connector is the same small size as the iPad's original connector.  This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad.2) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport:  you can hear sound directly from the iPad.  With the iRiffport, you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers.  I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward.  Nonetheless, with the Jam, I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so.  I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers.  With the Jam, I have this.3) The Jam has a gain meter (i.e., an LED) and a gain control.  The iRiffport does not.  When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application (green light).  There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport.4) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam.  If the cord breaks, I simply replace the cord, not my iPad connection device.  The iRiffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my ""normal"" guitar cable I used with the Jam.5)  Although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple (look at their website and their Garageband video).  And, since I have Garageband on my iPad, I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with Garageband.So far, I'm very pleased with the Jam."

This is now a boat anchor.  To buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax.  The extortion here is almost Monster cable like.  These folks should be embarassed."
186,409,1.0,"This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer, but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug.  It doesn't snap in place.  Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out.  That makes it fairly useless.  I may have simply gotten a defective one."
1157,409,4.0,"I really can't say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM.  Not even 3 years ago, I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a &#34;novelty&#34;, and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as &#34;gimmicks&#34; or &#34;toys&#34;.  Now, as of 2013/14, we have so many quality modeling programs, recording DAW's, and AudioBus to connect them to one another.  Whether you're a budding professional, or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers, the Apogee JAM (usually around $99.99) deserves a serious look.PROS -Extremely easy to use and widely compatible --&#62; No batteries required.  You get a small plastic converter with an 1/4&#34; input (for guitar cable) on one end and a digital output for 30-pin connector, Lightning, or Mac cables, all of which are included.  Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS (GarageBand, Agile AmpKit, AmpliTube, JamUp XT) will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the box.Crystal clear digital sound --&#62; The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input.  You'll hear your guitar as it's meant to be heard, and with far less hissing and junk in the background.Considerably less feedback --&#62; This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade.  My Positive Grid JamUp Plug wasn't disappointing me in sound quality, but there was so much additional noise that went with it, it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit+ to feed back.  High gain settings (even something basic like a Marshall JCM900) were practically unusable.  Even with clean settings, I had the noise filter turned WAY up, and that still didn't thwart the feedback issues.  The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly.  When I first plugged it in, I wasn't even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background.  What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface.  The JAM's improvement in avoiding feedback, alone, made it worth its price.No &#34;crosstalk&#34; - When you do multi-track recording with a headphone jack splitter, you get a bleed-over effect referred to as cross-talk.  Basically, you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track, but due to poor circuitry, this also gets fed back into the &#34;armed&#34; track you are recording.  Some people are bothered by this more than others, but it makes quality multi-track recording quite challenging.  I haven't noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever, since it is a digital connection.  (You can still monitor your playing using the iPad's headphone jack separately, obviously).Gain control and LED gauge --&#62; Not a feature unique to the JAM, but I love how it's implemented.  When you first plug in the device, the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up, but not being utilized by software.  Once the input is active in software, the light becomes green.  However, as you play and hit harder notes, the light may change to yellow/orange, or even red.  If it is getting into the red, your input level is too high, and may overdrive the signal.  You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial.  I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts.  Works well.CONS -Price point is a little high --&#62; Admittedly, I wasn't thrilled about having to spend $99.99 for what I was already doing with a $20 headphone jack.  That being said, I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best.  If I knew it would be as good as it is, the price would have been of little concern.  Also, there aren't really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaper.Lightweight plastic design --&#62; I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM, or that it is made out of plastic.  At the same time, the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table.  I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor.  But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it, and it's a problem you can address with common sense.Highly recommend the Apogee JAM.  It's a mid-level priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals."

My iPhone 4S, which I have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine...unless trying to use the JAM.In The Box: Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.It comes with the JAM and two cables (USB and IOS). It is bigger than I had imaginedIt's almost the length of an iPhone. Feels nice, and is very light. The cords aren't very long."
1093,391,4.0,"Wow, does this stick or what! I installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this &#34;Power Grip mounting tape&#34; on the top and bottom of the pedal (HOF reverb) and one afternoon I stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn't budge! Had I known this before I would have installed all my pedals with this Power-Grip wonder! Need sticking power? This tape will definitely fill the requirement."
34,391,4.0,"Love this stuff. Think I ordered it twice. Much better than standard industrial strength velcro. Just works, so what else more can I say?"
533,391,2.0,"Although it does exactly what it says...it will hold your items together (pedals to pedalboard)...it is significantly thicker than I expected which makes it difficult to use properly without covering the entire board. I purchased one strip and I will use it on my backup board, but I don't plan to purchase any more."
680,391,4.0,"This Power-Grip Pedalboard Mounting Tape is VELCRO ON STEROIDS!!!  This product makes your pedals SUPER SECURE.  The tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping &#34;teeth&#34; would make The &#34;JAWS&#34; shark envious.Word of advice;  Make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board. Once down you can pretty much count on an ALMOST PERMENT MOUNTING.And a hint;  Some pedals (like Behringer) have a rubber bottom. Remove these rubber &#34;non-skid&#34; plates because they come off too easily.Also; AMAZON sells &#34;couplers&#34;.  These take less room  and cut down on the clutter.As a matter of fact, AMAZON sells EVERY THING YOU NEED to put together a Pro Board."
71,391,4.0,"I love this tape for multiple reasons, one because when it's on, it's on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not, but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around, you can take it off. It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off. I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff! Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals, as it hooks to itself so you'll go through it pretty quickly."
1018,391,4.0,What a fantastic product! I believe I have been wishing for this for years!Only one problem. Make sure that you want that pedal there - because once it sticks - you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot.No longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel - they actually stay attached to the pedal board!I have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards - this stuff works and is T-U-F-F!I you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need!I just wish I could get paid for endorsing this product!*********************************Still holding strong - building another board and using this stuff - it's much better than regular velcro - I don't have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit - use this and that annoying issue goes away.
1403,391,4.0,"I've been using a standard size Pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the Velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit. I use it to keep 3 pedals in place: a Line 6 M5, a Seymour Duncan Twin Tube Classic, and a Live Wire A/B Switch. The first two are pretty heavy and bulky. I needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case, being carried vertically, with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of them.I decided to try out the Power-Grip and have been extremely impressed. First, I stripped the old Velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly. It all came off pretty easily. I then applied one strip of Power-Grip to each of the bottom 2 panels on the Pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals. I then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended.After attaching the pedals, I was amazed at how well everything was secured. The pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel, the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metal-on-metal abrasion. However, you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhere.I also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around (with some effort) and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bit.The grip also bonds to itself, unlike Velcro where you're keeping track of male and female tape when replacing it.I would recommend following the manufacturer's instructions and applying this stuff to clean, hard, non-porous surfaces. I've heard that the adhesive doesn't work on rubber, wood, etc. Many pedals have rubber padding / feet on the bottom but I've had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape on.You will appreciate the stability, security, and convenience this stuff provides. Get a few rolls as a meter doesn't go as far as you'd think."
449,26,3.0,I have never played a string instrument... and it looks like I'll be able to get the hang of this very quickly. Only problem is the strings. Sting one ... play's &#34;dead&#34; meaning it will not stay in-tune. Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem. Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon.
18,26,4.0,"This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called ""Easy Ukelele"" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.My Review:1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the ""Easy Ukelele"" app I mentioned above.2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says ""Gangia Brand"" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.Overall. This is a great price for the package."
1029,26,2.0,well I found the lesson very good and worth the money I payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great
1187,26,3.0,"This is such a cute little instrument, my daughter loves it and the sound is good.  The only downside is that it doesn't stay tuned for very long.  We always have to go and re-tune it, which can be frustrating.  But otherwise it seems well made, it looks great and when its tunes, the sound is good.  Its not multi-hundred dollar instrument, but for kids and beginners its a good deal."

728,14,1.0,"I tried this in front, in the middle, and at the end of an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier.  Whenever it is in the path, as soon as I engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably.  It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not.  The chorus effect is good, but I don't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop.  I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use, so I can't raise the send any more."
426,14,4.0,This is a great effect! Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products have always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This Analog Chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should. It's great to add low and high end cut to make it even more versatile. It is also very small and will not take a lot of space in your board. I actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations. You will not be dissappointed at all. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
204,14,3.0,"This pedal has a great range of function (with variable width and depth) along with an independent level control, and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs. It also has a dry through output.It can go from low depth high speed shimmers, to high depth, low speed oscillations, to ridiculous warble.The pedal is light weight, very high quality, durable, quite good looking, and all around a good pedal to play around with.Cons: The blue led, like many blue leds, is VERY bright; I usually cover them up with a sticker so I can see the setting on the pedal.It can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in (this can frighteningly spark). So make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall."
704,14,4.0,"I had sworn off Chorus pedals years ago, the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same. Not with the MXR Analog Chorus, very musical and transparent, I like the presets recommended in the instruction manual. the stereo out is very cool for using two amps . and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last forever. By the way this is the exact same pedal as the Zak Wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job , not all of us are metal heads"
374,14,4.0,"To start off with the unit is all metal construction and built like a tank, it is very easy to set up and use the controls are self-explanatory.You can get a wide variety of coarse effects from this unit from the very subtle to the crazy overdriven David Gilmour sound.One distinct feature this pedal has that sets it apart from the rest is you can actually use base and trouble cut off controls to tailor the sound to make it sound less tinny  and more full.Overall for the money this is a fantastic value well-built and has outstanding sound get it you won't be disappointed!"
83,14,4.0,I had used some Boss CE-5 and CH-1 and substituted them with this unit. It's has a cool analog/vintage sound of chours.
293,175,4.0,"This cable is an amazing find. It simply works! I am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them, but the cable I received is perfect.I plugged the cable into my Windows laptop, waited 30 seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers, and I was good to go. I plugged in a dynamic microphone, opened the Audacity software program, hit record and it was amazing sound quality. I had previously used a variety of input devices from a JamHub to a Behringer USB line input device to an Art audio preamp to even going low-budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the (ThinkPad) laptop. This cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device I have used.There are, however, a few limitations...- This cable is mono only, i.e. not for stereo recording. This seems obvious, but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff.- This cable only works with Dynamic Microphones. If your microphone is a Condenser microphone, you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of 'phantom' power source to power the condenser microphone.The really good things?- This cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the Audacity software. Some input devices are either very hot (too much level) or have hardly any gain at all, so this cable works very well by providing just the right level.- This cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, keyboard, etc. I have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them. I was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever (think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record) using just this cable and a Hosa www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WS1Q4E/ direct box I purchased from Amazon as well."

1043,175,4.0,"Very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone (or instrument using a direct box) to the USB input of a computer. I plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my PC. Win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes. I then recorded some vocals using Audacity, a free open source download. Recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all. Recording level was great, not sure why some reviewers said it was too low. Note that this will not provide phantom power, nor does the item description imply that it will. USB only provides 5VDC and phantom power usually requires 18-48VDC. Unless there is some kind of power converter (which would be much too large to fit in this compact package) it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires. Use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy!"
457,175,1.0,"This cable was very affordable, but you get what you pay for. It sounded brilliant while it wasn't broken, for about the 4 hours of runtime. It works if it isn't abused at all, but if you abuse it in any way at all, your out an XLR cable. I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage."

1402,764,4.0,"Having purchased many &#34;A&#34; frame and more &#34;traditional&#34; style stands, this one has quickly become my favorite. Not only is the padding much better than the rest of them, this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work. Only thing lacking a bit is the instructions, but it's easy enough to put together that they aren't really needed. I'll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon."
840,764,1.0,Well... its a stand..  its super cheap and i don't mean the price.  the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back.  its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well.  Instructions were ok..  came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon.  the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand..  there are better options out there for something portable.  this stand is worth 10.00 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money.
257,764,4.0,I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand. It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use. Assembly was pretty easy and took little time.
611,764,4.0,"I love this thing and for the price you just can't beat it. It seems sturdy and I have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up. I haven't tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my 7 electric guitars very nicely. Set up only took about 10 min or so and it included all the tools necessary. I saw the same one in guitar center a week later for $60 more. Like I said, for the price you can't beat it."
60,764,2.0,"This might be a really, really nice stand, but the one I received was defective-one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won't attach, so I have to return it for a refund.  I'll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it's intact this time."
1178,764,2.0,"It works as advertised but be aware it's not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish. It will mess up the finish. Nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my Gibson Les Paul for example. It's amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish, that's a pretty major design flaw. But they just keep making them.Anyway, it is a nice little stand but be careful. If you have a nice guitar you'll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage."
1096,764,4.0,After having collected a few guiters through the years I needed the kind of stand to hold certain ones in particular.
1192,764,4.0,Works well
270,764,3.0,"First of all, this is a $40 7-guitar stand. It's not a high-end $200 pro stand. That being said, the materials are decent. It seems strong and stable. I would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig. I bought it to have a convenient place to keep our 5 guitars and basses handy. Rather than having 5 individual stands, this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neat.The metal is decent, but if you tighten the screws too much, the metal does flex/warp.So far so good."
1295,764,3.0,it is not that large and really organizes my instruments.  The only detriment is that I leave my instruments out and they tend to collect dust.  Cover them with a sheet or something.
444,764,1.0,This stand is ok for light home use. I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel. Very cheaply made but does the job. Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on  the rack. Avoid if you can spend more.

885,216,4.0,"Don't Fret Position Indicator for 4/4 Violin or 14&#34; Viola is very helpful tool, especially for beginners. If you start to learn violin - buy it, it will make your study much prettier."
1250,216,3.0,"This item was purchased because I'm doing self-teaching on the fiddle.  I figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while I'm learning.  Since I'm used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go.  I like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions.  I also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you want.It did take some measuring to get this in place.  I had to be very careful to put it on squarely.  The closer I got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line, but not so much that it would affect how to use the template.One things I had to deal with was to make sure I had a MM measuring devise.  The bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut.  It took some doing, but I was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes."
43,216,3.0,"Good for any beginner, but consultation with a teacher, if you have one, is recommended.  For ham fisted persons, positioning is not easy; for lossening strings, proper bridge resetting, and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required.  Measuring requires a hard ruler with a full 330 milimeters (325 required) - bet you don't have one - or a technician's measuring tape and confident measuring skill.  Measuring is best with a cooperative assistant.  Bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the D string to hold the bridge position, measurement check, tightening the A string, measurement check, removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the 1st and 4th strings and tuning the instrument. Do it!  You'll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing.  If you ain't intelligent, Good Luck!  You'd best be served with dot stickers."
472,541,4.0,"These picks are comparable in shape and feel to Grisman's Dawg Picks (and frankly, cheaper). The thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and, depending on how you play, this may or may not be acceptable.In my opinion, if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist, without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge, you'll get a woody, warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume. Varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end. I play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks. (For guitar I prefer a 1 mm traditional tri-corner shape but that's a different review). If, however, you're really a fan of a biting high treble sound, these picks are probably not your best choice unless you're willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper. In fact, a pack of 12 three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you're searching for your ideal tone.If you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin, chances are your attack, tone and volume are generally softer and I think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone. Tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you're not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it's just slowing you down. For such a lighter stroke, I'd recommend the 1 mm tri-corner I use for guitar."
952,541,4.0,"This pick is well designed for mandolin playing.  Unlike standard guitar picks, it has generously radiused corners.  It's also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing."
404,541,3.0,"I was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my Fender beginner's mandolin set, worried I'd permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them. Having a dozen similar--a few for me and a few to share--meets the need! He heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice, especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks."
1252,541,4.0,"Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while.  I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge, which gives a warm round sound, but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound, all you need to do is file down one edge to what you'd like and you can have it all.  Great pick, I recommend it."
596,541,4.0,"This works amazing! It is very thick, which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin. It also works great for a guitar. It works really nice with steel strings, but I have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings."
931,541,2.0,"This is a good pick.  They give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely.  However they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot.  After trying a few others I settled on Wegen Picks.  They make the Golden Gates sound bleak in comparison.  Wegens definitely click less, are easier to grip and bring out the natural woody sound and character of the instrument.  If you are looking for something that will progress with you, you may wish to look elsewhere."
527,585,3.0,"I chose this rating because even though it is an Epiphone, a Les Paul and affiliation with Gibson it is made in China NOT the USA as one would think by the name affiliations.  I think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is NOT a USA product. When opened, the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but I did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case. The white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory. So someone messed up in QUALITY CONTROL. With that said, I find the finished look is fine without the guard, the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified. I decided NOT to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it."
906,585,3.0,"The ukulele is very cool looking, it plays nice, it doesn't sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele, it comes with cheap strings, but it's a very fun ukulele.  I think it's worth a hundred dollars."
984,585,1.0,"I really like Epiphone products. They are well-made, easy to play guitars. I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back. But, I received this Uke defective. I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all. Totally dead. There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon. If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me. I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon. I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem.  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically.  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture. If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5."
802,585,4.0,"I love this uke! it came fast. such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy!sounds amazing, intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune. it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing! the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever, owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it!"
881,585,4.0,"Beautifully finished. Everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable. Nice sound in the acoustic too. If this is an indicator of Indonesian made instruments, then all string instruments should be made there. Epiphone has outdone itself. I absolutely adore this instrument. I would love to have a Baritone Uku of this same design."
1235,585,3.0,"Dunno how, but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasn't installed.  The pickguard is no biggie, I actually didn't want it on there (it seems oversized to me).  If I wanted it on there tho, it's got a peel off sticky back.  Not having a cable was kinda a big deal.  I sent an email to Epiphone (Gibson), got a response within a day and after sending in proof of purchase, they promised to send me a cable.  Nice customer service.As far as the Uke, the finish on mine was perfect, no blemishes I can see.  I did change out the strings, and it does sound a 'little' better I suppose, but not that much.  Probably would have messed around on the stock strings a bit longer, but I listened to the reviews and did a change right away.  For $100, if you want a uke, this one looks awesome and plays well."
166,791,4.0,great picks. i like the feel and the control it provides. i like its texture and the size. just perfect.
741,791,4.0,"I don't know how much you can say about picks, but this is a versatile pack. You get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness. If you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks, this is for you."
1411,791,4.0,Need a little variety in your life? well... Its nice never having to look for a pick they're just always around now
1299,791,4.0,Simply a nice assortment of picks to try.  Worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make.
912,791,3.0,They are picks for guitars and they work. They also have pretty colors. Right now I am just writing to get the required words out. If you dont want anything heavy this is good for you.
24,791,3.0,"I only use a few of them, it's good to find what style fits you. I'd recommend it for finding what suits you."
689,791,4.0,"lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best, great picks sampler"
198,791,3.0,"Not cheap as far as pics are concerned, but it's definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then.  If you're new, it helps you find what you like.  if you're experience, you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound."
414,791,2.0,"i use thin picks, (.38, .46 and .50)  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i don't use.  i actually like the dunlop brand/material so once i get used to thicker ones, i'll try these.  the pack only have .50 and thicker in case you're looking for very thin ones.  if so, then don't buy this sample pack.  go and buy the Dunlop Nylon .38 or .46"
160,57,3.0,"This is a pretty decent guitar. If you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board. Was disappointed that the electronics are a tuner that you have to switch from string to string (why would they put a tuner in this six string guitar, that is made for a seven string?)  and a volume nob that goes from low to high. No tone control, no presence control. Hint: Don't go to guitar shops and play a better guitar than you can afford. It will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking."
1376,57,4.0,"I purchased this as my first classical guitar because I need a guitar I can plug in, overall I'm extremely impressed with it, it stays in tune pretty well, has shockingly low action for a classical, sounds great plugged in and unplugged, has a built in tuner, comfortable to play, overall I love the guitar, well worth the money!"
940,57,4.0,This is a great guitar for the money!!!! It has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments! The built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound. I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it!!!!!
196,57,3.0,"This guitar is pretty good for the price. The only reason it has 4 stars is because my first and 2nd string keep detuning. Might be the weather, but strangely it keeps tune in DADGAD. I think I may need to tighten some screws. Anyway, not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical."
839,57,4.0,"My C5CE Washburn has been a very good purchase. I was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords. I prefer guitars having solid woods, not laminated like this one. It has the ability to plug into an amp, has easy access to the battery, has a built in easy to use tuner, and the wiring dose not rattle about. It has a good compensated saddle, the frets are level and do not buzz, has a truss rod in the neck, and has a bound rosewood fingerboard. I have always liked the sound of classic guitars, like the option to plug in, and am more impressed by sound than brand name.A person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck. This is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar. It rings out very well, so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in.Mine has some edges not well stained, likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly. Top is a bit wavy, from buffing. Still has some orange peel but not a lot.  Lastly, the nut and saddle are too high for my preference. Some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top, sort of a classic color that I have gotten used to now.Other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs, this model is not. I was not clear enough above where I mentioned laminated woods.If something happened to it, I would be likely to replace it with another one just like it. A very cost effective, good sounding, well made guitar. Good job Washburn."
351,57,3.0,"This is an amazing guitar for the price. I wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection. The guitar has good tone and action. The built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently.  The guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in.  The pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud.  The guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified, but I prefer the acoustic sound.  The finish is a bit more orange than pictured. You could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one."
761,656,4.0,I bought these for my teen son who plays the bass. He absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well. Nice sounds.
567,656,4.0,I love these picks. I bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy. It is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely.
126,656,4.0,"I don't often use a pick for my soprano uke. The Mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that I really like, especially if I'm looking for a brighter sound."
853,656,3.0,these picks are bigger than i expected. easy to hold and very soft. they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks.
893,656,2.0,We purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the Ukulele.  They seem to make a damper sound rather than allowing the strings to make music.  Not sure I would buy these again. But great to give the kids when I don't want to hear 6 Uke's practicing at the same time.
229,656,4.0,"As a classical guitarist, I have never touched a pick to my nylon strings.  As a recent ukulele enthusiast, however, I have a little different approach.  In a group, if all are acoustic, a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers.  I tried these.  Nothing against them.  They are good for strumming.  For lead, I needed to use something harder.  I went to a soft plastic or nylon pick.  It will still not be too good for the strings, but it does the sonic job I need.For a nice strum, these are fine."
1143,656,4.0,"Recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun.. these, rubber picks, metal picks, etc. I play guitar.I'm not crazy about these for that purpose, but they aren't made for guitar obviously, so I can't fault them. They seem to be made well made. They are larger than I expected, and rather thick.Obviously these are made for ukes, so my review is probably not helpful to many. If you're like me and were looking for some variety for the guitar I'd suggest the rubber picks instead. They give a similar mellow sound without mudding up the tone, and they are easier and more comfortable to use also. Heck, maybe uke players should try those too?"
1176,656,4.0,"Aloha friends! Simply put, if you have a ukulele, then these are the picks that you should be using. Cheers!"
337,805,4.0,nice comfortable very comfortable to use and easy to install on the guitar and was just like the picture showed.
586,805,4.0,"2&#34; wide, Nylon strap is well made, comfortable and should last many years. The ends are leather, sewn onto the strap. It has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone, short or tall. Comes in several colors."
687,805,0.0,"I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but I don't know why. Maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. It wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd. It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. Unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort."
288,805,3.0,"I bought three of these at the same time to replace some older straps that were starting to rip and fall apart. They are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons. Two out of the three I bought are still performing well but one of them quickly cracked around the hole where that the strap button goes through and will occasionally slip off. Not a huge deal because that seems to happen with almost every guitar strap I've ever bought a one point or another but it happened quicker with this particular strap. I suppose, unless I have strap locks, there is no way around this."
27,734,3.0,"This was something I HAD to pick up, simply due to the price.  I own a Shure SM57 and compared to this, the sound is very close, not dead on, but I'd consider this over other mics for someone on a budget.The  top does not spin like the Shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost I'm sure, but none the less, it makes no difference sound wise.Overall, a great buy!"
1267,734,4.0,"I've used this mic with my Tascam US-800 Audio Interface, and PC, to record a high school chorus concert, and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone. I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone, and one as a piano/instrument microphone, and have gotten great results from both. The reproduction of the sound was very good. The mic seems very solid in build, and able to possibly take a little abuse, which is good with a travelling recording system, but I definately wouldn't TRY dropping one, even though they're a nice metal case, and metal grill. I'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals, and instrumentals, on a budget. I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps, but that's my next step, as well as drums."
1137,734,0.0,"I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy"
1214,734,4.0,"This is a great microphone for 10 bucks, (did I just say $10?....LOL) it does not have the same sound as a Shure SM 57, but it is kind of close. I used it as an overhead microphone on drums, recorded an acoustic guitar with it, and it worked perfect. Seen some reviews about &#34;hiss&#34; from this microphone, the &#34;hiss&#34; is from the cheap XLR into 3/4 connection (who uses that kind of connection anyway?, would have been great if it included a real XLR but cannot complain) after I swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it, hiss was gone, a no brainer really. I have been a producer/engineer for over 3o years, this is a great utility microphone, if you need an overhead, or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp, slap it on percussion etc... it will work just fine, the sound, it is quite clean actually, for $10 it is a steal. If this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio, as I can never have enough microphones. Every microphone has it uses. I would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality, well constructed pro like product."
832,734,4.0,"OK, I just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago. I did a little comparison to a pretty old SM57 that I've have since 1990ish and it was actually very good. The Pyle has more gain then the old 57 and as for sound I would say they are damn near identical to my ear. I did the A/B test by mic'ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic's in the very same positions. I would recommend for sure. Here's a link to an A/B comparison I did with an SM57. [...]"
1159,734,4.0,"This mic is good considering the price. Does it sound exactly like a 57? No. Do it have a decent quality sound? Absolutely. If you're expecting an SM57, then buy an SM57. If you want something close, on. A budget, this is your mic. Great value and good sound."
1398,113,4.0,they do the job great not a bad price for as many as you getgoing to buy some more for sure
315,113,4.0,I use to protect my microphones ...... of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone .... very good product I recommend
915,113,4.0,They're round and they fit over microphones.  Work well to stop pops and lisps.  Have been very happy with them.
563,113,3.0,"These foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do, and they do it just about average as you expect. My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis-shaped upon delivery. If your mike has a big enough ball, the ball will reshape the foam. Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth, round look to it."
1139,113,2.0,Nothing Fancy. Snug Fit for my Mic. Kinda of thin compared to others that I have seen. Bought extras in case others wanted to use my Mic.
1144,113,3.0,So I have these old EV mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled.  These provided an easy inexpensive solution.  No complaints.
705,863,4.0,Work awesome :)
731,863,4.0,I have a few guitars and these hooks work extremely well without costing too much.I also like the clean almost modern lines and that they don'y look like hardware.Plus they are all padded afor protection.
412,863,4.0,"I wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin, and this works great.  The arms are adjustable, so the instrument won't rest on the pegs.  The foam is good, and the hardware is included.  Plus, the price is great."
449,863,3.0,I am worried that I will damage my instruments if they are left standing around. This will allow me to show off and protect them.
988,863,4.0,"It's easy to install, very tough, and I love how it looks. It can support quite a bit of weight (assuming you properly installed it on a stud, and not in drywall) and helps with cable management on a rough day."
102,863,3.0,"I own a number of guitar hangers. This one was a good buy for the money. I have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive, but also a good deal pricier. For what I spent for this one, it is adequate as long as it &#34;holds Up&#34; (Pun intended)"
586,863,4.0,"Installs with two screws. I don't trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws. I drilled into wooden studs. It is firm, secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla. These seem very well made. The prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument. Some of the foam padding used in hangers and stands may cause a reaction with nitro cellulose finishes, so I will keep my eye on it for a while. Over all, it is a good way to display your instruments, it allows easy access and unclutters the floor in my very small music room. I bought 4 and going back for more."
1137,863,4.0,"I was excited with how easy it was to set up, and it makes my music room look so much better with guitars hanging up instead of just sitting on the floor or on stands"
300,863,2.0,"I've got three of these to hold an acoustic, a mini strat, and a jazzmaster .... while I had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former I was somewhat leary about the later (it's quite a bit heavier than the other two) but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart I have been trusting it ...Do Not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full-size electric (and I have my doubts about those plugs), the hanger will hold but the drywall might not, get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument. I used a different setup, #10 philips (slotted round heads would have actually been better) to fix them to a nice piece of 3/4 x 6 x 6 pine and screwed that into the studs with some 2.5"" #12 screws. Needless to say it's not going anywhere. As a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall.OK, one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a Jazzmaster."
112,863,3.0,"Arrived promptly.  Nicely packaged.  Holding my instruments securely.  I'll likely order more, and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts."
949,863,4.0,"many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use & install hangars. They are reliable (so far), they do not hurt anything on your instrument, & I am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars & violin! How self adjusting can they be!? apparntly - quite!"
283,863,4.0,"Easy install and great price. Shopped these for awhile and had to get all my guitars off the floor, bed, corners of room etc Installed in two minutes. Holds neck lightly - easy up easy down. Padded so does not scratch finish on neck. Will buy again."
26,863,4.0,"I use this item for my daughter 1/2 size guitar, its looks light in weight and firm, and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars."
366,863,4.0,You have to pay a lot more at a guitar store for something like this.  Granted it doesn't look as nice but it does its job.  I put couple of them up and have my guitar hanging  on it without any problem.
987,863,4.0,"I just got them (I bought 5) and put them up, so I don't know about longevity. So far, though, they work great and seem to be sturdy enough. And the price is great!I am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar, classical acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass guitar (4 string), and mandolin. The hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability."
702,863,2.0,"What makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently. If you have a standard size guitar neck, don't bother with that. I would have preferred something that was stationary that I could just stick the guitar in. As it is I have to jiggle and align it a bit, using 2 hands sometimes, which will be annoying after awhile. If I buy another it would be a standard hanger."
776,863,4.0,"Yes, I bought 3 and they fit all my guitars, mandolins, ukulele, bass.Very easy to install on the wall."
1173,863,4.0,"I just got done installing these. My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore, my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time, and my guitars won't tip over either. Not only was this the least expensive solution out there, but also the most space efficient (to keep my wife happy).I used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud. You can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers didn't get covered with drywall mud. Once you've found one screw, then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart. With the mounts screwed into wood studs, I don't see any way these are coming down. The mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic, to my heavy electric Strat, to my mandolin beautifully.Gotta love Amazon. With so many options to choose from, you can come up with something great and inexpensive too. And the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the product.BTW, this seller really got these to me fast. This was a great buying experience. Thanks DisplayGiftSCOM."
724,863,2.0,"This is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place.  the mount screws were too low of quality to use though, I went and got my own mount screws (was able to use black ones that matched - better) as these did not work that well and I did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them."
1258,863,3.0,Given to sister from mysel.  She noted it very compact and discreet in hanging instrument out of way of any impending fracture.
748,863,3.0,"light weight, easy to install, holds very well, does exactly what it was designed to do, hold a guitar on a wall"
516,863,4.0,"I was leery of this since it was half the total price of just about every other one I considered. Because of the return policy I took a chance and am not only glad I did, but am also thoroughly impressed with this hanger.First, I doubt if I could build one for anywhere near the price of this if I purchased the materials locally. Factor in that shipping (at the time of my purchase) is free and this is a no brainer.Installation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hanger.There is one concern you may have. If you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes. Personally, mine are being used to hang a cheap Squire Strat and J-bass, and an Epiphone Les Pail Junior II - instruments more decorative than functional. I am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish, but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decision.The bottom line, though, is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain. In fact, they are probably the best deal you are likely to find and are worth every cent."
1375,863,0.0,"It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.  Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell.  If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own"
1205,863,3.0,"I lost a recording/rehearsal space I shared with some musician friends when it burned down from an electrical fire during 'superstorm' Sandy late last year.  A total loss - and we had no insurance (we sure learned our lesson).So, we rented a new space (this time it's nowhere near the shore) and we are re-building.  We're starting from scratch, and little odds and ends like guitar hangers add up after a while (it's bad enough we had a number of instruments, amps, and other equipment to replace).  So if we can save a few bucks here and there, it helps.I bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good. After I tried it and it worked fine, I went back and bought another 9 of them.  We have guitars, basses, ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them - they work on all sizes.  We use those wide-threaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall.  Like I said, they're nothing fancy, but they get the job done!"
870,863,3.0,"I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio. However, I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didn't want to spend a lot. These did the trick fine. They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way. Especially for the price. Okay, they are not high end, but I didn't need high end ones."
125,863,4.0,"The hanger was very easy to install, holds my acoustics safely,the instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hanger.The product arrived within 2-3 days, I couldn't believe how fast it got here.And yet the price is the best part of all."
547,863,3.0,"The wall mount is very good, adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly. The screws & anchors are poor. If you are not putting this into a stud, go get you some better anchors. Do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only."
948,863,4.0,"While I wouldn't trust these to hold up my electric guitars, I have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now. The 1st one I used to try and hold my Dean From Hell guitar but it just mashed that foam around the yokes into nothing and didn't want it to damage my baby. So I ended up using it to hang my Rock Band guitar. This 2nd one I'm using to hang up my Beats Pros.I chose this product over some simple hook to hang my headphones is because of the foam covered yokes. I figured if you spread the weight over 2 cushioned points instead of a single unprotected point of a hook that the head cushion would hold up better. And the distance of the yokes means that the ear cushions won't ever touch the wall.This is a fantastic product if you understand it's limitations. I would recommend this for acoustic instruments, any type of RB/GH guitars, and probably your lighter/cheaper/mostly plastic electric guitars...or even headphones that you'd like to baby."
609,863,4.0,This is just what I have been wanting for a while now. I have my Les Paul style guitar hanging right by my computer desk and that baby gets played a whole lot more than when it was in the case! A floor stand worked fine until I knocked it over one day:( Now it stays on the wall and away from danger but never out of reach!
20,863,4.0,"It's not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isn't for you. If you are looking for a solid, easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it won't get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you. It works great to hang a standard size guitar on. There is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but I am not sure. It has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar, hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs aren't bumped and hangs straight, just touching the wall with the body. I recommend it."
1039,863,4.0,Great hook!  Supports a lot of weight.  Looks good on any wall.I would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application.
49,863,3.0,"I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need."
104,863,4.0,I have had &#34;swing trees&#34; for many guitars for years. Usually they cost $10-15. This hanger is as good (plastic base not wood like some others) as any of the wood ones. Comes with wall anchors but I usually look for a stud to mount on. Soft cushioning. Weight of guitar keeps the arms (which swivel to allow for proper fit) snug about the neck. The thing came in 2 days and at $4 and free shipping it is a true bargain.
566,863,4.0,"Wanted to hang my guitars on the wall.  These Hooks are padded, and rotate a little.  Provides a strong, non damaging support for some fine guitars.  The difficulty in installing was I wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud.  I had to attach them to a wood board, that I attached to the wall.  This also provided a additiional 3/4&#34; separation from the wall.  The guitars are less likely to bang on the wall."
1121,863,4.0,"I love this wall hanging mount. Of course, you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud, or use drywall backing screws, etc, but that's just common sense.The actual product works perfectly and exactly as described. The arms are adjustable & stay where you put them. This fits my 5string Fender Jazz Bass as well as my acoustic guitar & violin (and even holds the neck without touching the pegs, if you want it to). I will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments.This is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to."
55,863,3.0,"This is a cheaper alternative to the &#34;String Swing&#34; wall mount-- considerably less expensive.  It works fine.  It's easy to mount, easy to adjust and holds the instrument well.  The only downside is that the wall anchors aren't the heavy-duty plastic screw-in types but the smaller drill-a-hole-and-hammer-in-place types, which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others.  Of course you can always purchase a couple of screw-in heavy-duty mounts and you'll still save considerably.This of course doesn't have the beautiful hardwood finish of the String Swing.  For the lower price you get black plastic.  But it's sturdy enough, it looks fine and it does the job.  If it had sturdier wall mounts I'd give it 5 stars.  As it is, the cheaper and less-trustworthy mounts bring it 4 stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative. It is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw-in mounts, should hold any size guitar."
497,863,3.0,"I bought this holder and then mounted it on a stand I built of cherry and maple for my uke.  It does the job.  It could be just a little stiffer in its adjustment, but it stays where I put it, so no complaints."
897,863,4.0,"I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up. The screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that I got are holding guitars to the wall, on drywall nonetheless. So given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem. They all are sturdy enough, and i have always been suspect of wall hangers. best deal and does the job."
740,562,4.0,"I just received my Blue Radius Shock Mount, and I was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit. It reminds me a set piece from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", the rings around Saturn or something built by Tesla. It's a beautiful thing, certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded. Certainly beats the homemade 4 inch PVC pipe and bungee cord shock mount I previously had made and my Yeti mounted to. What is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the Yeti's 3 knob's, mute switch and USB/Headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic, whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access. Once you screw the Yeti into the machined shock mount base, there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position, say a guest speaker with great ease. The build is hefty, machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws. The elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room, as they do on most shock mounts, because they are not threaded on hooks, but securely fastened to brackets, then the holding screws. The Radius also allows you to mount the Yeti on a boom stand, upside down, which I have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture (spit) does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics, it just falls, as gravity allows.Does a shock mount make a difference in sound? To my ears, yes, especially if you are recording into say, a laptop on a table, the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate, coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum. Although the mic stand the Yeti comes with does an O.K. job of dampening vibration, it is not going to give you as much isolation as the Radius, which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up. There is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments, rooms or cabs vibrating your stands, that's why you see most professional studios using shock mounts, you just get a cleaner sound. In a test, the Radius works like a charm, even from pounding on my mixing desk. A 9.0 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration.On the down side, just to play Devils Advocate, The Radius is huge, and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability. That said, the Yeti is also a big microphone, and once mounted, may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly. Next, when you un mount the Yeti from it's built in stand, you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic. I fixed that by screwing the old Yeti stand screws back into the holes, which actually looks kind of neat to me. To some maybe, it will look like bolts in the Frankenstein Monsters neck, but I think it all fits together. Next, smaller base microphone stands will want to tip, either angle the Yeti plus Radius back, or get a bigger stand, this is the one I have and would highly reccomend, theSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand. Lastly, this mount will only work, as far as I can see, with a Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro microphone, maybe some other mics will work, but not likely.In conclusion, the Radius is an easy set up, works great and makes a Yeti look retro/futuristic sexy! Yeah it actually looks really cool, like a spaceship blasting off or landing, take your pick, I know people coming into my studio are going to say, ""What The heck is that, and where can I get one!?"" I may tease and say it's and award or art piece.Addendum 12/13/2011If you thread another shock mount into the Radius, you get double protection. It also looks great to talent in your studio. Over Kill or Uber Cool, you decide. See Pictures."
966,562,1.0,"It did not perform. Looks cool, but thats it. Very large and inconvenient. Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti."
1189,562,2.0,"Cool design, makes a big difference in you audio. Even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew. Screw is actually two pieces (wtf?) of worlds crappiest pot metal.  Supposedly a new tightener design is on the way."
1415,562,3.0,"I started doing quite a bit of VoiceOver work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk. After attaching it to a microphone stand I found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the Yeti Microphone.  This seemed like the best option for that.Upon installing the mount I had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me. Straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you. Unfortunately, if your microphone stand is coming from the sides, you have to take the inner ring out, rotate it to where you want it, and reattach the rubber bands.  Easy enough as I completed this is one minute.After using it for a while, the isolation is good, but not great. I think the bands are a little tight for this microphone. I see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder.  This probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount. It needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings. I have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bands.Going to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a difference.It's does its job, it just could do it better with softer bands."
1036,191,4.0,Just as the others have said.  Its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage.Its a perfect fit for Fender Squire J Bass.  I also got my Samick CR-13 short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for Short Scale bassesBut Im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and I would buy it again
136,191,2.0,This bag is super cheap and flimsy with almost no protection for your guitars at all but since it's reflected in the cost.
311,191,4.0,this is very easy to put the guitar in to because it zips around the whole end and can be carried in your back
387,191,3.0,"Keeps gear dry.Not for airplane travel or shipping, but perfect for spare guitars.Zipper works fine; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much."
548,191,2.0,I recently purchased a Epiphone EB-3 bass and it didn't come with a case/bag. So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try. It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really. Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine. All in all it's an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don't want much padding.
469,245,4.0,should have kept this....I returned it cause I purchased a zoom r16....big mistake!! miss it on smaller projects and my mxl990 sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer.....my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks! he thinks it great too
1030,245,4.0,"it does the job to do my home made music demos, nothing professional though. im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes."
797,245,4.0,"This is my first mixer. I'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and, of course, that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups.Thus, I am an amateur and you'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional.Anyway, my pros and consPros1. This thing is way smaller than I expected. I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn't take up a lot of desk space. It fits well where I put it.2. It works as intended. I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good. I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60%. I have no hissing and no problems. I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host (we do it over Skype) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good. This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3. It's plug and play. I plugged it in, it installed the drivers, and it automatically set itself as the default microphone. Easy peasy.4. I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5. The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1. You can't plug this into a USB hub (or even an AC-powered USB hub) otherwise you'll get a hiss. This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2. This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows. To fix it, open your Control Panel, open the Sound, and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem. Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended. Since I use this as my main mic, I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall, for the price, this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs. I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I'm on a budget. It's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money. If you're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts, this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person. Worth every penny as long as it lasts. I'll update when/if it breaks down but until then, I do not regret this purchase."
35,245,3.0,I bought this for my son so he could record with it. He does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him.
1100,245,4.0,"This mixer is awesome, I couldn't get it where I live, so I bought it on Amazon, it works great!! I plugged my Shure mic, and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In, and also my ipod to the 2track, and everything works great!! Great sound, with the right parameters, you just have to adjust a little here and there, and it will work great, so far no buzz or humm."
318,245,3.0,"Apple threw a curve at me when, with the new ""thin"" iMac, the company eliminated not only the Superdrive but the 3.5mm ""Audio In"" port that had been highly useful on previous models, especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord.  After trying a Griffin and Logitech device, I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface (there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer--the UCA202 and the UCA222). What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, ""dedicated"" USB cord.  Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac (though monitoring required more cords in back--ugh!).For a committed neophyte like me, the UFO202 was probably sufficient.  I miss the permanently attached USB ""out"" cable and, moreover, am questioning whether I'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB, which to my eyes has a bit of a ""learning curve.""  The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual.  Instead of separate sections, the manual uses small, thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions--a minor but unnecessary inconvenience. (But give Behringer credit for providing a manual!)I thought I was investing in more versatility (for a modest price increase) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me.  But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound.  My present programs (Sound Studio and Toast) can't do it, but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources, then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better.  If not, the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs, but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac's desk space (Apple's elimination of the internal burner gives the company ""thin screen"" bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner).Behringer has presented the best solution I've been able to find to Apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest iMac.  If your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks.  But if you have a UFO or UCA interface, your needs may already be covered."
209,245,3.0,"I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of &#60;$125, but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about $12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesn't provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone (not properly disclosed by the company). The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cable.I was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts, interviews, etc., over a simple USB headset, without &#34;breaking the bank&#34;. In addition to the positive reviews on Amazon about most of the Behringer equipment, my son, who has some experience with sound equipment said that Behringer makes solid items, but that I shouldn't expect much in the way of customer service. He's helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expected.I'm glad that I moved up to this board, even though it has a lot of features that I won't personally use. I'm glad that this has two microphone inputs, if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board. Besides the extra mic input, my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBand.I have found that my son's warning is somewhat correct, at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website. Since this is essentially entry level equipment, people like myself, who have little / no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects, particularly in hooking things up to a computer, which is obviously an increasing application.I couldn't find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user, for instance. In addition, it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring, etc. when using with a computer, but they don't. I've done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and run.So far, I'm getting quality recording results from this board. I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMac's line-in. I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire, but I haven't had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound. Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the future.I believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality. I would give 5 stars, but the manufacturer should provide more information."
55,245,3.0,"PROS:* Small. Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf.* If using USB, does not need external power supply.  Very convenient.* Easy-to-use, accessible controls.* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes.* Plug & play with Windows 8.  Didn't have to install any kind of driver.* Variety of input options.  Dual track with low/high volume sliders.* LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range.  Easy to adjust.* Awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a USB-based preamp-only device.* Free shipping-- gotta like thatCONS:* Only one power setting, 15v. That may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike.* Line In / USB buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive.  However the manual shows exact settings for computer use.* As with other low-end Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out.  Can take some fiddling to overcome it.* It's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion.  Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good.NOTES:I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs.  Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems.This unit is very sensitive.  If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room.  With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work.  I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect... but then it's only fifty bucks.  For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, I don't think one could find a better unit.  Two thumbs up.  I don't know how a Pro would rate this... but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average ""USB microphones"" available on the market.  You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal.  Hard to beat at that price.ADDENDUM:  A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast.  No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission.  Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance.  Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp.HINTS AND TIPS:Two good hints on this one:* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery.  It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE.* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound. I have found this to be true. It pretty much takes over your entire sound system. For some folks this will be fine. For others, they may not appreciate this. So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait...)... and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10). This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer. What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity.You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want. This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device. You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well). That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device.In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use. You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables. Works very well in this capacity. Gotta love those new external USB power nodes. : )"
614,578,4.0,"Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply.  Want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one.  No noise or hum.  Has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back.  Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker.  Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs - those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w/ 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters.  Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces.  There is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such.You'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain.  You can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 dB0 range.  It may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately.You could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers.  I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 dB0 off the mixer.Having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation.My **FIRST** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have.  I will have to fabricate some protection.  My second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4"" monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i.e. not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer.  The speaker w/ 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it.  It was not the power supply as being on made the box warm, but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3dB0 into the trs line in.  Thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!I do like this set of speakers.  From stereo to 5.1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs.  I may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already."
217,578,4.0,"Arrived fast, had them up and running in minutes.  It was easy to adjust my EQ on my laptop to produce awesome listening music, just beautiful, clear, nicely separated sound.  I wouldn't use these for high volume stuff, the sound is almost delicate, and very precise in its separation.  The classical musician's in our guild loved the sound, that should tell you something.  Stunning, really.  They are, in fact, exactly what they are advertised to be - top notch small room project studio monitors.  I readjusted my EQ for the needed flat response for sound engineering and I was extremely pleased with the results.  The sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust, as the flat studio mixing EQ sounded horrible at first, as it should!  I have been in and out of studios for 30 years and I can say, used appropriately, these are excellent near-field mixing monitors.  Take time to review the set up data from M-Audio, its good stuff, and don't ask these little beauties to be everything, just let them be what they were made to be . . . and enjoy!  We ended up re-mixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via Cubase 7 and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by 30%."
1201,578,4.0,"These dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me, as I am used to the normal dual cabinet, one amplified set up like the Behringer MS16 which I was trying to replace with these, but on second thought will set them up someplace else, as they do not have front controls, have only one trs or XLR connection point, require AC power for both, and as P Frary has stated are VERY dependent on input; they kind of worked with my Stanton S300, and not at all with my laptop.They are (as stated by other reviewers) very subtle, and may take some getting used to. Because of the dual amps, you don't hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet, as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit.I actually hooked one up like a guitar amp, and it worked fine; just a little guitar amp that sounded great.For your normal Stereo mini jack and RCA hook ups, I would go with the much lower priced MS16's which have multiple RCA jack in points, and one Stereo mini and full front controls.Addendum: 10/13I finally hit a home run with these speaker when I hooked them up to Sony CD changer unit I have for the living room, dialed in the speakers, and put them both on one on/off switch.  The soundis full, and fills the room."
1349,578,4.0,"I'm used to the old 70's and 80's speakers that I've had on my stereo since that time.  I read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before.  I was blown away.  They are all correct, get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing (I listen all the time with different headphones, not the same!).  The way the music was separated so well, I swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals.  I had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out.  I don't know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when I use them to watch movies, listen to music, etc... They have lots of punch, even when I play my guitar through them (POD HD PRO)."
1157,578,4.0,"As the reviews herein have indicated, there is a wide variety of uses for studio monitor like the M-Audio BX5.  With the proper cables, you can hook up everything from an iPad, to a home computer, to a musical instrument or stereo.  I will preface this review by saying that I am no &#34;audiophile&#34;.  I have a basic understanding of speaker and musical equipment, but my primary goal here was to find a small speaker that I could use to monitor guitar playing through either a preamp pedal or iPad modeling software.With those goals in mind, I was pleasantly surprised how good the BX5 sounded.  The goal of any &#34;studio monitor&#34; is to convey as much of the true sound of the source material as possible without coloring the tone with additional equalization.  There are some monitors in a comparable price range like the Rokkit 5 and options from Mackie and JBL - I have not tried those out.  But the BX5 performs we well or better than I hoped.For guitar playing, I use it in close proximity on a desktop.  I found that it had a surprising amount of low end punch for a 5&#34; woofer, given that my Fender tube amp has a speaker twice the size!  The bass is tight and articulate, which is what you want.  Again, if your goal is just to drown out the sound with additional base, go get a pair of Beats headphones or hook up a dozen subwoofers to it.  That wasn't really my goal.  But all that aside, having enough low end was important to me, and the BX5 delivers.  Using modeling of &#34;Fender&#34; and &#34;Vox&#34; type amplifiers, it also handled the high end &#34;chime&#34; well without sounding &#34;tinny&#34;.I should note that I got an XLR (microphone) cable that converts to TRS on the other side.  I had heard/read that this was the best way to get a guitar signal into the thing, though there are likely adapters and other cables you could use to accomplish the same thing.  There are both XLR and TRS inputs on the back.  The monitor is powered, so there's a power cable, as well.  There is a volume knob, but no independent bass/treble adjustment, as on other monitors.  So if you want that, look elsewhere, but if the monitor is actually relaying most of source tone, you shouldn't be using it anyway.  Really enjoying my BX5 so far, wish I had the budget/space for a 2nd one!"
227,481,2.0,"This is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very easily.  Get one of these and you'll soon have guitar picks coming out of your ears.  My only issue is that a pick punched from, say, an old credit card isn't going to replace my favorite picks.  It's a great idea, it's executed very well, no issues with the product itself, but I find that it's not incredibly useful to me.If you're not particularly picky (no pun intended) then one of these will supply you with picks for a lifetime."
546,481,4.0,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials. She has used it many times using things such as old ID cards, plastic laminates, and expired credit cards. In all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick."
644,481,4.0,"As a guitarist, I lose and find picks everywhere. I hate buying them because I know they are somewhere in my house but I just can't find them. With this, I take all my old credit cards, student ID cards, playing cards, etc. and make my own. I now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me. It rocks, pun intended.Bottom Line: Every guitarist should have one. No excuses."
891,481,4.0,This is a wonderful item that really works! Arrived fast! Having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards! This makes a great gift item!
495,481,4.0,"I'm a pro musician and music teacher. These are the original pick punches, by the company from the guy who invented them... At least that's what it says on his website. The others are knockoffs.  They probably all work about the same, and they're all about the same price now, so why not support the dude who invented them. He's really into making picks, and has some pretty cool ideas and instructions on his website. I'm pretty crafty, and really like this. Bummed about rough edges? Buy a fine sanding sponge at any hardware store, sand the edges for a few seconds, and be done with it. He also sells sheets of plastic from his website, at quite good prices, and ink for stamping them. I got a cheap rubber stamp made with my URL for about $10 online, and make my own ""business card"" picks now. I also found some cool sheets of celluloid on eBay, it's not easy to find the right stuff but the picks I make now are just as good as any you would purchase, and the cost is way less for personalized pics anyway. If you need hundreds or thousands of picks made, well then you're better off ordering them, but I have fun making 10 or 20 of them at a time to hand out to potential students and clients. Oh yeah, I can still recycle old cards and stuff too, my students like bringing them in and making their own picks as well. Everybody knows that picks just evaporate when you lose them anyway, what could possibly be greener?"
1337,708,4.0,"When this little plastic gizmo arrived, I admit I had low expectations for it. At first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and I figured the plastic would soon break. I really did not expect much accuracy in tuning, either.I have used this for a couple of months now, switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well.I may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck. Good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner. It works as well as my expensive model I was using and I don't have to stick it on the guitar body. Worth checking out!"
1222,708,3.0,"I have the older version of this as well this newer one.  The older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way, like banjos, mandolins.  Sometimes this new one just won't &#34;hear&#34; the string being tuned unless it's 'encouraged'.  That wasn't the case with the first model.  It's not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate.  The buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it. You could find the tuning being done several semi-tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons.  The older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices.  And these won't clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut, spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock.  But if you get it well clamped, it will stay there in the case or in use."
57,708,4.0,"You know, any time a company actually sticks a battery in the box with their product, it just puts a smile on my face. Planet Waves has not only made a great, small, easy to install and easy to use tuner, they included the battery. That's an A+ in my book.I've got a 12-string acoustic guitar. Pretty much every time I go to sit down and play, I would waste a good 5 minutes grabbing my old tuner, balancing it on my knee, and trying to tune up. With this head stock tuner sitting on the guitar, I just turn it on and quickly get in tune and down to the serious business of jamming. It truly makes the task many times easier. The display is easy to read. It's read when the string is way off and green when you're close, using lines on either side of the key/letter to indicate sharp or flat, or right smack dab in tune.If I had the money, I'd stick one of these on all my guitars. As it is, having it on my 12-string is going to save me hassle and time. This baby is worth every penny and I highly recommend it to any guitarist."
1038,708,1.0,This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. I play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen. It worked but I don't use it anymore.
562,708,2.0,"I put this on my mandolin.  This does not work as well as some others I have tried, but the other one I was using broke very easily, so I looked for a different, more sturdy design.  This works OK.  Not the greatest, but OK."
1055,708,3.0,"Broke one of my Snark tuners when I kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided I needed a tuner I could keep on any guitar while it was in any case.Pros:- Fits on any guitar- ...which then fits in any case- Cheap- AccurateCons:- Calibration button and on/off button are same shape, same size, and on the same tiny surface. Very easy to hit the wrong one.- Not great (poor viewing angle) for 3-on-a-side tuners (works better for 6 in-line tuners)- Not as easy to read as the SnarkOther thoughts:I only use this on a guitar that I play for only one song at shows (because the song requires two capos and a detuned string, don't ask.) I much prefer the Snark, but apparently I can't be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away. Idiot. At shows I rely on a tu-2 stompbox for tuning. Basically, this is a niche tuner. It's so stinking small and that's what counts."
372,708,4.0,"This miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing. Just remember to turn it off, or the display will prove distracting. During winter when a guitar or mandolin &#34;moves&#34; with changes in humidity, staying in tune is an issue, even for expensive instruments. This little device helps the player deal with the problem without constant recourse to a larger tuner."
1348,708,4.0,"item is really convienient. Small, unobtrusive size w/ good illumination for easy reading. I like the swivel design & swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want. Price can't be beat either."
599,708,4.0,Small... very small and sits right behind the headstock and very easy to see and READ. It is very accurate.  What else can I say except that this is a really great idea and it works!!!
426,708,4.0,"This is another great product by D'Addario - I have used several tuners like the regular Snark (several versions), the Snark S1 Mini Clip (also known as 'Son of a Snark'), the Planet Waves Headstock Tuner, the Peterson SC-1 Strobo Tuner, the Korg HTB-1 and the Q7 Chromatic Headstock Tuner. This D'Addario Micro NS Tuner tops all those with ease. It is super easy to use and more precise than all the others (compared using several tuning computer softwares and the Korg Pitchblack floor pedal on my tests). The rotation feature is great and the visual metronome feature comes very handy, like when programming a delay pedal with more precision. The clip that holds the tuner to the guitar is very good, holds very well to your guitar headstock (doesn't matther the brand) and with stay snug there without damaging your guitar's finish. It is very light and you will hardly know it's there once playing - Highly recommended. Cheers!"
133,708,3.0,"I have used many clip-on guitar tuners. They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on. I have several of them and use them often on many guitars. Based on this experience, I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up getting.It tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. Others found it awkward to attach - I did not. It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. Those are not problems. What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.This fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.The fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. This clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted, I have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. I leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. Based on this belated realization, I have raised the product rating to 4-stars."
1410,708,4.0,"When I got this I thought it was a cheap toy-like thing, but when I put it on my banjo, it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else, but easy to see when I needed it.  It's red when out of tune and green when in tune.  It does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned.  I love it when I am the only one using it.  Unlike the clamp kind, like the Snark, it's hard to share.  The clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to, so between my husband and me using it, I'm afraid the thing will break.  I play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head, but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it."
148,708,2.0,"This is a decent to good little tuner, but there are some drawbacks to it.  Also, I have the otherPlanet Waves Chromatic Headstock Tunerto compare this one to.  Here are the pros and cons of this tuner as I see them:Pros:- Super compact.  Virtually invisible from the front of the guitar.- Adjustable frequency settings.- Top load battery.  No need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery.Cons:- Awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock.  I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it.- Less gradation in setting than other tuners.  The gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number, giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning.Debatable:- Clip mechanism: Not spring loaded.  This means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar.- One battery: This unit takes only one battery versus two with the other.When it boils down to it, I prefer my old planet waves tuner.  It seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations (though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning - using both at the same time) and I like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry.  In fact I can easily recommend that tuner, main drawback is that that one eats batteries)This tuner is more catered to Fender-style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on.  For those players, bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars.  For others, I highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review."
12,708,4.0,"I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments.  Though I am not a professional musician, I find each them to be of equal accuracy.  In fact, the D'Addario's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size, it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation.  A great choice for the price."
1232,708,4.0,"Disclaimers:1. Obtained free as part of Amazon's Vine program2. Tested on 4 ukuleles and one guitarSo, ukulele players: Yes, this tuner is for you.I tested this diminutive tuner on:- Sopranino (Ohana)- Soprano (Pono)- Concert (Kala)- 8-string Tenor (Pono)It's TINY so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there.  It's a bit problematic on the Sopranino, as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side, so it need to clip to the top.Tuning is easy.  Just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen. If it's red, you're off; if it's green, you're in tune.When you're off, little bars will display by the note letter: left if you're low, right if you're high. Tune in the direction needed until there's one bar on each side of the note and the note's name turns green. Quick and easy.I've compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it's dead accurate.As others have noted, the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock.  But, it's held together fine so far and I've had it for weeks."
1051,708,3.0,"I wanted to use this thing for a while, before I reviewed it (I now own five of them).  When I compare it head to head (so to speak) with other tuners, even the ones built into my Ovation guitars, I find that this one has a little higher resolution.  That is, when the others say I'm good, this one says ""no, you need to go one tick more"".  That's not saying that it's inaccurate, it's saying that this one seems to dial you in just a little bit tighter than the others, but it still does it very quickly.  Since I never take it off of the guitar, I went ahead and trimmed off the little tabs on the front of the clamping mechanism, making it even more unobtrusive.  You can barely tell it's there from the front."
472,708,2.0,"The NS Mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi-octave range of electric bass, guitar and mandolin. The accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button.The tuner's view window is slightly larger than a Chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly-lit spaces.  One thing that's less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself. If you've ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what I mean. I'd wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker, so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing, a lighter color may work better.The notes appear red when out of tune; their color changes to green as a `rough marker'.  You then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note.  They've gone to lengths to make the tuner stage-friendly, but I'd much prefer the green color mean ` fine tuned and done'.  That way I can look from a distance. I should only have to bother with the bars if I'm struggling to home in (and in my experience that's the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by: new strings, slack under the bridge pins, a slipping tuner, etc.  Mid-life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably, so long as you don't use a lot of altered tunings.The NS is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back. I'm a lefty and, unlike some other tuners, I appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right-side up.The viewer doesn't extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my L4 with large New Yorker-style tuners.  On headstocks with more bare wood like a Strat, or even my A-style mandolin, it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn't obstruct my hand while turning keys.At first I didn't like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock. I could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like I needed two to remove it: one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out. After a little practice, however, I found this wasn't the case and the touch required isn't difficult at all.The tuner's constructed in a high-impact composite, similar to those parachute-style clamps you see on backpacks. It feels durable and very unlikely to break, although I didn't try stomping on it.I was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag.  The battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin. The tuner has an auto-shutoff function to preserve battery life.The power and frequency buttons are just nibs really; I'd prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them. The tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from 430 to 450 if 440 doesn't work for you.One advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren't limited to (usually) diatonic open strings.  For myself, I only use tuners to set the pitch of one string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin. In my opinion, tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics - and neither does the job well. Intonation is subject to a bunch of variables: string action and thickness, neck relief, fret condition, nut and bridge condition.Once I have a single string to pitch I match fretted and open string unisons and octaves. After a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument.I used to love staring at those Pignose-sized 'strob-a-tuners' sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately (I wish many more did). I'm not quite sure how we went from, 'We tune because we care' to 'I'm so embarrassed to be standing here tuning I hope no one notices', but the NS Mini Headstock tuner - questionable design choices and all - does what it says with a minimum of fuss."
82,708,2.0,I want to like this more but it's not as good as my other tuners. Tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not. As easy as the little round ones from Snark. I like those better and they're cheaper.
586,708,4.0,"I have bought several small tuners through the years, but this one has become a favorite. It is Tiny, but the screen is well lit and quite legible. It fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front. There is a metronome function, which I haven't used. Simply strike a string. If it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars. When the key is in tune, you will see a green indicator light and 1 bar on each side. I don't know how dependable and how long it will last since I have only had the two for about a month."
269,708,4.0,"I have another headstock tuner that I've had for awhile.  This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well.  The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky, but the tuner works like a champ.  Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions.  Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money.  The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off."
804,708,4.0,"This little tuner is sweet! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly. Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics, but for the 6-in line guitars it's perfect. It is very precise and accurate, leading you to perfect tuning every use. I totally recommend this product - you won't be dissappointed."
417,708,4.0,I Normally use my KORG foot-switch tuner for my guitar and basses... this guy really had me believing in small-vibration-tuning.Three key words for this: Accurate + Small + InBeat!
7,708,3.0,"Ok, this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems.  Cons: Minor one would be, that when mounted, the face of the tuner doesn't exactly face your eyes, you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you. But the biggest CON is.... it's pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig. In sunlight, its TOO dim! ha ha!  At home or at a night gig its fine. Daylight? Forget it."
340,708,1.0,"Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. I just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way."
914,708,4.0,"OK - I like this one a lot.  It stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime.  It is accurate, easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing.  It sure beats the other units I have used where you clamp on some weird thing, tune up and then stash back in your gig bag.This one is... bing! - on, tune and back to playing.  It weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up."
0,708,3.0,"First, I've noticed that many reviews here are for the ""original"" NS tuner, the one with only two buttons and ""coin slot"" battery cover. This one is a little smaller, has a metronome flasher, and the battery installs differently, but the name/model evidently didn't change.  I compared this new one, the ""original"", and the latest Snark on dreadnought guitar, mandolin, and 5-string banjo.Pros: Size, size, and SIZE!!Reasonably accurateMounting clip better than beforeGood priceMetronome flasher maybe for some?Cons:  Display not as bright as othersContrary to their description, this one seems less sensitive than original.Battery compartment difficult to openMay not fit well on some headstocks. On my wife's A style mandolin it fits but barely. On my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits.  That being said, I haven't found anything I can't use it on.My take.... The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy, lock in speed, and visibility however I really dislike the ""eyeball on a stick"" form factor and refuse to use it on stage!  I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument, I even in leave 'em on in the case. The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me. I'll keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that D'Adarrio (or someone) improves on it with a better processor and LED."
646,708,3.0,"I've been playing guitar more than 35 years and have used a lot of electronic tuners.  The first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today.  But it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing.  Over the years tuners have gotten smaller, cheaper, and easier to use.  The Planet Waves PW-CT-12 is my new favorite.It is very small - a little bit larger than a grape.  Despite some of the other reviews I have used it with good results on a Strat, Tele, Les Paul, and ES-335 electrics and on acoustics from Martin, Gibson, National Resophonic, and Voyage Air.  I clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low-E tuner.  I didn't expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing.  Previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock.  Small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock I have to read it upside down.  The PW-CT-12 is nicely out of the way even when I play an F chord with my thumb on the low E string.  It's so light I don't notice it's there.The display is bright and easy to see in most light.  A bit hard to read in direct sunlight but I do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway.  The display is small - a dime can cover most of it - but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position.  The '#' sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it.  (No flat symbol.  Bb is displayed as A#.)  The tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer.  The display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning.  It's red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune (for example, |E|).  I found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs.These are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin.  Rough handling will probably break it.  I notice that the clamp is easily removed so I'm guessing Planet Waves may sell replacements.  The clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it.  It is a ratchet rather than a clamp.  You press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck.  For this reason this is not a tuner to pass around.  It's meant to be left on an instrument.  (It's small enough that you can leave it on in the case.)  If you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better (and larger) choices.  It can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget.  I'm going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars.Other reviewers commented on accuracy.  If you want strobe accuracy there are better choices.  For that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display.  This tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary.  I haven't had a problem except with guitars that have built-in intonation problems (like old Nationals) and they need tweaking even after a Peterson Strobe.Soapbox: especially if you are a new player, do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear!  Try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check.  Learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than I have time to list.  Being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill.  People that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that, if ever."
404,708,2.0,"I thought to try this tuner after my gig bag decided to break my Snark SN-2's neck (fragile plastic socket of the ball & socket joint bent with stress). Functionally, I prefer the SN-2, which seems to do slightly more sample averaging while remaining responsive, displaying less &#34;bounciness.&#34; I also prefer the SN-2 display. However, there's *a lot* to be said about the small form factor, which I can leave on the headstock without risk of damage. Now I keep an NS on each of the mandolins that travel with me and I keep a Snark clipped to the music stand at home."
1058,708,2.0,"It stays out of the way on my guitar, however, be aware that the mounting tab gets a little loose.  I am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip."
38,708,3.0,"I bought this tuner for my mandolin.  I have to play a little louder than I'd like for the tuner to hear me.  The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays I've seen.  But it's so small that I never have to take it off, and it's doing its job well.  I'm pretty fond of this little guy."
242,708,3.0,"The Planet Waves tuner works effectively on acoustic and electric guitars, using the instruments vibrations to read pitch.  The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate, is lightweight, and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience.  It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A-440.  Note that the photo of the tuner shows it on the headstock of a Fender-style electric guitar.  It works particularly well on the instrument shown because of the fact that the tuners are all on the same side of the headstock.  On something like a Gibson jazz guitar (ES-175, or one of the Epiphone or Ibanez clones, for example) it's more difficult to find an ideal place to attach the tuner.  Classical and acoustic steel-string guitars are also a tad problematic, too.  It's not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks, it's just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable right-side up.  Some headstocks, too, may be too thick in order to attach this tuner.  As long as it fits on your guitar, the Planet Waves tuner is highly recommended."
91,708,4.0,"I primarily play live and I am a tone-o-holic. In other words, I use high end pedals, cables, amps and pickups and try to keep as little as possibel between my guitar and amp. I bought a couple of these so I could have one on both my main and backup guitar. No more need for a pedal based tuner. These work that well and are almost undetectable from the front. They also won't mark up your prized instrument."
396,708,2.0,"This guy is great if you want to mount it on your guitar without a big clip-on gizmo that people see easily. Downside is that it is so small it's hard to tell what button you are pushing and it's not terribly easy to turn off and on (Do I push again? Push and hold?). Also, the screen to read if you are in tune is so small that sometimes judging how close you are to being in tune is hard. This being said, it's a nice tuner and stays on. Also, I should point out that while it does clip on, it's not as easy to move from one instrument to the other as some other tuners."
138,708,3.0,"One was Dead on Arrival, the other one works like a champ. I like the old version more. These are a little tricky to mount but do track well, and are not obnoxious looking like the Snark tuners."
521,708,0.0,"The device itself is difficult to read in bright light.My first one arrived not working at all.The second one arrived with a low battery. What? After three days the battery goes out.I would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. You've been warned."
597,708,2.0,"I bought the two pack and I've found them both to be a bit finicky. Sometimes they turn on right away and other times you have to click the button a couple times to get it to light up. When they're on and working they work well and I like the small size and tight profile against the headstock, I just wish they were a little more reliable."
346,708,3.0,"I purchased a couple sets of these to try them out.  They are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune.  They seem slower to lock then my Snark tuners, and the visual scale is not as precise, but they do seem to work fairly well.  The ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars, and they can be stored in the case attached.  Its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it.UPDATE:  Downgrading my rating by 1 star.  Having used four NS MicroTuners for a couple of weeks, on four different instruments, I have to say that, in comparison to my Snark tuners, the NS Micro Tuner is slow to lock, and difficult to tune precisely.  With the Snark (any of them...I have several models) I can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds.  With the NS Microtuners, I have to repeatedly pluck a string, and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment.  Sometimes I have to pluck a string several times before the NS Microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all!  It is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target. |E| would be a perfectly tuned ""E"", but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort.  I still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check, but when I want to be precise (and fast) I always reach for the Snark."
402,708,2.0,"Seems like it draws current, even when it's OFF. I have two guitars, and this thing stays with one guitar. I make sure to turn this tuner OFF before putting the guitar away, and when I get around to playing the guitar again (7 to 10 days later), the battery is already drained. This happened at least three times already. The tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that I have to compare against. I don't know which one is more accurate. The good thing is it's very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it. I probably won't buy again for my other (and future) guitars."

495,708,2.0,"I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner. Not sure if I lost it at a gig, or my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I'd bet the latter.This micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini, which is nice. That's about the only Pro. There are a few other features I guess, like being able to select the instrument used, but I don't need that.Cons: The readout is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be as bright. I play a lot of outdoor weddings, in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini.This micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini. As you move closer to In tune, the bars do not smoothly move towards the center, so it's easy to over or under tune, and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done. And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.Does it get the job done? Yes. But there is a product that's almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference. It might even be cheaper. If you're a beginner and want to select the instrument you're tuning and a few extra seconds isn't an issue, or you play in dark environments and don't need a super bright readout, this will be fine, but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one."
87,708,3.0,"Update:  We received a replacement for this item. It does everything it was advertised to do, and it performs quite well, although the clip on the new one doesn't grip as well as the first.  The device tunes within 6/10ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner. Our thanks to D'Addario for their assistance in satisfying this customer!Please check our reviews.  We review regularly, and rarely have anything poor to say about products.Unfortunately, we cannot remain positive with this device.  Our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready.  We have several NS1 models that work flawlessly, as well as TG-200 models that we really like.This one seems to consume coin-cell batteries at an unacceptable rate.  On average, it 'eats' a battery a day.  It also has a much darker display, making it hard to read unless the stage is quite dark.  One would think that if the display were darker, less power would be drawn from the battery.  Average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner.We do like the ability to rotate the display, so that the tuner can be mounted in front or behind the headstock, with the display maintaining proper orientation. Unfortunately the poor performance means that this unit will find its way into the junk-drawer on the workbench."
1413,708,3.0,"I own several small tuners, including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark. In comparison to those, I would say its most like the Enote when it comes to size, but definitely more accurate and responsive.  In comparison to the Snark, its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning.  Its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the Snark. Anyway, it all comes down to preference I suppose.  I would recommend it."
438,708,4.0,"Use this on my Taylor acoustic-electric which does not have a built in tuner.  Love it - it hides very nicely on the headstock - your audience won't even see it.  What else can I say - it's accurate, it works, it clamps on really neatly & securely, it's a great price, it has not marred the finish on my Taylor's headstock in any way, etc....  I'd recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a built-in tuner.  Would definitely buy again !!!These are so cool that everyone should have at least one of these even if you don't need one  :)  !!!"
238,708,4.0,Yes!  I finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock!  It never needs to be removed!  It's accurate.  It's easy to use.  It's low-profile.  Highly recommended.
22,708,2.0,"I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners.  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most."
745,708,4.0,This little tuner is excellent. Very accurate. I love it. I have other tuners but this one is the best. I didn't realize it was so small. I was concerned when I first open the package because of it's size. But this mini tuner is just plain amazing. I'm glad I bought it.
819,708,3.0,"This tuner is tiny and accurate. Initially, the instructions were somewhat puzzling to me because there were no diagrams next to the instructions. For example, the instructions read, ""Press the tuner's release lever to open the tuners ratchet clamp."" Uh, ok. I had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked. After I figured it out, I'd have to say that I don't like this mechanism. I prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp. But I do like the rotation of the display. As for tuning, I had difficulty tuning the low E string on my travel-sized guitar. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the display jumps around a lot even with the ""tip"" of plucking the string with a light to moderate stroke. For my full-sized guitar, the tuning was easier, but I had some difficulty on the low E string. Tuning my concert ukulele was relatively easy except for tuning the E string again proved to be more effort. Just for fun, I tuned a full-sized cello with great results, but there was no easy way to clamp the tuner on. Another experiment I ran was checking out the tuner in a room with another instrument playing. After tuning the instruments, I checked the tuning against another tuner and the mini tuner was spot on. Although concealing the tuner from my audience isn't a concern of mine, I would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern. Otherwise, the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me."
253,708,3.0,"After years of having a large, awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on. So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you're already on the stage.I love that the lights are bright and easy to see, unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read. Dark grey letters on a light grey screen. Even better is that the light colors are different for flat, sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier. May not seem like a big deal when you're tuning alone at your house, but when you're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place, those little details really help.The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs. Not impossible, but not terribly convenient, either. It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head.The $80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine, and quite frankly, 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it. In fact, the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case. Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home, but like this one better on stage because it's low profile. Looks more professional and I like that."
88,708,4.0,"First it tunes very accurately. Second its low profile, I keep it tucked under the head stock, the crowd can't really see and I it is completely usable if I need to quickly tune during the set and my ears aren't cutting it.  Third, buy it if you are looking for a new tuner."
826,708,4.0,"Cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele. Small and unobtrusive, unlike my other digital tuners.  I like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance.  Highly recommended."
1344,708,4.0,Very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and don't want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find.
379,708,4.0,"I ordered this because I have an Ovation, and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstock.Due to the small size and adjustable clip, this tuner fit perfectly, and well out of the way. It took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the ON/OFF button, but no problem now.As a tuner, I really like it. The small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light (haven't tried it in bright light yet), the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable, and it did a great job in a noisy gig, where I changed tunings about 10 times during the evening."
55,708,2.0,"This is a product that is unique, tiny and would be very useful-- if it were more accurate.  The problem is it's just not responsive enough.  To get it to work one has to place it low on the headpiece (next to the nut) and strum a string pretty loud for a consistent register.  Placing it at the top of the headpiece it simply doesn't pick up enough string vibration to register well.The problem with placing it next to the nut is that it then makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wall-mount guitar hanger.  That may seem like a small issue... but not if you use such a device regularly (as many home-players do).  Myself, I have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall.That doesn't make this valueless.  You can always clip it on the top of the headpiece and then move it when you're ready to tune.  Thus I give it 3 stars.  However there are other more responsive tuners, such as the capo-tuners we've seen on Amazon lately.  They're about the same price (actually, the capo tuners are a bit less-expensive) but I've found the capo-tuners to be considerably more responsive.So bottom line, I'm not impressed.  These aren't an expensive tuner comparatively speaking, and that's good.  But they' really don't do all that great a job.  They're unresponsive enough that I honestly think a person might break a string before realizing the tuner isn't responding to the current string pluck.Note to Ovation guitar players:  this is not the clip-on tuner for you.  There's simply no place to clip it.  Fortunately my Ovation has built-in tuning, but if you have an Ovation Acoustic, you'll want a different tuner."
789,599,4.0,Easily installed on my parlor guitar. The oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl. Installation is not rocket science.
61,599,4.0,"These end pins are so simple and logical that I'm surprised it's taken the design process this long to get to this point. I used to use Schaller straplocks but they're not compatible with all straps. If the end leather/material is too thick, the lock won't fit. I enjoy the elliptical endpin design, as it helps me feel confident the strap will stay on, but I can easily remove the strap or use another on the guitar. I highly recommend you try this out if you're looking for a great way to keep your strap secured."
1098,599,3.0,"Item came with two sets of screws, a long set and a shorter set. Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar. Holds my strap well. I am happy I bought this."
340,599,4.0,"I must first state for the record, I hate strap locks. Hate may be a bit shy of the mark, actually. I've never met a set I liked in any single way.  I've only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it. In fact, EVERY instrument I've owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune. Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed- even with Locktite. When you install them, you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material (leather, nylon, etc), so it is never really tight. Plus there's only about two threads on the slim little nut, and if they aren't a really tight match to the other half, wear very quickly (especially since you have to tighten them so often). Duncan type often suffer from 'non-positive lock syndrome' if not regularly cleaned and lubed. Then there's the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons, your strap is only compatible with the ones which match. And then there is the the metal-on-metal clankyness. Yuck. Oh, and and the cost. Moving on.Why are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant? They are NOT strap locks. If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them - as you should, then in order to put your strap on and take it off, you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument. This isn't something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage. Sometimes the simplest design is the best design. And they're pretty, too.Downsides? I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short, but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly. If they don't, using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer- especially considering if the screws cut new threads, you're pretty much- uh, screwed. The washers these come with are pretty small too, so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons. With a brand new strap, they can be a bit tricky to get on, but just as tricky to get off (which is good). That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap, especially if it is made from cheap materials. With older straps, just as with any traditional strap button, you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap, but it is very easy to verify, and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button. Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly. But with strap locks, if there's a problem, you'll have to grab some tools to fix it - or replace it entirely. Talk about a false sense of security. With PE's Elliptical End Pins, you just put the strap where it should be and you're set.If you are one who is taken to doing back-flips, or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula-hoop onstage, then these probably won't save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey's worst intentions. But if either of these antics are your norm, you might be better served by a permanently attached strap, or perhaps therapy.Since writing the review above, I've ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses. I'm done with traditional strap buttons and don't imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks."
252,599,4.0,"Brilliant solution to the strap button problem! The pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won't slip off! Works as well as locking strap buttons did, for me."
597,599,4.0,I like these little guys. I'm not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price.
1031,11,2.0,"It works and cleans the strings, but its durability is a little low, for about 2 months. I recommend Planet Waves String Cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner."

67,11,4.0,"I have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any.  I like the applicator, and will just need to see how long it lasts."
657,23,4.0,"The perfect wall mount for a ukulele. My daughter loves it. Instrument looks great on her wall, and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice. Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws (or mount to wall studs)."
236,23,4.0,I don't know why others rated it as a 4 star.  It is exactly what it says it is and works fine.
494,23,4.0,"I'm a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars.  I learned a long time ago that guitar-like instruments ought to  be hung by the neck, as one finds them in a music store, to minimize neck warpage, and all my instruments are hung.  This is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele, but I also thought the instrument would double as wall art.So when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric-acoustic uke from Hawaii, I immediately went shopping for a wall hanger.  There are more expensive ones out there, but this wooden String Swing turned out to be perfect.  Easy to install, holds the uke perfectly, and the whole thing looks great on the wall.  Call me a satisfied customer.JM Tepper"
1160,23,2.0,"While this hanger is not unattractive, and is well built I could and will modify it to better suit my needs.  The design of the hanger causes the neck of the &#34;uke&#34; to stand off of the wall 2+ inches at the head and 3-1/2 inches at the hanger itself and 3 inches at the base of the body.  This is not an easy fix but it is doable."
537,23,4.0,"Just like the ones in the store.  We mounted our two ukes on these.  Put our hangers in studs, but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall.  Heavy duty and nice looking.  Great price.  You just can't beat the speed and convenience of Amazon."
1186,392,3.0,"Great deal for the price. Works fine, but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric. Did the job for what I needed. Now I know I would love a better one like a Fishman."
1398,392,4.0,this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost 4 tom 5 times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one
1243,392,3.0,"If you're the kind of player that 'beats' on an acoustic like I do you'll find the sound hole pickup is an obstruction that you're constantly picking against causing loud clicks, pops and bangs.Very accurate pickup otherwise"
923,392,4.0,"It works very well, installs easily, stays in place once installed but can be removed easily.  Does not scratch guitar's finish (just be careful, and no issues).  It will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar, but it comes very close.  A great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric."
734,392,3.0,when it works good its great but sometimes it gets static-y I wish it had a volume in line not much more to say
261,392,4.0,This pickup is actually a really great product for what it is! I hooked it up to my acoustic and plugged it into my line 6 amp and shredded a little bit.It's NUTS being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic!!!!
714,392,3.0,This is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric.  I did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close.
751,392,3.0,"A couple of my friends and I own this pickup and use it to amplify our acoustic guitars through a mixer and loudspeaker system.  Works really well considering how inexpensive it is.  It's very easy to install and remove, but be sure you have a fairly standard-sized sound hole in your guitar to ensure that it will fit and be reasonably stable."
984,392,3.0,"I had just bought an electric acoustic and while I was ordering that I just went ahead and picked one of these up as well because I figured what the heck it's under $20 and maybe my full size acoustic might work well with it. So I got it and th only thing I had an issue with is that it slide around a little too easily, but, it does work well. I recommend it for those who are looking for a simple solution to making their acoustic, electric so that they can play it through their amp."
74,392,4.0,I purchased this to use until I get the replacement to my Ovation CC28 and it is load and clean. For $20.00 it is worth all day.
134,392,4.0,"I've used my HDE pickup for about a month now. I use it with a Fender Frontman amp. The sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost. I highly recommend this product. I'll probably get a second one for a backup, while I can get it at the present price."
11,392,2.0,Low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming. For the price it is a good deal.
177,392,4.0,I was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad I did!! I am now able to play/ record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers. Does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound. I recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar!!
357,351,4.0,"Have used them for years, bought some new guitars, had to have.  Wish they had something for Acoustic Electric 1/4&#34; backplug"
783,351,4.0,I put them on a Dipinto Mach V with that Levis Rat fink guitar strap I need to exchange. I use this on all my guitars. I tried some off brands and I've found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal.
51,351,3.0,"I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks pre-installed.  I've used Dunlops before, but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass, so I just bought the Schaller buttons.  I don't quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops, but there's no question about the quality -- these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon."
485,670,3.0,"Sounds great, easy to adjust.  Nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board. Worth price hands down."
1131,670,3.0,"This is a very basic delay pedal, with the obvious knobs: delay volume, time and repeats. It has a nice bright sound, never too muddy and it's perfect for some Dave Gilmour style slap back delays.It only works with a power adapter, no battery. This has its pros and cons: on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less, on the other side if your power adapter breaks you're out of luck!Unlike many similar pedals this one doesn't let you set infinite repeats: this makes it impossible to make tricks a la Johnny Greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises. This is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals, so I returned it. Nonetheless, the product itself is great: cheap, sturdy and it does exactly what it's supposed to do."
367,670,4.0,does a good job for a basic delay...good for rockabilly and 50's slap echo. I needed it for nothing else so I'm happy. :)
685,670,3.0,"Just got it, so far so good. I use delay pretty light n tight - slapback vibe, not too wet. This does it well. I considered the MXR delay - no - I may have considered it but the only pedal failure I've ever experienced was my MXR/Dunlop Phase 90, first the DC input, then the stomp switch, after light/barely any bedroom use. This ModTone here, seems solidly constructed. I haven't played with it too much yet, but as of right now, I wouldn't recommend it for Edge wannabes, seems limited in that regard. I may be wrong, but either way, do we need more Edge wannabes?No, we do not.Good tone though, does the trick, trick."
97,530,4.0,"Good design, easy to hang on to these picks.  Reasonable price makes it even better.  I don't often use picks, but when I do, I use these.  I will buy more in the future."
1141,530,4.0,"I collect picks (or plectrums if you're a purist) and that's because I'm trying to see how & where I can use a new pick. My first pick was a shark fin and I loved all of the ways you could hit the strings with those picks. Now we have the BEEHOLD picks.What I like about this pick is the 'stinger' or the longer point to hit the strings with. Sure the octagon hole in the center makes it less of a challenge to hold on to but that's not been much of a hindrance to me. Rather this pick's design makes it easier for my holding hand to hit the strings without my palm's fleshy part accidentally touching the strings.I found running leads & scales with this pick to be a delight! I like heavier picks so I chose the 1.00 mm as that was the size I started off with from my first guitar teacher who recommended heavy picks. I've found this pick to be great for strumming & rhythm patterns equally as well as for serious lead playing.Another thing is that with the design, I've found that I need not squeeze this pick as hard as I have to like I do with a Tortex pick and that makes playing so much more fun.Overall I give this pick 5 out of 5 stars & will be using these for many years to come."
131,530,4.0,"I like this pick ,the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers , its not soft or to hard of a pick ,,I like it,"
729,530,3.0,"Bought this pick looking for options around the old ""dropped pick"" syndrome. I was skeptical, as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most. However, once between thumb and index finger, these darlings hang on!"
394,530,3.0,"Not my favorite pick but pretty close, they are solid and haven't dropped one yet..I wish someone would make a grippy texture pick with a hole in it too..."
1338,530,4.0,"I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus. I have several bad habits, including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point. On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds (0.5mm,) and really like them. The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required, and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot. The pick is fairly long, but I have not had any accuracy problems with them, and so far durability has been good.I still use other picks too, but I really like these and can't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand."
1421,530,2.0,"I wanted to try the Clayton Beehold picks to see if the hole would help me grip the pick better so that it doesn't rotate in my hand.The .80 pick is a little too heavy for my style of playing but the hole is a neat idea and did seem to help a bit, but I gave up on the pick pretty quickly due to the stiffness."
1222,126,3.0,"This holder grips the IPad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue.  The rotation to vertical is good but it would be nice if it went both left or right.  Because the arms don't collapse it's a bit bulky to transport in a gear bag but its positive clamping offsets that issue. I've seen some with folding arms that have dropped IPads suddenly because something came loose.  Where I fell down was not ordering the K and M clamp arm that comes as a package under a different order number.  I've since seen that arm in use and it would improve the versatility of this unit, though the package is pretty spendy. I could not order that arm separately.  I mounted this holder onto a short mic stand by using two mic stand quick releases - one for the holder and one for the mic stand boom arm. Then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag."
902,126,2.0,"It is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand. I would prefer more tilt, but it serves the purpose. It's Also harder to use your iPad without holding it and having an arm rest. Very durable and light weight. If I had to do it over again, I would use a music stand instead. Someday I may use it on stage. It's made in Germany, so it could be taken into battle."
525,126,4.0,"This holder is rigid, well built, rugged and works great at what it does...holding my iPad2.  I play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app, metronome and other apps and having this hold my iPad so I can adjust it and see it clearly where I want it is nice.  Great product, highly recommend."
49,126,4.0,"I had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy, so i wanted something that would grip the iPad.  this stand does the trick.  I don't have to worry anymore about my iPad falling off of the stand.  Some people have said that it's not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position.  I have not found that to be true.  Since I've had the stand, I have never droped the iPad out of it.  A lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic.  Because of the way that I stand with my guitar, it's hard for me to see the thing when I use the clamp kind.  This one uses the Mic clip treads and because it's on it's own stand, I can put it anywhere, at any height and see the iPad.  The only drawback is, you can't have your iPad in a case.  Or you have to find a case that's ultra thin.  Otherwise it's great!"
820,92,4.0,This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box.  I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal.  What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal.  When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal.  I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo.  This has the most distortion.  It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock.  It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with. It is solidly built and apprears road worthy.  great pedal and great value. I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product
536,92,3.0,"Great clone of a much more expensive Crunch Box pedal.  True bypass.  Knobs and switch are sturdy.  Great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels.  This is a Marshall type distortion (more mids, less scooped).  No Brutalzzz - there are better pedals to cop the scooped 5150 or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing, but you can get close with the right amp EQ and this thing dimed.  I agree with another reviewer- this thing has a very high output- so be forewarned the first time you plug in.  Unity is around 8 o'clock on the level knob.  It gets thumbs up for the sound/price ratio.  If you don't mind a longer shipping time, these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web.  This was my fourth Joyo pedal and I believe Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of price/quality."
511,92,4.0,"This Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion pedal is just amazing! My son has become a fairly decent guitar player over the past year and is moving beyond the basics, so was thrilled to get his hands on this distortion pedal. It was great to hear him play ""Iron Man"" through this pedal, it made a huge difference.The pedal produces a rich sound that has a nice sustain and tweaks easily with the three adjustment knobs (Gain, Volume, and Tone). This is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse. At the loudest settings there is a bit of ""hiss"", but it is easy to find where it starts and dial it back a bit.Highly Recommended!CFHEvaluation unit provided by manufacturer."
1030,92,4.0,"not bla bla bla, this joyo pedals are the best, any you get. that's it! thank u joyo im your number 1 customer."
985,92,3.0,"Good:  Plenty of gain on hand.  Lots of sustain!This thing can get really loud.  It gives yourinexpensive tube amp that Marshall crunch.Built well, it's casing is made out of metal, not plastic.Inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing 3 times as much.  If you're lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal, forget the Boss DS-1 andget this one!  Well worth the money.Bad:  Adds a little noise & hiss specially to single coils (strats & teles).You might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise.Quieter with humbuckers but hums when I use it with my Xotic EP Booster whichI always keep on.  It doesn't happen when I boost my overdrives (OCD & Hardwire CM-2).If you move farther away from your amp, the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise.  I guess this is typical for distortion boxes.No need to boost it though, it already has that thick & big sound to start with.It didn't come with a 9V battery as shipped, not a big deal 'cause I use a poweradapter anyway."
296,92,4.0,"I really like this one as a pre to my Fender Superchamp X2 head, especially on the distortion channel.  It really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones... the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a HUGE sweeping circuit.  I was not able to get it even close to 1/2 way without it being just ugly, but that might be preference.  Also of note is that I ran my Fender Mustang bass guitar through this (active pickups) and I loved the grit that it gave the sound.  This is a great pedal for the $$ and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand.  Very nice work Joyo, I will be buying more of your pedals for sure."
1224,92,4.0,"This pedal is amazing. It is a very good sounding distortion pedal, seems to be very sturdy and the price is absolutely unbeatable. For $30 there is no reason not to try it. You won't be disappointed if you do!"
241,92,4.0,"this pedal ...i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin...wow, it cranks,..!..it really will produce marshall plexi tones....especially noticeable in the lower registers...on the E and A strings...if you want a marshall  stack sound , this is it,,,if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions, so you can chose any amp sound you need,,,really people, for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make...and they all are super,,!"
945,92,4.0,"I've been very happy with all of my Joyo pedal's I've gotten, but I really love this one.  I use it with a crate amp with a tube pre-amp on the clean channel with my strat and it sounds great."
1162,92,4.0,"A bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews.  Plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see.  It has tons of gain on tap, it responds well to the guitars volume knob, it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love.The pedal cuts through and is articulate.  It's not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock.  Think AC/DC and Van Halen to Metallica.  It's a classic rock pedal that screams!!!Buy it."
285,92,4.0,This pedal is very easy to use!  Retro sound is rich with harmonics- does have the Marshall sound- very satisfied!
22,92,4.0,"According to the ad copy, this pedal ""replicates Full-Stack Marshall crunch.""As the other reviewers will testify, it does indeed do just that.What I'm loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like.  Dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up.  Its responsive to your picking attack, its distortion is very very harmonically rich, and it does give you a Marshall type sound, good boost in the mids and bass, giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for.Sad to say, it actually does the full-stack thing better than my ProCo Rat, which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal.  The Rat is fantastic and I have no plans to sell mine, don't get me wrong, but the Crunch Distortion can get the raging full-stack tones the Rat can, but has a tighter bottom end, less noise, and a more open sound than the Rat.  Individual notes ring out great on the Crunch Distortion.  Its a great pedal period.  Its a darn guitar miracle at $40.As a side point, I play lots of Ramones stuff and this pedal, more than any other, gives me that awesome Johnny Ramone tone.  I was running my gold-top with P-90's into this pedal, then into the sparkling clean '65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II (this pedal plays well with modeling amps, which is a rarity, let me tell you) and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone, better than I've ever got with my Rat, my Boss DS-1, DS-2, HM-2, ANYTHING else I've owned (and I've owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years).  This is the pedal that finally did it, it just nails that cranked 70's Marshall stack sound.My hat's off to Joyo.  They made a fantastic distortion, one of the very best I've ever played, and they're practically giving it away.  Buy one, you'll use it, you'll love it, you'll be happy you bought it."
179,92,3.0,i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from. there is no difference in the sound at all. this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box.it does 80's hair band and 80's metal very well.if you're looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic &#34;plexi&#34; or &#34;brown&#34; sound get the joyo british. it nails those sounds well.
320,92,3.0,"JCM800 in a 30 dollar box? Not quite.  You can't really get there without actual tubes being distorted.To me, its good for getting that kind of over the top, wild 80s midrangey Marshall sound.  To me though, it sounds too much like a pedal, and not enough like the real deal.  To me, the Hot Plexi sounds more ""real"", closer than this.  That being said, this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi.BUT, if you turn the tone down, and scoop your amps mids significantly (I'm talking about 2 of 10 on the knob, where 0 of 10 is too much and gives you ""Kill em all"" style hollowness that isn't good), it gives a nice dark, throaty, lower-mid rich tone that would be great for metal.  Yes, you're not supposed to scoop the mids on the amp, but this pedal is nothing but mids and scooping them tames the fizzyness.  So it's like Ghostbusters ....sometimes you just gotta cross the streams, and it works to filter out some of the harshness. I'm not even talking about Vintage Metallica scooped, its just scooped enough so it doesn't sound harsh in the high end and mids and sounds more like the Black Sabbath to Scandinavian metal tone I like to dial in (basically dark and dry, has a ton of mids but doesn't sound like Boston at all).I use it with a Marshall Class Five, pedal's tone at about 3 of 10.  Amps tone controls (Marshall Class 5 through a 4x12) at Bass 3, Mids 1 or 2, treble 6, set to headphone mode for a darker tone."
1157,92,3.0,"I've reviewed several Joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them...not just because of the price ($40 to $50), but also because of their (apparent) durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price.  But ultimately, I decided that this is somewhere between a 4* and 5* review, and I just can't give it the 5* review I've given the other Joyo products I've tried out thus far.* Extremely high output and high sustain *When I first plugged this thing in, I had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal I would try out with my Les Paul and VOX combo amp - with the dials all at 12 o'clock (50%).  Big mistake.  This pedal has an EXTREMELY high output.  Depending on the Gain setting, I was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the Volume set at around 25%.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it's certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder (a frequent criticism of the BOSS DS-1), but it's something to be aware of.Also, I read several comments here that this ""isn't a high gain distortion"".  I couldn't disagree more.  This thing has TONS of gain.  I think people are thrown off by two things: (1) The name, which pays tribute to the MI Audio Crunchbox it clones; and (2) The clarity/transparency of the tone, particularly the higher-end range, that shines through at all Gain levels.  ""Crunch"", in my mind, refers to a punchy, cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character.  The Crunch Distortion has a tone that doesn't really breakup or get ""fizzy"" as you turn up the Gain, but that's not what ""Gain"" really is.  The Gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note(s), but I think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesn't crack up.  Hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up.  This actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work, also, which is one of the JF-03's strengths.* The setup is weird, but workable *Because of everything I described above, you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want.  My level is usually around 25% to 40%, and is still very loud.  The ""crunchy"" classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist, but only at around 5% to 15% of the gain setting.  And I had the tone knob generally working from 9 o' clock to 12 o'clock, as it got a little too bright to go any higher.  (Again, this is with Les Paul humbuckers.)  Ultimately, what I decided was that this pedal has enough bass, not too much in the midrange, and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly.  If you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments, I'd imagine this pedal would do the trick!* It's costs less than half of many of it's true ""competitors"" *While the affordability aspect is distinct from ""quality"", it cannot be ignored.  Part of my initial disappointment was based on a side-by-side comparison with my MXR '78 Custom Badass Distortion.  The latter did have a fuller sound to it, and was arguably better for rhythm work.  But that's an $80 custom shop pedal from MXR.  Try comparing this pedal to a $40 Boss DS-1 or MXR Distortion + and it blows them out of the water (in my opinion).  I'm not sure want to roll with the Crunch Distortion being the only dirt box on my board, but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind (like a lead/gain boost), you could afford this and Joyo's excellent ""Ultimate Drive"" overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even BOSS distortion pedals go for.UPDATE - About a week into owning this pedal, I did revise this score from a 5* to a 4* rating.  If you graded the pedal in a ""vacuum"", I could absolutely see a 5* rating for the $40 price tag.  But ultimately, there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that I haven't had with other Joyo products, so the score should reflect that.  Please note also (which I didn't realize before) that the internal trim pot for ""presence"" is NOT easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it.  A distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment, and I have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything."
692,299,2.0,"So I agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid.However, I like to play at a substantially high volume for recording. To my surprise I hear radio noises. I tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards.  Sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications.this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money. It is just you do really get what you pay for"
820,299,4.0,"so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone.  I can not comment on this as I have never owned or played one.  What I can say with over 30 years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low price.I own this pedal, the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion. See my other reviews on these pedals. basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer. the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween.It is built solidly and looks roadworthy.  It has reasonably decent components and it sounds great.  Is it of the same caliber as a $150 boutique pedal - no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price.  I WOULD HAVE NO ISSUE GIGGING WITH THIS UNIT.  The distortion is warm with the tone at 12 with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available.  Lots of sounds in this unit.  And very very quiet.  Nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense.  Much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned.  For classic rock  this is perfect.  maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatOverall no concerns with this great product!"
536,299,4.0,"This pedal lives up to the hype. Distortion-wise, it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type OD and a full on distortion (like a Crunchbox or Rat).  I checked out several Youtube demonstrations before I took the plunge on this one.  I think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos - more transparent and organic sounding. I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly.  I also own a V1 Dano Cool Cat OD - which is an excellent OCD-ish pedal- but this one is getting more action these days.  I am running this into the front of either a Palomino V32 or a Jet City 20 watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup.  The pedal also plays well with others-  I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one.  The JF-02 is a really nice dirtbox - and not just for the price.  The fact that you can own it for 40 clams or less makes it a no-brainer for those of you who (like myself) are addicted to dirtboxes.  I have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here.  Shop around.  I knew the build quality was decent because I own the Joyo Vintage Overdrive and they are both built like bricks."
1055,299,2.0,"The price is great.The sound is good.The power jack, however, leaves a little to be desired.My standard Boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal 10x easier than any other pedal.I've now secured it with tape, so it should be ok.Based on other reviews, my guess is that I just got a dud and that most of them are okay."
1392,299,4.0,"This is supposed to be an Fulltone OCD clone, but to me, it sounds a bit better than the OCD, and worse.Has more low end and a smoother mid that the OCD. Thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the OCD, that may not be a good thing though, depending on your taste.If I turn the gain up past 9 o'clock, the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive, and kills the dynamics.Thats a good thing and bad, as I like a fuzz tone, but thats not what I bought the pedal for.Overall I can live with it, its well built, sounds good and the price is unbeatable."
927,299,3.0,"I needed a phaser, and saw that the Joyo Vintage Phaser was rated well, and super cheap, so I bought it.  I was EXTREMELY impressed with it, and did some further research into their pedals.  This was one of their top-rated pedals, so I figured I'd give it a go.  I have to say that I am fairy impressed!  I get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box - anything from a light fuzz to a vintage-style high gain.  You won't get a modern metal crunch from it, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  If you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the 70's and 80's, then this is a great bet.  This pedal is currently plugged in, and I suspect that I'll keep it as part of my rig (unless I happen to get rich and find a nicer, boutique pedal, or get around to modding my other pedals.)As a reference:  I own several Boss distortion/over drive pedals (Japanese DS-1, SD-1, OD-3 and MT-2.)  I The Joyo JF-02 and OD-3 are the two drive pedals that I have hooked up, since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that I currently own.A side-note for the tone-freaks:  The peddle does seem to be a bit muddy.  It's great for jamming out power chords, but not so articulate when you're arpeggiating chords. (Still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp.)"
296,299,4.0,"I really liked this one.  I bought the Crunch Distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone.  I very much like how Joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced ""boutique"" pedals.  I will continue to buy these products from Joyo until I find something wrong with them and at present I have nothing to bitch about at all here.  Sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound.  As an example, this is the JF-02 and JF-03 on guitar and the JF-03 on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a Line 6 Spider:[...]Buy this/these pedals and all things from Joyo, they are worth every penny."
578,299,3.0,this is a great pedal I would suggest it to anyone looking to get a pedal that would do overdrive and distortion it is a little more on the gain side and has a fizzy characteristic not to fuzzy however imo. Its fairly responsive too and the eq is opposite of say a tube screamers pronounced mids so rather flat eq. Plenty of volume and is a clone of the fulltone OCD if you want overdrive that doesn't sound like a tube screamer than this is for you. And botique quality at paupers price.true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo. P.s. crunch distortion is also an awesome pedal by joyo which does plexi tones well and is very crunchy.
1179,299,3.0,"I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good. It does. You have to try it to believe it. I don't like the demonic face on the front though, so I knocked off a star. Otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars."
781,299,4.0,"I have heard good things regarding this pedal so I was always interested, but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it. When a buddy of mine who happens to be a professional musician began talking about it, I said I think I'd better check this out.IM GLAD I DID!boys and girls time to break open the walletsgreat tone and drive within this little boxyou'll be adding it to the board just like I did"
1345,299,4.0,"JF-02:OMFG! No need to get all OCD about emptying your Full wallet to get the Tone needed! I tried this on Strats, an LP, & a Harrington, through my slightly modded VC5212(Webber speakers)tube amp; clean channel. No hum, noisiness,,built solid. The English instructions aren't really useful as the pedal itself is self-explanatory.I'm possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20+ years. I'll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens. There are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it. Your attitude and hands create the sound in the end. A pedal does not make you play better, practice does. If you are familiar with the OCD or can get one and a/b side by side it, you'll be amazed. Cool looking pedal box to boot."
385,299,4.0,"Like many others wanted the brand name pedal, drooled over it for years, just can't pull the trigger on a $130 pedal. Bought this instead and it plain rocks. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. This thing stands up nicely on all three. Using it with Am Sp Tele, Hiway 1 Strat, Squier 51, Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ, Peavey Classic 30/50. Sounds amazing in any combo. Using it as my gain along with the Joyo Vintage OD, for lead boosts. Killer set up."
367,299,4.0,"Just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes, it was worth giving this box a try. As someone else previously mentioned, set in a tube breakup setting , this device still is a little fuzzy. The tone, none the less, is very usable and sounds great. I'm a  happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well. Thanks for reading this."
179,299,0.0,50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless
1157,299,4.0,"Let's get a few things straight from the start - I love effects pedals.  I love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal (and have owned a few), and I'll also play the mass-produced BOSS and Ibanez stuff.  And if you put foreign/no-name brand in front of me, but the pedal is made well and sounds GOOD, I'll play that too.  All you need to know is that this pedal is well-constructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollars.Joyo is a Chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor (a heavy-duty metal box with an MXR-like button switcher), and then clones/mimics/copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from $100 to $250.  And they've figured out how to ship them to the U.S. and sell them for $40 to $60 each.  I've recently discovered these pedals, and if money/pedalboard space were no issue, there's probably 8 to 12 of them I'd like to own.The ""star"" of the Joyo lineup, however, is arguably the JF-02 Ultimate Drive.  This pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an American company bought them in bulk, repainted them, and tried to sell them for almost $200.  The fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the quality.The pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the Fulltone OCD Overdrive, a boutique pedal that came out several years ago, and usually sells from around $150.  I own that pedal, and I've done a side by side comparison on my pedal board.  And while tone is EXTREMELY subjective, I'm not sure that I wouldn't go with the Joyo Ultimate Drive in a blind test.  While the 3-knob, Lo/Hi switch are clearly inspired by the Fulltone OCD, the pedals actually sound quite different.  With the exact same settings, the Fulltone will actually sound much brighter.  That's really saying something because the Fulltone is known as having a very well-rounded tone with a defined base.  Well, the Ultimate Drive offers even more bass and mids, yet the Tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom end.It's actually extremely versatile.  I'm not sure that it would do low-gain ""crunch"" sounds very well, but if that's what you want, consider the Joyo Vintage Overdrive, the Joyo Crunch Distortion, or a Tubescreamer.  Right now, I have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great ""overdriven Marshall"" tone: The Fulltone, the Ultimate Drive, and the Marshall GV-2 Guv'nor.  While they are all great pedals, the Joyo really hits the sweet spot on my Vox Combo amp (using a Gibson Les Paul).As for soloing/lead play, I'm noticing all types of pick attack/harmonic response with the Joyo that I don't get with other stompboxes.  It really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel.  If you point all the knobs at 12 o' clock, some people may think it is muddy, but that Tone knob really does change the character quite a bit.  Sorry for the long rant, but I want people to know that just because you can't afford $150+ on a single pedal doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great overdrive stomp box.  Check the JF-02 out - it just might be your ""gateway drug"" to other Joyo pedals!"
1389,299,4.0,"Until today.  I do not own the Fulltone pedal that this product was designed to replicate, but you can search YouTube and see several comparisons and there is no audible difference.  Aside from that, this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit.  It's not a ""metal"" type distortion, but it nicely covers everything else.  I play an Ibanez Artcore through a Vox AC15 in a Christian band and set with just a small amount of drive, at about the 9:00 position, this pedal does not add color to your signal and the sound of your amp shines through nicely.  That's the whole point - the reason we choose a certain amp is because we like the way it sounds, so when we push it with an overdrive pedal we don't want it to change the sound of the amp, we simply want to kick it in the rump a little.  Or a lot.  And the Ultimate Drive does it nicely.  The drive could best be described as somewhat gritty and smooth at the same time, like sand in a smoothie.  Driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones.  But I think it sounds best with just a small amount of kick, right into a tube amp.  I'm not exactly bringing home tons of money, so it's nice to see that there are pedals designed to give great tone to even tightwads like myself.  The only thing that I could consider to be a downside is the stupid graphic of Satan, Darth Maul, Gene Simmons, or whatever that thing is that's painted on the metal case.  Other than that, if you're in the market for a ""boutique-style"" overdrive at about 1/3 the cost, you've found it. ONE FINAL NOTE: One unexpected benefit of this pedal is that the overdrive does wonders with a single-coil strat.  Really.  It gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone.  I can't think of any other pedals I've owned that could do this.  SECOND FINAL NOTE:  I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but I also played it through a cheap solid state Fender Frontman 25R and it sounded great even through that piece of rubbish.  As a Christian musician, I can say that this may not exactly qualify as a miracle, but it's pretty close."
1340,299,4.0,"Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed. Never owned an OCD but I don't need to. My neighbors I'm sure are not pleased. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! It's your guitar on steriods. Crisp deplication of it with bass, treble and a little hair on it. That's at the 25% gain setting. Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls. From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered."
551,299,4.0,"people say its an ocd clone.  it sounds very similar.  i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges, but its a very subtle thing.  all in all, i'm happy with it.  knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones.  good pedal to add."
1386,299,4.0,"I can't compare it (as others have done) with the OCD, but it simply gives me an overdrive that I love. I have several other OD pedals: Tube Screamer, LovePedal Kalamazoo and even a cheap Danelectro DS-1. The JF-02 is truly my favorite right now. I've been using it with a Strat and a Les Paul clone into either a Fender Vibro or a small Bugera V5. It serves up great tones into either one."
694,268,3.0,"You really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone, I was able to sort of dial in a nice Marshall '80s alt-rock sound, but when you're not playing it can have a noisy wind-like feedback coming from your amp; but it can vary from amp to amp. You can fiddle with the Voice and Drive knobs to clear it up, but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound. But to be perfectly honest, it's pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than $40."
866,268,3.0,"This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother. I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock. It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal. If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal, it is worth considering. The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal, which costs $189 (?). I don't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not."
367,268,1.0,"I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds. After trying for a couple of hours, I find that it won't do that. I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal. The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect). Nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( KDM Distributors) . They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country. But the pedal itself, not for me."
1384,268,4.0,This pedal solved my problem with my amp. After 13 years of messing about with my Mesa Boogie  realizing the the California sound is not what I truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a Marshall or VOX this pedal  has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a Marshall or VOX.  One can say all kinds of things about quality but for $31.00 it made me even more versatile. It needs to be in front of a tube amp...
889,268,4.0,"This one is easy - buy it! I've owned many effects over 32yrs playing . . . some ok, some didn't last 48 hours, others never parted with - this one fits in that category. Gives excellent range of Marshall emulated sounds"
1157,268,4.0,"I revised a previous 4-star review after playing with the Joyo British some more and especially after using it for direct line-in recording.  I now rate it at 5 stars.The phrase ""Marshall in a box"" gets thrown around a lot, but usually the people using it have a particular Marshall amp in mind.  For example, the Wampler Plexi-Drive sounds like an older Plexi, while a MI Audio Crunch Box will do that 80's JCM compressed high gain tone.  On the recommendations of several people, I picked up the Joyo British Sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different amps.Does the British Sound succeed at that goal?  Yes and no.  On certain settings, the British Sound does offer a convincing, tube-like sound reminiscent of a Marshall cabinet.  You can clean it up quite a bit, and it works very well as a ""foundation"" pedal, placed last in your effects chain to give the amp Marshall ""character"", but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedals.(Note: The pedal is actually its own preamp, so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp, or into a PA system or mixer directly.  You can use it in  the effects chain into another preamp, but that will diminish its effectiveness)But despite those good traits, there's just a few things ""off"" about it.  First, it seems to add quite a bit more noise (""hiss"") than some of the other Joyo Sound pedals.  Or perhaps it's just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a ""Marshall"", so i turned it up.  Second, as several other reviewers noted, the Voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be - turning clockwise makes it sound thinner.  On the other three Joyo Sound pedals, the opposite is true.  Functionally, this really should mean nothing, but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial in.If you read the manual for the Tech21 British (upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned), they claim that 9:00 on the Voice/Character knob would be JTM/Bluesbreaker territory, 12:00 would be Plexi, and anything above that gives you the ""presence boost of a 70's Metalface"".  I haven't tried all those amps, but perhaps it's meant to brighten up as you turn it up, and that's just a design choice.I think it's possible to get the ""Marshall"" tone you want out of this thing, but you have to work the EQ knobs with each adjustment of the Voice knob.  At this price, hard to complain too much."
76,64,3.0,"For a cheap pedal I gave this a try.  Very versitle.  Can get many different types of sounds and drive from it.  The knobs are a little tight, but that just makes feel tough I guess.  I like much more than the Joyo fuzz.  THis can give some cleans and drive to distortion.  You really need to work with it a bit with your amp and find that sweet spot.Certainly not the best overdrive, distortion, or effects pedal I have used.  But for the budget I do receomend it.  It is cheap and very has a good range of tone options.  I ran it into a Fender Camp 600 and they seemed to get along well.Hope this helps."
815,64,4.0,"Well built.Not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out.Has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect sound.Simple to use. Great variety of uses for it. I like the layout of controls as well.Only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it's on the right side,I'd prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals. Other then that nothing I'd change. Loyal Joyo pedal user. They've got a great product for the price point."
1345,64,4.0,"JF-15:again, OMFG! The MK type sounds take awhile to get, so tweak & consider your amp settings, guitar type, etc). The other pedals like it in the series I'm intrigued by, but I can get any sound I want so far with my stuff. I tried both the Joyo JF-02 Ultimate Drive OCD clone pedals individually on Strats, an LP, & a Harrington, through my slightly modded VC5212(Webber speakers)tube amp; clean channel. As with any pedal, it won't make you a better player. Only practicing, gear research & use, and your hands' touch/grip(whatever you kids call it these days)will have the final say of what comes out of the amp. I intentionally got the JF-02 after reading positive reviews all over the net. The JF-15 was a curiosity purchase. I was able to dial in sounds of Anthrax, Stryper, stratty Buddy Guy blues(remember he uses a metal finger tip clip at times-works with Pickboy metal picks), the 'dad friendly' radio rock sounds of Nickelback, Daughtry; Foo Fighters....to get your Marshall sounds takes a bit of work, but I use their Blues Breaker II reissue, Reflector and sometimes the crushing JackHammer(a BBII with more options and gain). I also use a digitech valve Hardwire for vintage 70's rock or switched to 'saturation' and mid scooped for the Pantera sounds. So, in closing, this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a Boogieish sound if you know what you're doing for the sound your leaning to."
268,64,4.0,this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board... constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough.. i like it with the power supply/no batteries to fuss with ... nice sound
1134,634,4.0,"Wow, I am very surprised by this pedal. I got it with the intention of going aft that chimey AC30 tone, which it does a decent job at. I didn't realize everything else this pedal can do. You can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem. Metal, no problem, crystal clear and punchy, no problem, super crispy tele twang, no problem.I tried it on bass and was REALLY impressed. It is eerily similar in function to my SANSAMP VT BASS pedal and gets a lovely SVT type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end. I even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added OD/Crunch in front of both my head/cab as well as VT BASS and PARA DRIVER. Works like a charm.Turn the VOICE control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy, while adding a bit of mid range response.I only wish this had a balanced XLR out in addition to the normal 1/4&#34; out. Phantom Power would be nice then also.I would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board, though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there.  I have been thinking of trying the Joyo DI wit speaker simulation for this purpose, but I just haven't gotten around to buying it yet.In my opinion you should at least check this thing out, I mean its $40"
1195,634,4.0,
241,634,4.0,"this pedal is terrific.,,,it is not a pedal to make you sound like an AC-30..the name is somewhat misleading...although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction....the real treat is the huge variety of boost, tone and gain you can dial in,.,,its mindbending....the gain is superb....not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer..,this pedal is an audio swiss army knife..."
116,634,4.0,"I love the sound of this pedal.  It's as versatile as can be.  If you want to sound like 5 Dimebag Darrels, then don't buy this pedal.  If you want a nice drive that is responsive, this is for you.  I employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortions/overdrives.  I have noticed the on off light is intermittent, but the pedal still effects the signal either way.  For a pedal that I have stomped on so many times, I'm not even the least bit concerned.  For an inexpensive unit, this thing rules."
1162,634,4.0,"I bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and I love it.  I use the pedal as a preamp going into a PA or poweramp.  The pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind.  I use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite.  It is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar.  I have a VFE Alpha Dog and an MXR Custom Badass OD before the pedal. After the pedal I use an MXR phase and Flanger, VFE Blueprint Delay and then a Byang Triverb.  When all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when I am not going through a more traditional amp rig.  Buy the pedal, it's great!"
1157,634,4.0,"I'm going this stompbox as I always do, based on the quality of the pedal and what it does - not necessarily whether than tone is ""useful"" for my particular setup.  Viewed in that objective light, the Joyo JF-13 AC Tone is an excellent pedal for $40 to $45.There are two ways to think of the JF-13 and the other ""Tech 21 clones"" in this line (California, American, British Sound, etc.).  The first is the obvious one, which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain.  This box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to ""clone"" a VOX AC30 amplifier into the speaker.  How effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self.  At the end of the day, if your amplifier (particularly the budget, solid state ones) has certain limitations that you don't like (too bright, not loud enough, too muddy, breaks up too easily...), no pedal (including a $200 boutique one) is going to fully overcome those deficiencies.But the second way to think of the JF-13 is as a preamp, where the output would go directly into a recording device, PA system, computer, or tablet.  I don't have enough experience trying that (though I did a little bit with the Joyo California) to say how well that works, but I've heard great examples of it online.  Also, having the convenience of amp-like controls (with 6 knobs) is certainly very convenient if you like to play/record in that manner.As for the sound of the pedal, it's very good.  I've heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up, but I wouldn't let that concern you.  That's true of virtually any distortion/overdrive pedal, it can be cleaned up with a noise gate/suppressor, and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low- and mid-gain settings anyway.  The ""Drive"" knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp.  It's a very nice tone, responds well to picking, and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume (which many pedal distortions do not do).  The ""Voice"" knob is hard to describe.  Basically, it morphs the tone into something deeper and ""punchier"" as you turn it up.  But that also changes the impact of all your other settings, including drive, EQ, and level.If I had one complaint about this pedal (even compared to the California, also a very cool pedal), I was a little surprised how much this pedal ""wants to be dirty"".  It's tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily.  But, again, I think part of that is you're basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo.  Check out some of the YouTube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder - it could be completely different in that context.  At any rate, it's a very intriguing device at only $40, and I could see finding new uses for it in the future I haven't envisioned yet.UPDATE (April 2013): I actually sold this pedal, instantly regretted it, and then bought it back.  Now that I understand how to use it properly (by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp, through the effects loop), I am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal.  It really is an excellent value, either as a ""foundation pedal"" or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a PA/Speaker system.  I won't be letting the AC Tone go this time :)"
294,634,4.0,"Let me start by saying... I used to work for Line 6, so I know modeling pedals!I have nearly every modeling pedal Line 6 makes,but I was looking to minimize the rig that I take with me to the bistro-size gigs that I play most of the time. In general, all I really want is the Vox AC30 tone and maybe a delay pedal or some other single effect. I use a very small ZT Lunchbox amp for this sort of thing and it's solid state, so you basically get a nice loud straight ahead tone, which is nice, but makes our cover tunes a little less 'authentic' sounding. I heard some sound samples online comparing this pedal to the Tech21 Liverpool pedal and to my ear...there wasn't a $150 difference. Very convincing and just $40! I pair this up with a Line 6 M9 and I can get most any tone I need for Beatles, Tom Petty and all of the 60's 70's tones I need. Love this pedal!"
726,634,3.0,"You won't get AC tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head.  but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp, this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your Amp.  Sorta like buying a Wah, flanger or other product, this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone.  Problem is is that you won't replicate a Vox sound found on a classic rock album, because what you are producing is a unique sound.  I have yet to try this through a loop."
1038,120,4.0,"I bought this to tune my 12-string without using the end jack. The headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough &#8220;feel&#8221; the tone of each string with only minor plucking.  I use it on Chromatic but it includes: Bass, Uke and Guitar too."
642,120,3.0,"Easy to use works as advertised, use it for my various stringed instruments. For the price I am very pleased."
714,120,4.0,I received the Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner in a very short time.  I know it will live up to the Finder name.  Very easy to use.
1272,120,3.0,Easy to use and the clip is sturdy. A bit slow compared to the Snarks I own but I like it.
299,120,4.0,"For a Fender licensed product, the build seems a bit on the cheap side, the plastic is kinda dollar store quality, but this tuner tunes very well, comparable to more expensive Korgs or Snarks. The screen is bright, and while it does not change color, the dial is easy to read. Buy a couple and leave one in your guitar case and another one in your car, so you can always tune up for those unexpected performances."
586,120,4.0,"I bought two of these. Small but well lighted screen. Very quick reaction to string. I liked it from the very first tuning. It is quicker and more responsive than other tuners I have that cost twice the price. It is small and doesn't look like a huge lump on the headstock.  Operates with one 3V 2032 Battery, included. I plan on buying a few more for other guitar cases and as gifts for my musician friends around birthdays and X-mas."
515,120,4.0,"5 stars because it works as its described, and has a nice display. I like this better than my old Snark. It's got a better build quality than the Snark for sure."
895,120,4.0,"super tight, and very accurate... i'm not a fenfer fan but I really love this tuner... I recommend this one to anyone..."
1323,120,4.0,"I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the ""ball joint"" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand."
982,120,4.0,"I have tried some others and was not to happy since they really did not tune the strings correctly (the sound was off slightly). This seems to be good for a &#34;quick tune&#34;, but like the pelal with cord plug in better. The pedal types are much bigger and you will have to carry more stuff out when going to a gig. This does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment."
106,120,3.0,"This is my first electric tuner.  As a percussionist-turned-bass-player, I goofed off, stick twirled and snored through countless hours of tuning in band class over the years. Not surprisingly, I kind of laughed at my own peril when it came time to tune my new instrument.  I grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed.  It does the trick.  It's small, accurate enough to get by with general practice (I can correct minor tuning issues by ear).  However, now that I have been using it for a few months, I have noticed that it does not give a very stable reading of pitch.  For example, if I go through and tune all the strings it will read a hair high/low on the next pass, and yet again on a third pass... If you need something &#34;no-fuss&#34; and accurate the first time around to the spot, you might want to invest in something a little more robust.  But, for standard/practice tuning, this is a fine accessory"
1423,120,4.0,Good tuners. Can tune several different instruments. Just be careful you have it set to the right instrument when you are tuning or you will go through a lot of strings. I have several of these. They are a great size and can be left on your instrument if you desire. Personally I prefer the Snark tuner but these are a fairly close second.
1205,120,3.0,"For a cheap tuner, this one is pretty good - it's about as accurate as the Snark, and not as delicate (the ball joint on the Snark makes it prone to breakage if you're not careful packing it in a case or gigbag).The display is large and bright.  I wouldn't use it to intonate an instrument, but for quick knockaround tuning, it's fine."
1231,120,4.0,"I have been using an app on my cell phone until I purchased this from Amazon.  This thing is awesome. It's so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it.  Oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound.  It does get a little sensitive when tuning, in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark.  But the more I use it, the better feel I get for it.  If you don't have one, get one."
1335,120,4.0,"This little guy worked just as advertised. It's a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont' feel like bringing it. It won't work the best for getting intonation right, but it hits regular tuning perfectly. Super easy to use and a must-have for anybody who gigs out."
383,120,4.0,"There are some more compact units out there (like planet waves), and the intellitouch PT10 is a little clearer to read, but this baby is great for the price. I leave it on my Strat while I play as it can be easily turned on/off as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock. The back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner. Overall, great deal for the price."
580,120,4.0,this is the most ergonomic tuner there is it functions well it is sturdy and it fits in ur pocket! count on fender to give u a good product!
104,120,4.0,"I bought two for 10 bucks each. They work great on my acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to see, and it centers quickly when tuning, without drifting all over the place. The only thing I would do to improve is add an off button. There is an ON button but the tuner will stay on as long as you are plucking/strumming strings. It will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing, but I usually start right into playing after tuning. The only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life. This is a great little tuner and I am glad I bought it."
1071,120,4.0,"Purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner. This is a great tuner IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR. With that being said, this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say. If that is what you are looking for, an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate. This little guy is best suited to practice (if you are like me and don't use your primary rig for at home practice and don't feel like breaking out the old pedal chain) it does the job and does it well. Now could you use it for a gig? Sure I suppose so, but bear in mind that it is not an ""in-line"" tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off. For the price it can't be beat. It swivels (although not much) but enough that you can clip it on, read the nicely lit LCD and tune up quickly. Great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar."
370,139,3.0,I liked the features this recorder has BUT it is a chore to figure out how to use them all.It let me know that I am not a techy. For me not so easy to get beyond the basics. It does a nice clean job for the recording I have gotten done.
693,139,4.0,"I debated between picking up this and the Zoom H4N and went with the Tascam &#8211; I just couldn't justify the extra $100 or so for the Zoom.  The unit is simple to use and the built-in microphones do a great job.  I picked it up because I wanted a portable unit that would let me use 1/8 inch, 1/4 inch, and XLR microphones with my DSLR, or capture great audio on its own.  This accomplishes all of that &#8211; although I need to use an adapter for 1/8 inch mics (for the 1/4 inch ports &#8211; there is no 1/8 inch mic port, which seems an odd omission.)The unit is almost entirely plastic, which can feel a bit inexpensive &#8211; I know that one selling point of the H4N is its sturdy construction.  Still, it seems well made and I think it's a fantastic recorder for the price."
340,139,4.0,"I've only spent a few hours with it, but so far, it is fantastic. I wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions, jams rehearsals and gigs, but I also wanted the option of just capturing a line source (such as from the DI on my bass amp). Bingo. Toss in the Dual Mode, overdub, phantom power, ability to run off USB power, and it is a total winner in my book. When you select the recording format and encoding or resolution (WAV + bit and resolution, MP3 + bit rate, etc)- each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card. I also love that it uses full size SD cards (microSD can be used with an adapter of course)- they're much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinky-nail sized micros. I'll update this review after I've had some more time with it."
213,139,3.0,"I purchased the DR-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs, and it accomplishes that very well.  The battery life is great, the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it, and the build quality is pretty solid.  My only issue is the internal mics, while crystal clear in terms of quality, can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things.  In addition, they are VERY susceptible to wind, even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air.  I highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery."
712,139,0.0,"Wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special.... But, I do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.Honestly, my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy!?

1198,139,4.0,"I bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project.  I can say that it worked amazingly well for this and did an excellent job at recording the bands without any distortion or excessive noise.  The recorder stores two files at the same time, one being a file at your chosen sensitivity and another safety track at a lower level in case there are any clipping issues with your main recording.  This accounts for quick transients or anything that might cause the recorder to overload and ensures that you will get a good take.The microphones can be folded out to extend the stereo field or in to tighten the field.  In addition, you can use external microphones or XLR inputs for professional-level input from the soundboard.  I found that the internal microphones did a wonderful job of reproducing the audience experience and I can't say enough good things about the performance.  This is an absolutely wonderful recorder.Bottom line: Highly recommended"
1397,139,4.0,"I recently purchased this recorder and have compared it to my older M-Audio Microtrak II. The Tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement. The internal mics are adjustable, the interface is easy to use, the battery life is long and the batteries are common AA and easy to replace on location.I've not tested the external xlr mic preamps but have recorded with the internal mics with absolutely wonder results. The internal preamp is very quiet, the mics on acoustic grand piano are very dynamic, produce excellent detail and have what appears to be a very wide neutral frequency response. The recorder produces a very wide and deep soundstage and does outclass my older recorder in every aspect. To me the price is very reasonable and the build quality is reasonable for the price. Highly recommended."

1414,806,4.0,"I am starting out learning to play guitar. I wanted a way to record myself playing guitar onto my laptop so I could go back and listen and to also play both lead and rhythm parts and mix them together.After asking a few questions on a message board, the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 was recommended to me. It's pricier than some of the options I was considering but given the reviews I figured it was worth taking a chance.I'm glad I did. The Scarlett 2i2 is a piece of cake to set up, even for a guy like me that's pretty PC savvy but never dealt with external recording devices.I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and everything installed flawlessly. The drivers loaded without a hitch and immediately recognized the Scarlett when I plugged it in.The included Ableton Live 8 Lite software recognized the unit as well.I'm looking forward to using the Scarlett more to improve my guitar playing. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase, even if it was a little more than I initially wanted to spend."
991,806,3.0,"Purchased to provide professional level I/O for recording from mixers etc.Works very well for that purpose; also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone(s). The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get, and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book. Inputs provide for microphone(phantom powered or not), instrument, balanced line on TRS, and balanced line on XLR connector.Tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed, and dead silent. Output of high quality material also sounds superb ... and compares well with other very high quality gear. Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this (crowded) price point.Though lacking lots of the I/O and routing options you get with more expensive units, this device, unlike most other products in this price range, has a quality feel to its enclosure, jacks and controls. Drives headphones, even inefficient ones, to satisfying levels cleanly.The input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too ""hot"" the color changes briefly to red -- helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering (in SW) to adjust your levels.Re computers and drivers: almost all the tests went well. On two laptops running Windows 7, installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great. One of these recorded perfectly also. The other, which has a core 2 duo processor (FWIW), had issues recording properly, and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed, and I tried them all, this problem remained. So, for certain windows laptops, you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout. This issue is why four starts rather than five.On a happier note this interface ""instantly worked"", with absolutely no installation, on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 12.04 ""precise"". So for linux users this may be a very attractive option.Lastly documentation and bundled software is ""light""; this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear - guidance re best practices etc.But this is a nit -- overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily."
587,806,3.0,"I'll start off by saying that I've had this interface for about 6 months now and it is still going strong. I think that anyone, especially the beginner, looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit. Not only does it provide 2 channels, but it also has monitor out and headphone out. This could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio.However, I have a few gripes with the 2i2. The headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it. This is purely the ""feel"" and does not really hinder performance. But it makes the unit feel cheap, at the controls. IMO, the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly. Moving on, while on the topic of knobs, the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators, but once again, aesthetics.Why 4 stars?The problem must of started happening today because I never noticed it before. Or it could be just that, maybe I never noticed it. Anyways, shortly after I engaged the 48v phantom power, the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing. Once again, this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away. I hope that this issue does not show up in all of the Scarlett 2i2 interfaces. I would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios. Hopefully, just my unit is defective and it isn't something that is common among the 2i2's.Another thing to note is that while Direct Monitoring is a feature on this unit, the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use. In other words, I am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record ""hotter"" and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor. Nevertheless, it is a feature that can be utilized though.So in the end, 4/5 stars! The packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic, but yet appealing, thumbs up for that. I really like the build quality of the interface and Focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit. The only issue that I would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged. Overall, great entry level interface/sound card!"
139,806,4.0,"This audio interface is fantastic. It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour you will have it mastered. The sound quality is great! The direct monitoring is a little quiet, but that is no complaint all things considered.All in all, if you need a budget system at home: get this. It is perfect for Mac or Pc."
888,806,4.0,And sounds crisp.  I had alesis io2 express which did a similar job.  But after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video I finally broke down.  I heard more definition with the guitar.  Now that I have it I take the quality for granted.  It has higher quality and the dials feel solid.  The little limiter lamp is awesome.  I'm very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job.  My old Alesis had midi pass through which didn't work anyway so feature for feature this is a better pick even if it's around 40 bucks more.
381,806,3.0,I've been using Ableton for 4 years and it never crashes. I connected this interface with LIve 9 on windows 8.1 i set my default playback and recording device as &#34;Line Out Scarlett 2i2 USB &#34; and set it as my default device. It crashes every time  in Ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on YouTube. Sometimes i hears pops and clicks after 5 minutes and have to reset the ASIO4ALL driver which is the same issue with my Audio Technica at2020 USB MIc.My computer is an AMD system and i have used my at2020(USB) on a Dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but. i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience.
837,806,4.0,"I'm using this unit to set up a Linux Digital Audio Workstation. It works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer. You will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device. Without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records 96kHz but skips when duplexed, I mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabled.The following settings are the best I've been able to manage in jackd2 without and xruns on a realtime kernel(using qjackctl) (I'm also no expert)Frames / Period: 128Sample Rate: 96000Periods / Buffer: 3Which gives a predicted latency of 4msWith a 10ft 1/4 inch patch cord (to run jack_iodelay) I got a consistent 8.24 ms overall latency (not bad imho).Without the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings, my computer is a sandy bridge pentium 2.2ghz with 6gb ram and a ssd.We have used this with an AT2020, AT2021. SM58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high. The preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions. Simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding. I've also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds (rain crickets) and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the house.Update:I've found the above setting in jack don't work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack. Here are the best setting I could come up withFrames/Period: 512Sample Rate: 48000Peiods/Buffer: 3RealtimeSoft ModeQjackctl lists the latency of 32ms but I have not tried measuring i with jack_iodelay.

695,806,4.0,"This little fellow is great. The proper connection from the Focusrite comes with the box. Hooks to the USB port on my MacBook Pro. Everything else plugs right in. No hassle with the right jacks and stuff. My headphone jack was a different size but I went from 1/8 to 1/4&#34; with a reducer I had on hand. I can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program. I've been recording using Garage Band. Works great. Anytime I can get a product that works as it's suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff, it's a 5 Star in my book. Oh. There are two ports for speakers on the back side I haven't used yet. Just trying to decide what speakers to purchase."
1056,806,4.0,"I bought this as an interface between my mixer, instruments, and mics to my Macbook for Garageband.  You have to go in and change the input and output in OSX, but it works great!"
308,806,2.0,"I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano.  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion.  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables.I purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202.  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs.  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables.  I'm glad I did.  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems.  This was a good purchase.  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer.  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well.  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers.  It's plug-and-play.I have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software).  I've tried using the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2.2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website.To let you know what I need in an interface:1. Balanced stereo in/out2. High quality headphone amp3. Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4. Good digital-to-analog conversion5. Low output latency (input latency not important to me)I don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device.================ The Good ====================This box is simple and well-designed.  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality.  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion.  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp.  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp.  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in).* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me.  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem.  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok.  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms.  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance.  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response.  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass.  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed.  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more.  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing.  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones.  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary.  Anyway, good headphone amp.  Check.* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR.  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping.  There's lots of gain available.  I have them turned all the way down almost.  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back.* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well.* The USB cable is just a type B port.  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever.  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable...king of annoying.* It's bus-powered.  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple.I really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware.===================== The Bad =========================The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP.  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver.  I mean, my computer is really stripped down.  Performance using the Behringer was good.  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible.Unfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency.  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms.  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy.  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that.I was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL.  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level.  I installed it and it worked.  The output latency was a tiny 4.3 ms (only .3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive).  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible.Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer.  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use.The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy.  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out.  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more.  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer.  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step. We are talking about major bugs here.I decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing.  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted.  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up.  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work.  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software.  At first it didn't work.  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time.I hope you are getting the idea.  These drivers are terrible.  Awful.  A monkey could have written a better driver.  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play.  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works.  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical.The good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them.  I'm hoping for that.  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2.2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2.1.================ Closing Thoughts =======================Unfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver.  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver.  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications.  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device.If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one...horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed. Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one. Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time.  Maybe it's better under mac.  I don't know.Interestingly, this is really the only USB 2.0 device in this range.  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around.  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1.1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time.  There's not enough throughput in USB 1.1.So in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok.  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software.  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec.  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future.Bottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device...if you can make the software work consistently.If you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020.  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers.  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one.================ Update May 2012 ==============A new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since the writing of the above.  The new driver actually works.  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency.  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer.  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok.  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i.e., gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now.  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update."
1426,806,4.0,"I write and record my own music.  When I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8 it wouldn't support my M-Audio Fast Track Pro so I had to upgrade.  The Focusrite Scarlett worked right out of the box.  I replaced the stock cable with a Monster cable and my recordings sound great.  Very easy to use.  Just plug in a microphone or guitar, set your levels, and start rocking."
283,806,4.0,Small amazing good quality interface. This is not the PreSonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable. I especially like the dual inputs on front. Back light on knobs shows clipping on volume (green and red) and connected (green).USB powered and plug and play. My Ableton Suite detected and connected in seconds.
1373,806,4.0,"For me being a solo 12 string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me. And you get the extra plugs ins supplied by Focusrite too with this interface. I cannot say I am wild about the included software which is Ableton Live Lite 8. I really disliked the screen views of Ableton and thought they were hard to view. So I did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested Mixcraft 6. WOW! I like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork. Mixcraft 6 is so user friendly and you don't have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it. You can be laying down and recording tracks in no time. And shouldn't recording be fun and not frustrating besides? The Focusrite Interface recognized Mixcraft 6 as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins. So all and all it turned out great and I am a happy camper. This in my opinion is one of the best entry level Recording Audio Interface units around. It also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power. Dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface. Engineered in England. And on the downside, made in China. (Isn't everything these days?)"
213,806,3.0,"I desperately needed a real audio interface, I was tired of my toy Behringer 1 i/o RCA usb thing.  After reading reviews online, this seemed like exactly what I needed.  It's small, lightweight, and fits nicely on my desk.  It's got some solid pre's, and has enough for me to work with.  I didn't need the extra i/o enough to break the bank, so 2i2 is all I wanted.  I'm really pleased with this, the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great.  It handles line and mic inputs just as well, and the general rule of thumb sticks here that ~70% (about 2-3 o'clock on these knobs) is a good base level for the pre's.  Phantom power works fine, and the direct monitoring switch is really useful.  I don't like dealing with latency in Ableton, so to be able to just monitor directly when I'm playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great.  And the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other...all in all I'd say the design of this is very user friendly.Some people reported driver issues with this, and I can't say I've really had any problems.  I'm using Windows, and I have to suggest using the ASIO drivers whenever possible.  I had some issues with iTunes where the audio would just stop and the level (in the Windows sound menu) was frozen at whatever had been playing.  All I had to do was disable and re-enable in the device, but that got kind of annoying.  I e-mailed Focusrite about it, and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me, but the problem kind of faded away so I never really figured out what that was.  I started using Fubar2000 because it supports ASIO, and I haven't had ANY issues with any program that uses an ASIO driver.  I have since started using iTunes again as well (still much easier to manage the library in there), and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then, so who knows."
919,806,3.0,"My only gripe is that once in a while after it's been on for a long time it seems to drop out / stop working in windows 7. I've tinkered with my usb power-save settings, etc, and it still seems to be an issue. Not that big of a deal as it doesn't do it when actively being used, but about once every other day I have to unplug the USB and reconnect it. Could be my system, could be the pre-amp, otherwise no complaints.Though be wise and download your drivers from the website, not the included software. I don't even know what is on the software but I think it's a full version behind what you'll find on the website."

1143,806,4.0,"I've used more than a handful of USB/Firewire interfaces over the past decade. In the past, it's always been a crapshoot, regardless of brand or reputation. Instability, incompatability, and frustration abound with audio interfaces. That being said, this has been the best interface I've ever owned.The size is fantastic, the preamps sound great, it has phantom power, it looks cool, and most importantly, it's been rock solid ever since I installed it two and a half months ago.I frequently leave my PC on 24 hours a day with this plugged in, and as of yet I haven't had a single crash, dropout, 'pop' etc. It's performed flawlessly since day one.Regarding sound quality, my recordings have never sounded better. I've used this to record electric guitar straight into the unit, acoustic guitar via condenser mics, dynamic mics, hammered dulcimer, cello, synth via direct input, and it handles it all flawlessly. I'm seriously impressed with the quality.Finally, it's small enough to take with me when I want to record at a friends house on my laptop.I've used it with Reaper, Sonar X1, Guitar Rig 5, Cubase LE, all without a hitch, on two PC's - Both Win 7 64-bit. The drivers gave me no hassle installing, and as I said above, ROCK SOLID.Your mileage may vary, as I stated earlier audio interfaces can be quite the crap shoot. Same setup, same hardware, etc, and one person can have wildly differing results. That being said, I would definitely recommend this unit, as it is my favorite of all time, and I've used everything from crappy firewire mixers to high-end MOTU interfaces.Great for the price, and if 2-in/2-out works for you, it should perform better than interfaces costing twice as much. It performs better than my old MOTU 828 mkII that I got for five hundred."
1404,806,0.0,"UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a ""low-headroom"" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed ""Ballsdogit!!!"", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer ""lock up"", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that ""you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.."", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should ""get something with more headroom like the 2i4."" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here."
656,692,4.0,I used this on my bass and I don't know what more you can say about it. It works and does at it is supposed to. I have no issues with quality or feel it's too loose.
1223,692,4.0,this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar. He has enjoy and likes using the capo.
1298,692,4.0,Arrived as expected and as described. Capo is well made and is very well priced. I am very happy with the purchase.
1218,692,3.0,"This one works, it can't make me play any better (wish it could) but it wont make me play any worse."
532,692,2.0,How far wrong can you go for $1.83? I can give these away to beginners that don't have a capo.If you really want a capo get a Keyser or other decent capo. They're only $20.
984,692,4.0,This item did the job it's made for. Made well and you need to make sure you open it fully prior to inserting it onto your guitar neck to keep it from snapping back on you because it's strong but it won't damage your guitar and it's effective.
482,692,4.0,"When I attached it to my guitar(s), I said, &#34;Wow, this beats it's more expensive competition! Does it hold? Yes. Does it damage your instrument? No. I'm going to get another one before they decide to raise the price!"
222,692,4.0,"Nice product, I like the great feel as the handle angle is large and makes it very easy to remove."
660,692,4.0,"I've got several capos, from the highest end models to the cheapest, and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones, with ease of use and solid build quality. Why spend more?? Just buy it, and stop over paying for your capos forever more!"
367,692,3.0,"nice item...works well...great price, no need to own one of the more expensive ones for the job it does. I have to type more... oops got enough typed :)"
153,692,4.0,"Not much you can say. The headline says it all. It works well. Shipping takes time but for the price, who cares. If you need it now, go local but if you have time to wait, this is perfect. I ordered two just in case. But it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all."
1125,608,3.0,My old cable was stiff and unruly. This one is not so stiff and is very well built. Buy it.
53,608,4.0,"Is a nice cable,,god quality  as always with the Fender brand... Guys if you need a cable that are not high budget,, and a god quality this is the cable...."
239,608,4.0,"This cable arrived today and I am still in shock! It's truly amazing. The best BY FAR patch cable I have EVER used, or even seen in 25 years of guitar playin.HUGE value! Buy one now!"
140,608,4.0,"This amp cable is perfect.  It fits my need for practicing.  It's just the right length for sitting on the couch, strumming daily.  I would like this one for each amp I own so I'm not always taking it from amp to amp.  I will buy some more of these.The cable also looks nice and completes the Fender look.  I would highly recommend this and give it a no-brainer 5 star rating.  I have nothing negative to say about this."
1230,608,4.0,Very durable cables ... I've used them all. Fenders aren't bad. I have used these without any problems whatsoever! See for yourself!
972,608,4.0,as expected for a beginner. I'm just learning what I want and what I need. This cable works fine for my needs right now.
885,608,4.0,Fender 1A-SX2S-JTXK 10-Feet Performance Series Guitar Cable ig good Stereo cable for guitar or keybord.It's long enought. I recommend it
236,608,2.0,Even though it is Fender it was made in China I would have thought the US.  What can you say about a guitar chord?
356,608,4.0,"If you need a cord and don't want to pay a lot, this is a good one.  I was surprised howsturdy it appears. The only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine."
584,608,3.0,Very nice cable but the white ends (which are nice looking) could be a little shorter.  It works awesomely and it's not a bad price for name brand cables.
36,608,4.0,"Nice looking,nice sound and quality to these cables.They are what I needed!Thank You GO-DPS for making such good quality products."
698,608,4.0,Delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a Fender product.
184,608,4.0,"Got this for my electric guitar. Does its job just fine and the white tips look quite nice, a truly great product!"
193,608,4.0,These Fender 10 foot Guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buck!Every part of these cables are quality.
266,608,4.0,"This is a Very nice cable, I like this one better than all the other ones that I Own, Its thick and the sound is great. Then one day an Amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off, That stunk"
409,619,4.0,"I seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i've been playing guitar for like 5 years. These picks are the BOMB!, + they don't break on you when you strum too hard/fast :D, i would rate this product 6 stars if i could i'm completely satisfied with these picks!Tip: These picks are great for HIGH ACTION/HIGH GAIN GUITAR SOLO'S."
467,619,4.0,"I play bass with these and they have a unique tone.  The scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music.  Makes Rotosound strings really sound off.  I have not found that they are so hard on strings that the strings were out from use rather than the picks.  It does take a bit of use to get good with them, but it is worth it for when you need that really growling tone."
734,619,2.0,while the product is everything it said it would be.  I was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin. it does whats is supposed to so I cant fault it in that way it. just was not what I was hoping for.
377,619,2.0,"These are a little course for what I wanted. Brass is a lot better, and the edges are too sharp for fast picking. They may be giving the strings a little premature wear, and the loss of tonality is the problem. There are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm."
1317,619,3.0,The picks are good. They are a little flimsey but are ok. The best thing about them is the look
424,619,4.0,"At first I thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous, but after actually trying one - I love it. It has really helped me deliever that Fatal Blow...I can honestly say, this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out. Not to mention that it's hard to strum and sounds awful.What these picks are good for is leads. Rock, Metal, Shredding and even Country. The sound is short with a very high tone pitch. Switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull. One plus is, while recording I do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking (shredding) as I did with a plastic pick.I still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound, but love these picks when things heat up. Also, I'd like to add that even though I can play Rock You Like A Hurricane by the Scorpions - it never sounds quite right. Until Now. Using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound.Also, these picks have a no-slip grip. With the Fender facing your fingers, there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it's very easy to grip and use. It feels funny at first, but I got use to it really quick.I can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience..."
277,619,4.0,"I was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy (or thick) guitar pick.  I saw this and had to try it.  They are very solid, don't bend, and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar.  Haven't tried them yet on an electric, but they should be great there, too.  You need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action (not a surprise!).  But the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat.  Anyway, these are great guitar picks if you're looking for something solid and long-lasting."
388,147,4.0,I've found no issues with noise or build quality so far; the 1 foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their input/outputs in weird places.
15,147,3.0,"I bought these because I needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board.  I have the Planet Waves patch cords called 6&#34; so I thought these would cover it being 12&#34;.  When I went to hook up, they were still too short so I immediately blamed these cords.  OOOOOPS, took out the tape measure so I could complain and found that these are indeed 12&#34;  I then measured the Planet Waves and found they were actually 10&#34;, not 6&#34;.  My bad!  These seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are.  If you want to spice up your board, go for some color!"
536,147,4.0,"At this price, these cables are a bargain.  The jury is still out on how durable they are, but they all arrived in working order and have held up well despite several months of plugging and unplugging.  The length is great for when you have a bunch of pedals with inputs that vary from top to side.  I hate it when the patch isn't long enough and I have to mis-allign my pedals !  Anyway, thumbs up.  Will revisit my review if they begin to fail soon-"
888,147,4.0,I've used this to connect several devices and the colors help. I would recommend this and the quality is good.
1392,147,4.0,"Good quality, seem durable enough. Sure there are better cables out there, but for the price, these are hard to beat."
804,147,3.0,"This is a simple and cheap way to hook your pedals together on your board. I have bought 2 packs of these and have only had one go bad on me. note that they are cheap and are NOT the quality of, say, George L's cables. That being said, they also don't cost $70. Can I hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones??? Not really. People who say they hear tonal loss with some cords are scrutinizing the imagined auditory experience. Why only four stars??? because I wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors. it does look dorky on your board to have a bunch of different colored cords. but, that's my opinion."
200,147,3.0,"When I look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables, so bright and festive, I just FEEL beautiful all over again."
889,147,2.0,"If you want to pay $$$ for patch cables and it somehow makes you feel more secure, go for it. Otherwise pick these up - great price and certainly gets the job done. The colors fit may into your rig or perhaps you can use them strategically, that feature is in incidental plus. They appear to be solid and will likely last just fine."
1142,147,4.0,"These are great cables for connecting effects pedals and I love that they have a little color (both for fun & better organization). To top it all off, the price is right. Cheers."
18,247,4.0,"I bought this to add into the Axess MP1504-BLK Professional Dual Wireless Microphone I bought for home Karaoke use for my kids 6 and under. The microphone could not pick-up voice until it is about an inch close to your mouth. When you have it close to your mouth, it does sounds well enough that my kids enjoy. I added this screen to protect the microphone from getting damage or wet when it falls or when my kids touches the microphone to their mouth. Since this package came with 5 screen, I can wash it when it gets dirty and use the reserve to always have a clean microphone for my kids.The quality of the screen is very good. I believe that it can withstand abuse and will be able to handle frequent wash without ruining the material."
1273,247,4.0,There is not much you can say about these other than they fit my Behringer ULTRAVOICE XM1800S just fine.  I don't sound to muffled with them on either - the colors made my Podcasting team bicker over who was getting which one.  I won't hold it against these Windscreens.
507,247,3.0,"The product is here and I am glad the size is right. The colors punch out nice and will1. Help my vocal mics last longer so singers don't drool on my mics.and2. Help out during soundcheck. &#34;Hey, can we get blue turned down a little?&#34;Products were intact but on an quick examination I saw small tears in the foam. I will update if that matters in the long run."
231,503,3.0,"I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price, I might as well give it a try. This thing works great. There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar. The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board. I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well. Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to, otherwise you'll get some rattling noise from the strings. Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it, it works very fast when you need to change keys."
470,503,4.0,It does the job.  Easy to get on and off.  Seems to be sturdy and well built. Best of all the price!
824,503,3.0,"The capo looks nice and works without any problem.  You can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff.  But the build is solid, and it looks like it will last for a long time."
844,503,4.0,"This is not my only capo, but it's my cheapest.  It works as well as other more expensive ones.  This one was a good deal through Amazon.com."
171,553,4.0,"I was looking for a decent capo, found this, and have been using for months without a problem. Cheap and works great, would recommend to any guitarist."
741,553,4.0,"Cheap, quick and easy. It serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive it's almost painful. I haven't had it break and it doesn't cause any issues with the instrument, so I'm more than content with this handy, inexpensive capo."
370,553,3.0,When just starting out one purchases equipment carefully. This capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there. Even a professional would appreciate this capo.
589,553,4.0,"It seems like such simple concept, but so many companies cannot get it right. It's just a spring and a handle, but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brand.This one worked very well for me and at this price, I am able to have a couple extra lying around."
18,553,4.0,This is a good quality Capo. The built is similar to the ones I see at the local music stores that sells between $9 - $14. I guess they are all made by the same company and then stamped with a logo by whoever is selling it. This capo does not have any logo or stamp but it works just as good as the more expensive ones.I ordered two of this item on 03/18. Expected delivery is between April 11 - 18 as the product will be shipped from Hong Kong but I received the product on April 2nd.I used it in Acoustic Guitar and on the Ukelele without any problem.
369,553,4.0,I have used these and I noticed this capo is a cut above the rest. It snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away. I do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off. I would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts.
584,553,4.0,I guess 5 stars because it 100% does what it's supposed to and doesn't cost much. The width of the grip gives you more leverage which can make it easier to clamp with someone with weak hands. That being said that person probably isn't playing much guitar.
795,553,4.0,"Works really well, was a great price, and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time. The capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar."
430,553,4.0,"Good quick change capo, strong enough so far"
958,553,4.0,"For 3 dollars this is a great quality capo, it works perfectly don't waste your money on a Planet Waves or Dunlop or whatever, save 10 bucks and buy this"
390,553,3.0,This is a pretty good non-expensive capo. You can spend more but this does what you need it to do.
201,553,2.0,Got these because I wanted some extra capos around.  They work fine and are a great price - they do seem to be a little hard to open (spring seems a little tight).  Good deal as back-up capos.
787,553,4.0,It was my favorite capo. Someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment. Had to buy another one.
899,249,4.0,The Capo is made of metal and works well. It does what it is suppose to do. I would buy this again.
928,249,3.0,"A bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo, but well made. I don't think that you would go wrong!"
694,249,3.0,"This obviously is trying to copy the Kyser brand capo, and it does it pretty well. Feels a bit cheaper, which it actually is both monetary and quality wise. The cardboard insert in the package even has the &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34; but no info on where to mail it; and that's pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect, but other than that, it's a good cheap capo."
991,212,4.0,"Purchased for hanging two rock-band pseudo guitars. Works great for that and for uke. Would also be OK with guitars.The nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar-like instrument within reason. The packaging is very basic - you just get the product, with no fasteners or instructions.The hanger looks good, is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments. When solidly mounted, the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments - though I did not test that.For the cost these are a smoking deal. The alternatives I purchased for my music room & heavy bass guitars cost about 2x more and are not necessarily any better functionally.As mentioned there is no included hardware, but that is a non-issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall-board fasteners, depending on your situation and weight of your instrument. So just plan on visiting the hardware store if you don't already have these in your shop. I used wall-board hangers for one, direct screws into joist for the other, as it happens."
932,212,3.0,This is thus far a good bargain. I have used it to hang a 12 heavy string. The arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt. No chance of falling. There are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal.
1408,212,4.0,I hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it's really sturdy. I can't say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that's the point. I'll use a stand if I'm going to use a guitar often. I had a 230lb drummer fall into the wall where I had these baby's hung up and not one fell or almost fell.
878,212,4.0,a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item  i bough for my primo and he really loves it!
807,212,4.0,"I have a couple of old guitars I couldn't bear to part with, but seldom used.  (Ah, memories!)  I keep my everyday guitars on stands so that it is easier to practice, but these add charm to my music room/office and they work great.  The &#34;fingers&#34; will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly."
787,212,4.0,I bought this for my acoustic. Bought another one for my electric Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6. Holds my bass guitars easily as well.
779,7,4.0,This is the best tuner I've used in over a decade of playing various instruments. The design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on.  Overall ease of tuning and ability to do so in a noisy environment are well worth the $14 I paid.I like the ability to change the overall tuning to different standards [e.g. Baroque or NY Philharmonic] and the included metronome is also nice to have. Perhaps the most useful feature is that this unit will tune any note; guitar players can spot check a fretted tone and other musicians can tune to C or another preferred note that some guitar tuners do not have.Mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit. There is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke. Glue and a rubber band now holds it together. I mention this so that you won't put yours in a tight exterior pocket on a gig bag or otherwise smash it into a broken state.
1186,7,4.0,"I own a red, blue, and now a black one. This one is the best yet. Very easy to read."
221,7,1.0,"This isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a ""ripoff"". However, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim. When it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner. However almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. I try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. It also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find. I don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner. A cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find REAL, full sized, affordable batteries for it..."
766,7,4.0,we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner. I used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly.
1302,7,4.0,"Ive used this on Guitars acoustic and electric, Ukuleles, Banjos, Banjo Ukeleles, Violins, and mandolins.  no issues... well except that sometimes it rattles (quietly), it doesn't effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar.  That Just means i take it off most of the time after i tune.  That's not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the Tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time, and I hate how that looks anyway.  I love the little thing.  My only complaint is that (like all other clip on tuners that i've had) it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally, and will then wear out the battery."
1221,7,4.0,"Having to send the first Snark SN-8 back, but the replacement, thus far, has been flawless.I made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on.A couple tips to tuning a guitar: tune it like you play it. If you strum & play softly, then pluck & tune each string softly.However, most people don't play softly, so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes: they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out, & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins ""softly"" resonating.So, in essence, what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat.To tune your guitar correctly, you really ought to pluck each string hard, like every 2 seconds and tune it that way - rather than waiting for the sound to fade out. If you do it this way, you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of it!Also, please check your intonation. Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings. You pluck your open string (hard) & tune as described above. Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY (with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK), on the same string, but 12th fret - and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT same.If they are off (12TH & open), then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment. Please don't pay someone to setup your guitar! You can do it yourself so easily. Go on u toob and search ""scott grove tuning your guitar wrong"" and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3,000 guitars - & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details. Also, watch his video on how to setup: adjust intonation, truss rod, action, etc.Btw, if you can't get your Snark to tune your guitar: hint - it's not the tuner's fault. The first 3 saddles (e, b, g) should look like a staircase going down. Then, your next 3 strings (d,  a, e) should also look like another staircase going down. If not, break out your philips head & tweak your intonation."
10,7,4.0,"I love this little tuner.  It's better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar, and as accurate (and easier to use) than the one on my VOX Tonelab ST.I'm planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case."
1015,7,4.0,"I really love this little tuner, I just keep it on the headstock of my guitar when playing & just touch up tuning if needed. Best tunerI have owned for the price.R. Joyner"
725,7,3.0,This is the new and improved Snark. The display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright. I found with other models that the display faded and was not renewed even with a new a battery. The only downside to this one is that the bars on the display are so thick that the string has to be more out of tune before it shows up on the screen. So the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens. However the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws.
500,7,4.0,"It's a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost. The fact that it looks like it's made out of Bat Armor is a huge plus. For a clip-on, you can't beat the accuracy this little unit gives you."
1090,7,4.0,I had the red Snark and a couple others. This one is the best ive tried so far. No problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning. 6 stars if they had it that high.
108,7,4.0,"It's hard to find a good clip-on tuner that's accurate and visible in all situations. The Snark SN-8(B) is my favorite so far.  It's really bright, more accurate that other Snarks, and (despite other reviews saying it breaks easily) I've found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is.  Again, it's a clip-on tuner so don't expect razor-sharp accuracy.  But it does a good enough job for what it is.  It's quick and convenient.  If you need something more accurate I recommend investing in a good pedal.  I've found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display.  I don't typically use the metronome feature, but it's nice to have it.  Overall, my favorite Snark model and my favorite clip-on tuner."
644,7,4.0,"Not only are they inexpensive, but they hold up very well. I have a ton because I keep one on the end of each guitar. Furthermore, they are very accurate as well. SO worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time I want to change tunings.Bottom line: Inexpensive, well-made, accurate, time-saving. Buy it now."
359,7,4.0,I have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong.  I use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric.  Great design.  I cant see how they could improve this at all.
137,7,4.0,"Wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.So far, works well.Sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. Can tune up quickly every time."
1105,7,3.0,"I love the Snark tuners but don't know that I'd call it super tight or faster than the older SN-2. I feel the display is an improvement - easy on the eyes. Hopefully, more reliable than SN-2. I've had pixels dropping out on one SN-2 that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine. Too soon to tell if the SN-8 will hang in there.I don't see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an SG. Don't know why as it works fine with acoustics and Strat. Response time on the SG is longer than the older SN-2 model but, I haven't yet tried to understand what's going on with it. Have't tried it on bass yet but, I know that the SN-2 didn't play well with the E string open. No big deal, I just tune it at 12th fret. Could choose any note since it's chromatic. Speaking of which, playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the Snark. Tune any string to match the song and then, tune the other strings with the same displayed error.Bottom line is that it's a great tuner and it's not likely that I'll get much use out of the old Korg tuner that once balanced on my knee."
1285,7,4.0,"This guitar tuner is simply AMAZING!!! I feel like I should have paid at least 50 bucks for this thing, but $13 is practically a freaking steal! The display is so nice, the quality is amazon, and this thing is beyond accurate! Never using another tuner again in my life. SNARK forever!"
1177,7,4.0,"This tuner works great! I am not able to vouch for accuracy, who but the best tone person can?"
577,7,4.0,"This is one great piece of equipment. Even on an unplugged electric guitar, just clamp it on the end of the guitar, and it picks up vibration for tuning easily, and tunes spot-on. Adding to that is it's convenient small size, and being unbelievably cheap price. Why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job?"
12,7,4.0,"This thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning.  It has many features I have yet to utilize, but good to know they are there if needed."
985,7,4.0,"I don't play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as Hardwire HT-6, Polytune or Korg Pitchblack.  I researched for other alternatives and decided on a ""clip on"" tuner.  I narrowed it down to 3 - Korg AW2, Snark SN-1 & Intelli IMT-900.  All 3 have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under $20.  I visited each manufacturers' website for more information and found out about the Snark SN-8.  Snark claims that it's their best tuner yet.  If their SN-1 can go toe to toe with the others, then I would assume that their best will do even better.  I took the plunge and ordered one.  I have only 2 requirements for a tuner:1.  It should be accurate.2.  It should be fast.The Snark SN-8 delivered on both counts and more!  It came with other extras like ""tap tempo metronome"", ""super tight tuning"", ""pitch calibration"", ""transpose features"" etc.  I may not have any use for all of them right now but it's nice to have them at your fingertips.  You can use it for other instruments as well but I only use it for my guitars.  The SN-8 is small & unobtrusive.  The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like.  After tuning, I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case.  I don't like it hanging in my guitar!  Of course, it doesn't stay long because it tunes fast!  For under $20, these little tuner is all you need.....fast and accurate.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."
1056,7,4.0,"I own at least 8 of these.  I use them on all of my instruments, including banjo, mandolin, guitar, and Ukelele.  For the price, they cannot be beat, and they leave a small footprint too."
117,7,3.0,"I have reviewed this before.  I like it, works really well.  I have a Lever Harp with 26 strings so I really needed something that would help me keep it well tuned.  One  hint from our son who also has one,  be careful when you &#34;twist&#34; the head, he broke the first one and had to buy another one.  I am very careful How I adjust and have had no problems."
269,7,4.0,"I love these tuners.  I have tried the intel, krog, boss, etc... and out of all of them, I like the Snark the best.  Response and visual display are awesome.  Unlike a couple of the others I've used, the Snark works well on any place on the headstock.  A couple of the other brands I had to be careful where I positioned them because they didn't respond well.  You can't go wrong with any Snark."
263,7,2.0,These tuners just seem OK to me.  I still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner.  The accuracy in my opinion just isn't there.  Still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing.  The price is right.
340,7,2.0,"Edit: I've had to downgrade my star rating a bit, so I've revised my review- full explanation below, but in short, this just doesn't work as well for me as the SN-1.Background- I have the original SN-1 as well, and have had it for a couple years. The ball socket on the back of the tuning head broke fairly quickly when I forgot to remove it from the headstock before putting it in the gig bag (Protec Contego semi-rigid hybrid case with a little more room around the headstock than your average padded bag). I rigged a repair that has worked OK, but figured a replacement was in order. However other than the broken socket, this has been one of the best tuners I've ever used. Very quick and intuitive. Bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions. Fast response on all strings, including the low B on several five string basses. Despite what I feel is a weakness in the design (the fragile socket), I still felt so good about the functionality of the product that I ordered another, this time the SN-8(B) ""Super Tight"" tuner. I decided to go with another model in the hopes that a newer model might be a little better reinforced at the ball sockets (hence the ""super tight"", perhaps?).Out of the box, the SN-8 is almost identical to the original, save for the obvious color differences. Then clamp appears the same and doesn't seem to have any greater clamping force that I could detect. Turning it on though, the display is quite different. Basically, it is much more ""to the point"". The indicator bars either side of the center pitch (""in-tune"", dead center) are much wider and fewer, meaning a less granular and less precise display, but one that is very easy to read at a glance in any light. This could be a mixed blessing, but the up side is it is brighter, simpler, and potentially quicker for on the fly tuning. The downside is it is not granular enough to say, intonate an instrument's bridge. It also seems to respond much quicker, which I am realizing is also mixed blessing, and here we have the missing star. The speed also means it responds really quickly to all input, meaning it seems to want to constantly change the note it is sensing. It seems much more twitchy than the sn-1. Unless you are able to mute every other string fully, it will jump between notes frequently. This is also one of my (many) complaints about the Planet Waves Mini-Headstock Tuner too.  I've found that attempting to tune with loud background music or other instruments blasting through a PA will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies - even if I successfully mute all other strings, making tuning with the SN-8 that much more difficult. The differences here between the SN-8 and SN-1 are quite noticeable. For that reason, I just ordered another SN-1.I can't say how this tuner would work for other instruments, as I am a bass player. I'm not sure there is or isn't a defect or flaw here, perhaps it just didn't live up to my expectations (set high by my awesome experience with the original). Simply put, my sampling size is too small to say for sure or proclaim this a bad product.  All I know is that it just isn't working very well for me. If I saved the packaging for this one, I may consider sending it back in exchange for a second SN-1 or perhaps another model. If not, it'll probably be the one I hand others when they want to borrow my tuner ;)"
132,7,4.0,"I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right. I think I'll be putting one of these on most instruments from now on."
914,7,4.0,"I love this thing.  It quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument I own (electric & acoustic guitars, electric & acoustic bass guitars).  It clips on securely, is easy to see, stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on & off.  From the front, you can barely notice it at all.  I just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed.  When I switch to another instrument I un-clip it and take it with me to what ever I want to play next.I love this thing.  Love it, love it love it!"
646,7,3.0,"I've been playing long enough to remember when &#34;small&#34; electronic tuners were the size of a paperback book and had prices approaching $100.  New tuners like the Snark SN-8(B) are a joy in comparison.  The display is good sized and easy read (without my reading glasses) and the tuner responds quickly and accurately.  The only complaint I've heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight.  Yeah?  So?  It won't fall off while you're using it (or playing) and you shouldn't leave anything clamped to your guitar when you aren't using it anyway.  You can't beat the price for a tuner this easy to use and it comes with a cleaning/carrying bag too.  I've used it with standard and altered tunings on guitar, bass, banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and tipple.  This one works.One suggestion for any younglings reading this: take it from an old f*** - electronic tuners are great, especially for tuning back stage or in other places where it isn't quiet but please, do yourself a favor, and learn to tune by ear.  I've met too many young players that cannot tune a guitar without an electronic tuner.  If the battery dies they are tone deaf.  Trust me, the ability to tune by ear is a skill you will always use.  If a string goes sharp or flat while I'm playing I can tune it back without stopping.  I would not be able to do that if I hadn't learned to tune by ear."
35,7,2.0,"No, this tuner is NOT super tight. It's ok, but not super tight. I bought this because the tuner in the RP1000 is pretty sloppy. Based on owning this for a couple of weeks, I would say that it is just about as sloppy as the RP1000. I will use it on stage, but for recording I will stick to the app on my phone. Oh yeah, I almost forgot -- when you register the tuner you get a PDF download of ""Secret Chords The Pro's Don't Know"". It's good for a laugh.Pros: Bright easy to read display, fast response timeCons: Nowhere near what I would call super tight.Bottom line: Save your bread and get something else if you need a tight tuning. I would suggest the Snark SN-1. It's cheaper and works very well!"
1317,7,4.0,This is very accurate and also very easy to use. The led is easy to see in well lite area as well as dark area. I loved the price.
1316,7,3.0,"I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years.  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the ""rubber feet"" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc.  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently."
627,7,4.0,Love this little tuner. I have several reds and several blues and this one seem to be about the same except the displays seems to be more accurate.
410,7,4.0,"The Snark SN-8(B)Super Tight All Instrument Tuner is the best Snark tuner I've purchased, of 4 models. This SN-8, has a matte type finish, not glossy, it has a gun metal black look to me which I prefer to the glossy finished models. The dial, is easy to read, the bars on the dial are bold. All Snark Tuners are a great value, they function as well as any brand."
1019,7,0.0,"I have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think I'd learn after one).  They calibrate okay , it's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way).  To me, for the price, it's made cheaply.  Try D'Addario instead; love their tuners."
660,7,4.0,"If your looking for a great, fast and accurate tuner for your guitar or bass, this is the one for you. It is easy to see in light or dark venues, has great build quality, and helps to tune your instrument in record time. I don't go anywhere without it, it may well be the last tuner you'll ever need.Flaws are few. The battery life could be better and it wont work with acoustics(no built in mic), but then you know that before you buy it, so you cant really complain. It would just be nice if it included one is all.All told, if you need a great tuner, look no further, this is one of the best, especially for the price paid. Why are you still reading this?? Buy it already ;-)"
1318,7,4.0,"This clip on tuner by Snark is fantastic, works great!  It alows you to fine tune each string.  Buy it!"
429,7,3.0,"This is the third Snark tuner (the others were Snark II) I have bought. Both of the others broke where the stem joins the clock-type display (could be glued together, but irritating). This one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable. Why buy this after the experience of the others? Well they are very good and easy to use tuners, and for not much money (my guitar strings cost more!). This one has a great display - full colour and easy to read. I use it on a guitar, a bass and a 12 string and it works well on all of them."
1328,7,4.0,"A i'm very impress with the precition of this tuner. It's very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar. (even using a capo) 100% recommended.Battery is included also, so you can use it right out the box."
125,7,3.0,"The display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle.  Maybe I'm using it wrong but Ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs.  But from there it works great,just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a  good angle."
855,7,4.0,"Easy, accurate and, best of all, it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing. I've tried other brands and they don't swivel correctly."
201,7,4.0,The Snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat!  Great tuner.  I got about three of them!
921,7,4.0,"I had to get used to this tuner at first.  I have used a different brand up until this purchase.  An experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me.  Glad he did, the price is way affordable on this site and it's really easy to use!"
141,7,4.0,I clipped it on the neck (head) of my acoustic guitarIt tunes up well and is very easy to readI turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingI have not used it enough to test the battery lifeBut so far so good. Great for the price.All Pros and No Cons so far
839,7,4.0,"Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little. I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners. It clips onto the guitar easily, stays put, and is not intrusive by weight or size. The bars are easy to see and are accurate."
164,7,4.0,I personally use this in conjunction with my TU-3 on the ground but honestly it just gets a read faster than the TU sometimes and it's a fraction of the cost. Really efficient way to go in my opinion. I am a pit orchestra musician and I've lent it to people who play LOTS of different instruments and it really tends to work well with all of them.
488,7,4.0,"Great tuners, Ive had the snark 1s i think (the blue ones) and they were really good the rubber part always fell off. It is too early to tell if this will last longer but so far so good"
554,7,4.0,"This is the newer version of the original Snarks. I have bought the red, blue and older black models. These are great. Fast and reliable, and accurate. This new ""Super Tight"" is a bit faster and is slightly more accurate than the others, but the older units are still excellent. The display is a little brighter, but I think the battery life is a little less than the originals. I can't recommend these enough."
1265,7,4.0,"This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly, and I've enjoyed using it.  It does its job, and it's well worth the money."
1403,7,4.0,"For $13, its hard to say anything bad about this gadget. It's accurate in any sound environment, easy to read in any light, very portable, and will tune any stringed instrument. The visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that's a silly extra that doesn't interfere with anything so no problem."
1121,7,4.0,"This is hands-down the best tuner I've *ever* owned. The Snark SN8 works extremely well, and being chromatic, works on every stringed instrument I own (guitar, bass, banjo, violin) no matter what key the instrument is tuned to. I still use my Korg Pitchblack inline with my bass (also a very nice product), but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong. This little baby is amazingly easy to use, and always accurate. It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle (just as it should be - I've personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners). It simply does its job and does it very well.Also, buying this item from Amazon saved me quite a bit over the local Guitar Center, which is always a big plus. It feels tough too, this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around, which is a very good thing. Despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping, the product arrived intact, and fast. I would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in. Fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition (no thanks to that paper envelope - seriously, they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something).I could not be happier, at least until I buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag."
784,7,4.0,"I bought this for a friend who's previous tuner was lost. I have to say... I've been so impressed by how easy this is to read, that I'll probably buy one for myself now.Other than a great display and accurate tuning... this is made with a move-able arm between the tuner and the clip. The arm is a dual ball joint and allows you to configure this is any position you'd like.I wasn't expecting it to be this nice. Very cool!"
1048,7,3.0,I used it about twice and so far it is a good product I also use it to check sync with my other tuners
671,7,4.0,"I would say as long as you dont try to use this as a floorjack, it will work just fine for you. I dont wrench the arm around like all star wrestling and it appears to work fine for me. I love the way it sits right on top of the headstock and you can tune instantly. Nice and bright, easy to see.  Had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars. Remember its a guitar tuner, not an impact wrench."
1264,7,4.0,I read some mixed reviews about the unit but I&#8217;ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine. Seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price.
719,605,4.0,"I've tried so many other strings over the years just to see if I was missing something. I wasn't. There's something about the feel and tone of Ernie Ball Regular Slinkys that I absolutely love. My local music store has 3 for the price of 2 deal on strings, which is a nice deal; however, this deal is a little sweeter. If you can wait for the delivery, it's a no brainer."
1368,605,4.0,"Something about EB Strings, they really are ""slinky"" - whatever that means. They have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better.  Plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands."
844,605,4.0,"I've been using these strings on all my guitars, electric and acoustic, since the mid-70s.  I've tried many others, but always come back to Ernie Balls.  They tune better and they keep the ""new strings"" sound longer and that's the main plus, but they just ""feel"" good.  I play and practice a lot and I abuse strings...these can take it and come back for more!"
374,605,4.0,"I recently got myself a Kenny Wayne Shepherd Stratocaster guitar, I decided that since the guitar he had a set of tens strings installed I would go with these.They work flawlessly.The qualities excellent cannot go wrong with Ernie Ball strings no matter what gauge you get."
1122,455,3.0,I got this for our church. I got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall. They where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly.
885,455,4.0,"Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair is a good deal for musician. Buy it, if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to."
1277,455,4.0,I'm happy with them. SO much easier having my guitars in a stand i can grab when I want. These stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced.
364,455,4.0,very happy. Holds my lies Paul and schechter guitars very well. Had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened.
8,455,3.0,Cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far. I've taken them from new jersey to south carolina
1270,455,3.0,"I bought a couple of these two years ago. They are a sturdy but lightweight stand. The small footprint is nice for those with limited space. I use for both electric and acoustic guitars. I will say that the two I recently purchased are NOT the same as the ones purchased in 2011. The pictured product is the same but the actual product is not. The newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model. The tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support. The body support now inserts through the base tube; the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece. The rubber feet are also smaller. These changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable, however I believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars. I didn't notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported. There may be a concern about damage to certain finish. I would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material."
1192,455,4.0,I needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass. These things work really great. I love them.
54,272,4.0,"I'll echo what others have said: this is a superbly built instrument for the price, and I don't know how Epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively. It looks, feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much.A few notes: what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &#34;Vintage&#34; model is actually a super-rich deep, deep mahogany/maroon color, and it's unbelievably beautiful.As others have said, the factory-supplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them, you'll be disappointed. Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele, and restring it as soon as you get it.I was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my $60 Kala soprano uke--normally, one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder, fuller sound. But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all-acoustic ukulele, and that probably accounts for the quieter tone. I think it's a *better* tone, and I'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness, so I'm happy with it. If I wanted stadium-filling volume, I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall amps.Oh, I almost forgot one important note to all owners: IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID, UGLY PICK GUARD! Since ukulele players rarely use picks, and when we do, we use soft rubber or felt ones, there's no need to protect the finish from scratching, and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument's looks.I applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes, and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails--no sharp tools! It came off pretty cleanly, leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue. I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton, without any damage to the luscious ultra-glossy lacquer finish. And the ukulele looks SO much better now! If you feel as I do, feel free to do likewise. Just remember the key words: SLOW and GENTLE. Don't force anything, and you should be fine."
847,272,4.0,"Upon arrival, I was astonished. With a box as monstrous as the one this little number arrived in, I was expecting a ukulele made for Andre the Giant.It's not quite as big as the packaging leads one to believe but the sound sure is!The unplugged tone is warm and sweet, like the most delightful brownie you could ever imagine. Plugged in it really shines. I paired mine with a Pignose 7-100 for street performing and, while it is a bit too chilly to play for nickels at the moment, I have no doubt this will pay for itself in the long run.I was slightly surprised at how slim the body is (similar in scale to an actual Les Paul), as I was expecting a fuller body but it doesn't hurt the playability a bit.The finish is gorgeous and the little stick-on pickguard is just too adorable for words.If you're hemming and hawing over getting one, just do it. You'll be oh so pleasantly surprised."
567,272,4.0,"I recently purchased this ukulele from a local Guitar Center. When i first got there i was looking at the Lanikai brand, but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that I felt like a strong wind could tear it apart. Then I saw this one. It has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range. I have already learned the basic chords and can't wait to become proficient with this instrument."
1174,272,3.0,"I enjoy playing this thing so much. It's reasonably quiet acoustically, but it shines when plugged in. Plus is looks good - the actual color and finish are quite rich and shiny, respectively.It stays in tune (after string break-in) and the intonation is ok - not spot on but definitely good enough. The tuners are basic, but they work well. It is thinner than a normal uke, about half the body depth. I find holding it without a strap to be harder than a normal sized uke, but with a strap it's very comfortable.Mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket. The bag itself is also pretty basic, but good enough for what it is - a bag to hold your uke and some misc. items"
612,272,4.0,"This is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds! Change the strings immediately, and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument.  Amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too!Only drawback - there is no volume control on the instrument itself.The amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about, and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal - BUT, it's all about the instrument, and I give that a 5."
462,272,2.0,"The action was a little high for my taste.  The strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible. Why do they sell an instrument with crap strings? That is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument.  Otherwise it's well built and works.  Really it's a three and a half star IMO, it's not as nice sounding or as playable as my Mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings."
1023,272,4.0,"My wife was worried about what to get me for Christmas, I really didn't want anything (other than the Harley I have been asking for for 25 years, maybe next???) and while surfing Amazon I came across this Les Paul. I had to laugh since it looks so much like my Gibson Les Paul, kind of like a ""Mini Me"" version.Well I have never heard of a Les Paul Uke and did not think for $99 that it would be much...but the reviews were telling a different story. So I found my Christmas present at last for ""the man who has everything"" (it is true, my wife told me...still hoping for that Harley though). I ordered it a few days before Christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife's dismay...but I printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway. Well Christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing (the Uke, not the Harley), but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when I opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby Les Paul!I figured since I was taking my fellow Amazonian's word I better order some Aquila Ukulele Strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the Uke are junk(and they are, shame of Epiphone) which I did, the Uke arrived about 4 days before the strings but I attempted to learn how to play it anyway.....OUCH those stock strings were rough on the fingers, and the sound left much to be desired so I waited until the new string were installed prior to this review.Wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument, it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers. I just love it now!!!!So if you decide to get one of these Mini Me Les Paul's do yourself a favor and get.......A set if Aqila stringsAquila USA Aquila Concert Ukulele StringsA Snark Uke Tuner SN-6Snark SN-6 Ukulele TunerA nice leather guitar strapFender Plain Leather Guitar Strap With Fender Logo, BlackandA Daily Ukulele Song Book by Jumpin JimThe Daily Ukulele: 365 Songs for Better Living  [DAILY UKULELE] [Paperback]You will love all of these items I am sure.When it arrives be sure to practice ""Billie Jean"" played by Jim Hill...see it on YouTube...it is a riot![...]orJake Shimabukuro Bohemian Rhapsody[...]Enjoy!"
50,272,4.0,"I really don't see how Gibson can make and sell these for $99!  The tech at the guitar shop can't see how either.  I plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects.  I was really surprised to see how well they sounded.  I'm not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy/experiment for me.  If you are really into electric sound, I recommend going the guitar route.  If you just want to play around a little, this uke will do."
55,272,4.0,"* SHIPPING.  The Epiphone comes wrapped in  protective foam, inside a gig bag, which is inside a sturdy standard tri-shaped box, which is itself shipped inside a HUGE box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic.  That huge box is then inside yet ANOTHER huge box.  Honestly, to protect this better they'd have had to contact Tony Stark.  It would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping.  EXCELLENT job.  5 stars on that alone.* SIZE. Overall length 24"".  Fretboard 10"".  Nut to bridge 15"".  So good overall medium-size.  I like that it's a bit larger than a 20-21"" soprano uke.  It is ""concert"" size (which I greatly prefer over soprano.  Frankly, I'd like to see a baritone version).  The 24"" length is an excellent size for both adult and youth / child fingers.* QUALITY.  From stern to port, this instrument shines.  Beautifully lacquered flawless finish, protective edging, plastic finger-guard (which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic), solid neck screw-joined to heavy-wood body.  The whole unit is heavy-wood and very durable.  Nevertheless the sound is quite good.  The tuners are acceptable quality (nothing amazing, but they work well).  The frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes.  The amp-jack is chrome-metal back-plated to the body; it's NOT coming loose.  Strap holders are already mounted, saving users the hassle.  And of course, the impressive EPIPHONE and LES PAUL signature stamps on the head for sheer class.* SOUND.  I found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box, despite the fact it's pretty solid-wood electric (I expected it to sound dull.  It doesn't.)  But I still bought a set of d'Addario strings (a brand I've loved for years) and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added.* ACTION. I've rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception. The action is fairly high (not uncommon with off-the-shelf instruments).  One will need to remove the strings (keep them for emergency spares), file down the bridge bottom (easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper) and add a new set of quality strings.  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to action (as are most players I know), so this will be tweaked.* DURABILITY.  It's very durable.  That counts for the gig bag too.  No cheap ""tent nylon"" there-- but thick nylon that will really resist tearing.  As others mentioned I'd still look for a decent hard case; they average under $40.  A good instrument is worth protecting.  But I'd say this could take some real punishment and still play well-- not that I'd go bashing it against a stage floor.  That would be goofy.* WEIRD SUGGESTION:  Hang on to the box it comes in.  It makes a great temporary ""hard shell"" case. It's made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke.  Great for hauling around in your car if you can't shell out for a shell. Seriously... that is some stiff cardboard.  Protects well.  : )* ELECTRONICS.  The sound is clear. Sadly there is no volume/tone control, no battery to preamp, and thus the signal to the amp was quite low.  They could have done better on that end.  But wow, at this price how can one gripe?Two solutions to this:1) Open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better (including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible).  That's the tricky way.2) Put a preamp on this. You can buy one here on Amazon for about 15 bucks. If you have a mini-mixer you can do the same thing with that.  Even with that little extra expense you'll come out ahead.Aside from the passive electronics... this is a PRIME instrument.  It is a mid-size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano (if you're careful and don't tune it too quickly) or a baritone (guitar 4th - 1st string, E-high), depending on the strings you choose.Considering what you get for the price... I don't think this can be beat.  Unfortunately, my extra-long fingers find this very difficult to play... something I didn't consider when ordering a uke.  But that's a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument.  The product itself is excellent."
1227,522,4.0,This is a great deal for two microphone stands.  They are well constructed and are very flexible; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand.  Several adjustment areas allow the perfect height/positioning.  These should last a long time as long as they're not abused.
239,522,4.0,"These are solid, good build quality and really do get the job done well.Easily adjustable, versatile in design and function, get em!"
895,522,4.0,"I bought these as back up stands and now use them all the time, they perform just as good as the better stands and I liked the 2 pack value... Nice..."
564,522,3.0,"This microphone stand it a fairly good buy.  Because it is a light and portable stand, it is not built to be fully extended with microphones, such as the Behringer XM1800S.  Adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone.  I found that I needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended.  As it stands, I would suggest this as a fairly good deal."
706,522,4.0,"Received these with lightining speed! They came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up. Alot of adjustments to these, and they actually adjusted high enough for me at 6'5"" to be able to sing at Lemmy's angle! Great for singing, micing amps and such. These are 39.99 each at a local music store so....Update: These are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer's mic, but if you grab it with some enthusiasm, the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand. I used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that. I still say they are good for the price, just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen."
1391,522,4.0,"I expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had.  To be honest, I'm not missing anything.  They have all the features and versatility you'll ever need.  Perfect for what I want to do.  They even come with a clamp for your cable."
302,522,2.0,"Some of the stands I have purchased are hollow, some are solid (at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand). The hollow ones are a PITA because they are easier to strip and bend. All mic stand inventories I have bought from (budget lines) have this issue. I wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box."
677,522,1.0,"I know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here.  The unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a RODE M1 mic or similar.I knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but I opened one, tried to use it and can't. It was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it.  I suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose.  Again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands."
661,522,0.0,"The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately.  Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand.  They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay I guess.  But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk."
1158,522,4.0,I got these recently. A local Music shop was wanting $80 per stand so couldn&#8217;t believe the price of these. Was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised. Great quality an very robust.
1142,522,4.0,"I didn't know when I ordered these mic stands that they were On Stage stands. They are fully adjustable, great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics. Excellent quality. I'm very happy with this set."
899,218,4.0,I wanted P-90 pickups. They do make noise kind of like an old album. Once you start playing you don't notice it though. Other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on. It looks really good!
452,218,4.0,"I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar.  I have learned a few songs, but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar.  I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap.  I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago.  The Fender and the Dean's were very nice.  I thought the Dean's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender.  This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well.  I couldn't figure out the different tunings on it though.  It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle.  I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal.  The other one's must be for some special type of music.  But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean's.  It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean's I have found.  The Dean's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus.  But this is a very nice beginner's guitar if your just looking to get started.  I would stay away from those Fender knockoff's and stuff like that and get this guitar.  I also got the cheap Rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great, plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes.  All in all, a very nice bargain."
385,218,4.0,"As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different. I love Fenders especially telecasters (I love the simplicity of two pickups, two knobs, and a p-up selector). I wanted something with P-90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late. You can get a lot more for your money these days.I pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P-90 by Epi and have been really impressed. I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet, I can't really think of anything to change.Pros - Simple, TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through, Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel. Sounds KILLER through my tube amps (Peavey Classic 30 and 50, Fender Blues Jr.), lightweight, stays in tune, cheap price (not afraid to take it out to a gig, not afraid to have it stolen, let my kids play it, etc.), comfortable neck profile.Cons - Cheap tuners (but stay in tune), cheap electronics (wiring), some frets are long and sharp (my high E string gets caught under the 14th/15th fret - I haven't filed it yet), messy job at nut and fret board.All in all, this is a great guitar for a great price. I still plan on modding it, but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections. My upgrades, if any, will be new pots, caps, wiring, nut, perhaps tuners. No need to replace these pickups. You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this. At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrument.As a bit of a guitar snob (love my US Fenders) this guitar is getting a lot of action. I say this one just may be a keeper."
100,218,1.0,"Big disappointment. I've been so impressed by Epiphone's but this one didn't do it. Quality of manufacture and assembly great. Pickups far less than inspiring. Yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those P90 sound. I may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. Just didn't have the tone and bite I was expecting.I could certainly invest in some PUP's but I have too many great P90 guitars to bother. Roll of the dice I guess."
457,218,4.0,"I have spent a good month with my new guitar, and I am impressed. The pickups don't suck, the potentiometers are surprisingly good, the tuners are not very good, but I can live with them. The fretwork was second to none, absolutely the best fretwork I've seen in a guitar under $500. The 60's neck profile is very fast and comfortable, and it's a satin finished neck and body (unfinished fretboard). It's also not a very heavy guitar (considering that it's a mahogany body and neck). My main issue with this guitar is that the wraparound bridge/tailpiece breaks wound strings easily. I have gone through 4 6th, and 2 5th strings in the single month I have owned this guitar. Upgrade it to something better. Your strings will thank you. Oh, and (this goes without saying) UPGRADE THE STOCK STRINGS!"
585,269,4.0,"These were just what I needed.  Over the years, some of the bridge pins on my 12-Sttring Acoustic Guitar have broken and had to be replaced.  Some of them had the white dot, some didn't, therefore, they didn't look uniform.  With these pins, the guitar now looks like it did when I bought it.  Thank You. James Edward(BAT)Owens"
1267,269,4.0,"I just recieved these in the mail today, and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar! Not much else to describe, they're fairly simple to use, and they're selling you 12 of them, so I have a spare set now! My original pegs were also white, on an all black guitar, so I'm totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar. I definitely recommend these for anyone that needs/wants black pegs for their acoustic, or acoustic/electric gutiar."
1216,269,3.0,"Good for the price, but  If you can spend a few dollars more, I would recommend the graph tech ones."
551,269,3.0,"they did the job.  they're plastic.  they didn't cost much.  fit my 12 string with no problems.  they aren't bone, brass, wood, pearl, don't expect them to be."
419,217,4.0,I love this tuner! Its awesome to use and efficient! The only thing I wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are. To my ear it sounds good but you never know???
1204,217,4.0,"this tuner works great.  it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning.  I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well.  a great investment unless you have a perfect ear."
404,217,3.0,"I purchased two Fender instruments, a mandolin and an acoustic guitar, each of which came with a Fender clamp-on tuner with similar functionality, but I thought to give the Snark a try. I haven't used the sound versus vibration mode much, nor have I done much with the metronome function much--I can't speak to them; however, I am very pleased with the vibration tuning. Compared to the Fender, both will get your strings tuned well; what I like better about the Snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers. With the Fender, I feel I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again, and that adds up when moving from string to string.  The Snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag; the trade-off is any easy-to-read display. Lately, it's become my go-to tuner."
217,217,4.0,"This is not just a tuner - its a peacekeeper for our band.  Arguing over tuning can really take up time.  It works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached!  I do kind of miss the fights over who's in tune and who's flat, though.  Excellent product, though the metronome is of no value, but that's not important.  We use it for guitars, violins, violas, cello, bass guitar, voice training, and ordering pizza (who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill)."
608,183,4.0,"A great little amplifier.  Good quality, good built in effects, and is still easy to carry around.  I replaced the stock speaker with an Eminence Rajun Cajun, which has improved the tone and provided increased volume. The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs. I would highly recommend."
1066,183,4.0,I've been using this amp for a few months and I'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance. I was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on YouTube. I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly. The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it. I only use the clean side or input one. This is what Fender calls Blaceface Clean. No matter how hard you push that channel it won't break up and sounds great with no FX's running. I really haven't used channel two much. These are all your pre-sets which many amps are doing these days. I'm pretty much old school and like to find my own sound. However they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer. The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software. The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on... It's a loud 15 watts... I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems. If your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you can't go wrong with this guy. It's now my go to amp in the studio. You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one (how I run it) the sky is the limit. Haven't used the software that you need to download from Fender but will look at it later. right now this amp doesn't need to be tweaked for me...I loved it right out of the box! Give it a test drive and let your ears decide...
389,183,4.0,"This is the greatest practice amp ever.  And by practice I mean practicing by yourself and with a band.First, it's all tube, so it sounds really good.  It's gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes.  It also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast.Second, it's 15 watts and is pretty darn loud.  I've used it for band practice and it's definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer.  At a bar you'll probably need to mic it or use the included line-out.Third, if the 10&#34; speaker isn't loud enough, you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air, it sounds great in the 4x12 and 2x12 cabs I have.  That'll make it loud enough for most bars.Fourth, it has great sounding built in effects, nearly everything you'll need.  Most small tube amps don't have built in effects.  So if you're trying to practice down in the living room, you're forced to drag your effects with you.  That's annoying.  With this amp everything is built in.Fifth, unlike a lot of tube amps, this one gets very quiet.  You can turn it way down, keep the warm tone, and practice without bothering anyone else.Sixth, the price is amazing.  All tube, build in effects, and line and speaker out... wow.  Fender is basically giving these things away.I love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know.  The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch.  But considering the price, that's understandable. There's no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them.  You'll only want the cover and footswitch if you're playing in a band."
1397,183,4.0,"I picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised. The sound is very authentic as I have a 60's tube Champ in excellent working order for reference, as well as a Deville.This little amp has the classic Fender tube sound, with a broad, punchy tone and the right amount of compression. The included digital effects, (vibraphone, delay, reverb, chorus and tremolo) are all convincing and well executed.The modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ, tweed deluxe clean/dirty, baseman, 65 princeton clean/dirty, 65 deluxe clean/dirty, 65 twin and an array of british and metal amps.All and all, a super practice amp or mic-able performance amp. Great job Fender.PS - I don't review products that don't stand out as excellent."
130,324,4.0,"Lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.Can't ask for much more in a tuner."
168,324,4.0,"Wonderful tuner, I've used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all.  Incredibly easy to use, super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go.  Well worth the price!"
1094,324,4.0,I already had the other two Snarks and then I borrowed this version in a shop from another patron.  The readout is cool.  Makes me feel good inside to look at it.
918,324,4.0,"Will work on any instrument.  You don't need the expensive ones, this works just fine..just wish the batteries lasted longer!"
30,324,4.0,"For the money there isn't a better tuner on the market today.  This is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker, really?  This tuner is s[pot on every time and super fast.  You can move from string to string quick."
342,324,4.0,Let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide. the batterry that come with it lasts an average of 6 -9 months - A new battery will last over a year - I get replacements at local CVS - Savon store
327,324,4.0,"For me, the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used.It's not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down. In many cases, they jump around until, by the time they settle down, the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers. So, a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved.As far as the SN-8 is concerned...WRONG!I've found the SN-8 to, in fact, be Super Tight, BUT one has to insure that there isn't even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar.This is what I don't like about the other type of Snark display.  It's not symmetric!  It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green, and none of the yellow bars to be lit.  If the rad bars are illuminated constantly, how can you tell if the string is a hair flat?  When I'm on pitch I want *all* indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish.In that regard, the image shown here is wrong! It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow. Uhm...no.The SN-8 is Super Tight, has a touch metronome, and lets you set it down a few semi-tones if that's what floats your boat and, as they say on TV, ""All for an incredibly low price!""I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case.  At this price, I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way."
356,324,4.0,I have the Snark 2 but read that this was the best so far.  I got and agreethis works better.  I would recommend it to anyone.
109,324,4.0,"I have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it. I could never quite get the fine tune I was looking for, and I have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear. These little tuners are amazing. So easy to use, and portable, and cheap. I have several now, one for every guitar. Cheap is important, because they are made of plastic and I have had one break at the joint after a lot of use. I also received one without a battery, which upset me at the time. I am in Afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by. If you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money."
1405,324,3.0,"my only complaint is that it doesn't seem as accurate as some traditional tuners, but that's probably by design so you aren't fiddling over fractions of a semitone when you're trying to tune your guitar between songs/sets"
736,324,4.0,I like the SN-2. Just thought I'd try the SN-8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed.  Snark tuners have always performed well for me.  I play guitar and ukulele.  I've used and own many tuners and brands.  The Snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat.  I usually buy several at a time and give them as gifts to my musician friends.  For anyone who plays acoustic guitar - these things are so handy.
39,324,3.0,"When the unit first arrived, I was concerned because the box had been damaged.  It shipped in an envelop.  However, once I opened it, I discovered an undamaged Snark tuner inside.  In an odd way, this reassured me further, as it obviously took a beating and remained undamaged.  When I put in the battery and turned it on, it functioned properly.  It clips to my guitar strong and stays put.  It's easy to read, even when I'm on stage and the lighting is less than appropriate for reading a display this size from arm's length.  I'm very pleased with the unit."
367,324,4.0,works very smoothly and doesn't eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners. We have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a 5 pack for $1.00 (yep a buck). I'm sold on these and will be getting another as soon as I need one
134,324,4.0,"I just got my Snark tuner, and I'm very impressed with it. It attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar. The digital readout is easy to see, and it gets me in perfect tune quickly. It is far superior to previous tuners I've used."
554,324,4.0,"I have several Snarks. They are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with. Fast and accurate. The SN-8 IS a little faster and slightly more accurate than the other, older models, with a brighter display (at slightly reduced battery life) but they are all great. I have lots of tuners, and several brands of clip ons. This is my favorite. There is no close second. I play 5 string bass in a band and at church as well as guitar. I love this tuner."
944,324,4.0,I got one of these and now a week later I have 3 what a great learning tool. simple and sweet
713,324,4.0,"These snark tuners are really cool.This SN-8 model comes this a metronome, and also you can scale up/down with buttons for when using a capo.highly recommended."
684,324,2.0,It does a fair job but I have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on. It seems to pick up sympathetic string notes. I actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate.
918,723,4.0,"I really think it doesn't matter which Snark you buy, they are all set up to measure tuning within any instrument's range.  It was cheap, and affordable.  One of the issues I've had with Snarks is that if you get the one with the vibe and the mic, the mic quits working, and you really only need the vibe anyway, so why pay more?"
342,723,4.0,It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more. I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it's case. I have given out 5 and kept 4 - I have 11 working guitars - I need 7 more Snarks.....  some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but I get close to 2 years off a new battery - ( Batteries are a bit costly)
544,723,4.0,"I've used a variety of tuners.  When the Snark first came out the price was so low I thought it must not be that good.  However, I borrowed one one time and ended up buying several.  What I like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read (the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display) , is seems to be very accurate, the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough.  I have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners.  About the only thing that has been an issue, is that on occation, it won't register. Turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem.  Also it may be a litle larger than some like."
1150,723,4.0,This is my second and I love them so much. They work flawlessley and tune is amazing! Get one and dont hesitate
999,792,3.0,"This is a nifty little tuner. It's accurate and is fast to turn yellow if you're off by even the slightest degree. I just leave it on my telecaster. It's a little deeper than I thought it would be; it actually lifted the tele up a little when placed in the case. But after a few weeks, the foam conformed and the neck now rests on the case support. The ratchet is a little gimmicky, but once it's set, it can be easy slid off and on the headstock.This little tuner is made to be left on one guitar. If you want one that you can move from instrument to instrument, then get a Snark."
495,792,4.0,"I had one of these and lost it, replaced it with the NS Planet Waves micro clip on tuner, which is not as good. This tuner has a better, higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs. It works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too. Easily worth the extra dollar. It's a little taller than the micro, but still very small and if it's behind a headstock it doesn't make a difference visually, the main difference is the height if the tuner, width and depth are about the same. That also means a bigger readout. So not really a con. I use it on a godin with a slotted headstock, positioned so I can see it between the tuning keys. Easy to use, bummed I lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner, I'll be getting another one of these soon... Should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it."
87,792,4.0,"I've been a musician for over 40 years.  I've seen an awful lot of products come and go.  I don't get excited about the latest-and-greatest very easily... but having said that, this is the best idea in headstock tuners I have encountered. I bought one, and found it so useful, I ordered two more!  Planet Waves makes good quality stuff, and they make some 'faddish' stuff.  This item is definitely in the good quality family.  It's easy to read outdoors in the daylight, yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light.  Great design, Planet Waves!  Excellent price, GO-DPS!"
554,792,3.0,"Not bad, but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument. I bought a few for different basses and guitars. But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag (no problem with hard cases) leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case. The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit. FWIW, I like my Snarks better...faster and more stable tuning. A near miss with the NS."
323,792,4.0,"This little thing is just what I needed for my acoustics. My amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now. I have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up. The read-out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by. Red is wayyy off, yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune. Great for a quick look in between songs. Highly recommended."
550,365,4.0,"When I first installed these strings I wasn't too impressed.  They felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than I'm used to.  However, after a month and a half of playing, I really do love these strings.  I got used to the feel, the tinny sound mellowed out a little, and man do they stay in tune!Cobalt strings aren't as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal I find the gain to be more articulate.  Solo's pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing, in my opinion.  They're also super fast.  I mentioned earlier that they feel different, and they do.  It's not necessarily a bad different it's just slicker and not as coiled feeling.  Hard to describe, but if you're used to playing nickle you'll notice the difference.Honestly, my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune.  I went on vacation for a week, came back, picked up the guitar, expecting to have to tune it, and every single note was dead on.  As they age, you'll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickle.These really are a good set of strings.  If you try them just make sure to give them time.  They get better with wear."
76,365,2.0,"Okay... just strung these up and ran them through three different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc).  So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review.  But I do feel confident in what I report here.They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels.  On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice.... a lot of harmonics and output captured. For that 5 stars easy.  I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold.  Other's may feel differently I am sure.  Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output.  So you are getting what they say.However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels.  For that 1.5 star.  Average to 3 I guess... :).  Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame).  Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment.  For shredding go cobalt... for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!).  I also really like the d'addario pures.Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel.  Hope this helps."
734,365,3.0,I recently changed them out for a different type of EB's while they were good the were not exactly what I was looking for. not sure the new set is either but time will tell.
1035,365,3.0,"The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling. Maybe it's just me, but that's how they come across. I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel, but don't lose that new sound new as fast. I didn't have near as much string stretch with these either. I'll keep using them, just maybe in a different gauge."
288,365,4.0,"Not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no-name Japanese knock-off. I play mostly hard-rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech-metal and prog-rock for solo projects where I'm playing pretty fast and sometimes hard. They also handle de-tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like DADAAD, they are clear with good sustain."
323,365,4.0,"These strings are amazing - they have increased power, tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have. They sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups. The tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone. I cna't say enough about them but get some for yourself - I'd be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings."
527,278,4.0,Works very well although I wish it had wider strapping or a choice of purchasing with a wider strap. Don't hesitate to purchase.
1243,278,3.0,I didn't like the arm through one part and your head through the other so I cut it apart and just hang my uke from my neck and the top of the sound hole. Works like a charm......is more easily adjusted and the felt lined sound hole clip has not damaged my uke at all.
111,278,3.0,"Ukulele straps are a rare thing and I've yet to find the perfect one.  This one gets close.  Not all uke players use straps, some do and some don't.  Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced.  However I have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use.  I've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing.  A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar.  This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less.There is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well.  It ties onto the headstock. I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument isn't balanced perfectly, it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash.  The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple Sling.This Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well, but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the two.The wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument.  I don't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached.  This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments.You have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument.  The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most I've seen and this extra width reduces, but does not completely eliminate, that risk. The wider clip spreads the stress out.  I've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and I'm afraid to try them on a ukulele.  I like this one with the wide clip and will keep it.The Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place, so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device better.The only thing I don't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap.  But once on it is great!  You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can't do it with a hat on.  It gets easier the more you do it.I'd buy the Neotech Simple Sling again.  I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes.  Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on."
146,278,4.0,"I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps.  Bought one and due to past neck surgery, found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes.  Later saw this one and decided to try it.  Works perfect, really adjustable, and no pressure on my neck (since it doesn't go around your neck).  Great design!"
103,278,4.0,"but works well,  I have a different brand which has a string and small hook but I find when adjusted correctly I cannot remove it,,  this sling keeps the head loop large so you can get it off without a binch of hassle,, I find the hook to be wide though and could be alot better with a thinner hook."
497,278,2.0,"I wan't sure I would like this thing when I ordered it, but it was cheap enough to try.  I don't like using it as much as I thought I would, but that's just me.  The device works as advertised.  Over a long period of use, I think it might leave a mark on the sound hole, even though the hook is padded."
276,597,4.0,"These do definitely have more output. I really don't know what else to say about them. It's all about personal preference so... But if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too. Oh, one thing I can say is that harmonic squeals and harmonics in general are better defined and sustain longer with these."
150,597,4.0,"If you bought Rocksmith 2014, and use an electric guitar, get this.  The cobalt strings are picked up very well by the magnetic pickups, and in turn Rocksmith detects the strings A LOT better. I had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up.  After getting these the game picks them all up now."
76,597,2.0,"Tried these on Les Paul style with Jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc). So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review. But I do feel confident in what I report here.They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels.

1279,597,4.0,Great feel to them and nice sounding.  They do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what I normally use.  I think I will try these in the super slinky
804,597,4.0,"These strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume (amplified) than regular nickel / steel strings. Cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life. I recently ordered the new M-Steels from Ernie Ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more Cobalt for even better output. I use P90 single coils on my Godin LG and these strings sound great. They have a nice feel to them and I can bend the heck out of them. No breaking. No problems with slipping and tuning. I'm hoping the M-Steels will be even better, but if not, these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that I was using, which were Ernie Ball's regular slinky's, made from Nickel."
205,597,3.0,"These strings are really nice.  They have a great tone, decent longevity, and the trademark Ernie Ball feel.  Some reviewers have stated that the strings have a silky feel - even comparing them to coated strings - but I don't find that to be the case.  They feel pretty much like any other guitar string, albeit much gentler than stainless strings.  If money were no option, I'd probably move to these exclusively, but at roughly three times the price of good to great nickel strings, I'm not sure that they are good enough to justify the massive price premium.  Each string did come inside its own protective sleeve, which made restringing easier and is a feature that I absolutely expect from a premium string."
979,597,1.0,"Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser. I had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good. But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. If anything they feel worse than regular strings. Last but not least: they are bad for frets. Just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear."
183,597,2.0,Not great but not bad as well.  The base strings feel really strange when sliding. The 6th string and the 1st string were cut while I was playing so I had to change them the second day I installed them.  Bending feels easy.
858,597,4.0,"The best EB Slinky's I've ever used. On these I use the light's--9's. Even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well. I use them on all 4 of My Guitar's. Two Fender American Standard's, Gibson ES-335. Gibson Les Paul/ with Bigsby. I always have a set in each case..... Try'um... Ya won't regret it !!!!!"
323,597,4.0,"These lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them. My other review was for the heavier gauge Cobalts but these sound just as good, regardless of P90, strat single coil or humbucker. Great tone, sustain and flexibility. I am sold on any Cobalt gauge - head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and I have tried them all."
897,597,4.0,"I love these strings. I get a much higher output , much better response and much better sound. Great strings for just a little more."
1399,597,4.0,"I've tried other strings with the Jackson with no luck ( what a stupid guitar to string ) anyway I like the sound they do seem to carry better, if only a little. The texture seems to be a bit rougher but I'm sure they will be fine to play once broken in. Pulse there Rocksmith endorsed LOL."
715,304,4.0,"I bought this harmonica for our son...the music enthusiast. He loves it. It seems to be manufactured well...as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built. Only time will tell. But for now it seems to be a decent harmonica. I actually bought two harmonicas for him, just in case one breaks. Couldn't pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price. Our son says it's easy to use and has a good sound quality.  Hey, if it makes our son happy, so be it. Highly recommend."
874,304,4.0,I bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music. This was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well.
888,304,4.0,It was suggested that I start with this product since I'm learning and adding it to my repertoire of instruments.  Comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding.
508,304,0.0,"kripes man..the one time I go and actually buy a ""honer"" and its a ""bummer"" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk. Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!...... all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy ""suzuki"" or Swan"" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a ""Mississipi River Harp"" for only  $5.oo if you have a ""Burke's"" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)"
433,304,4.0,Good little instrument to pass the time with while setting on a porch or at a campfire with friends. Buy this.
93,304,4.0,"I'm a beginner harmonica player, and this was perfect for me! I am able to practice with it easily, and it didn't cost me a fortune as some of the more professional harmonicas are."
105,304,3.0,"I suppose it does what it is suppose to do, it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if I want to spend more bucks for a better one."
1069,304,4.0,"This harmonica is great for beginners, or professionals. I know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones. Highly recommended. Plays, sounds, feels and looks great. Also comes with a little note sheet"
43,304,4.0,"Excellent for a serious youngster learning to play, priced right.  The thirteen-year-old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well."
372,375,4.0,I love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop. It has two brightness settings. Illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly.
804,375,4.0,"We got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night. He really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by, but not too bright that it hurts his eyes. A good buy. I could see where this could be useful in other applications, like on a music stand, but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed."
544,375,2.0,"I found the brightness of the light to be adequate, and would probably give it 4 or 5 stars, but it takes three AAA batteries that according to the packaging are only good for 7 hours. I did not realize this when I bought it, but after replacing the batteries a few times I went to a local music store and asked for a light that you could plug in to the AC.  They sold me the Encore model for $35, it is brighter, includes the AC adaptor and a nice carrying case  After I got home I figured out that they sell an optional AC adaptor for the hammerhead for about $10, so for only $5 I could have just bought the Encore model and been better off.  If you are going to get one of these hammerhead lights, go ahead and spring for one that includes the adaptor, it will save you a lot of money in the long run."
630,375,1.0,"Not really bright enough. Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same.  I would look for something else if I didn't already have this.  OK for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough."
1362,375,4.0,This little dude does a great job. The clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries. I highly recommend. I can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine!
1142,375,2.0,"Cool little light, but three minor gripes: (1) the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible, (2) the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy, and (3) the light is a little on the dim side. But I think it'll work well overall and I like the fact that it's so compact and portable."
57,611,4.0,"If you've read my review of the much cheaper Hohner Old Standby Harmonica, Key of C you know that I love the Special 20. It's great for beginners or experts alike. Sounds great right out of the box and plays well. I was able to bend notes right away with this one, while other cheaper harps take a long time (or never) to break in properly. All the notes/reeds sounded good. If you're serious about playing, you will be very happy to have this harmonica around. I've had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite."
853,611,4.0,This is the first harmonica I ever used. I did some research and ended up with the special 20 in the key of C. I have no basis for comparison and I am a beginner but this instrument sounds awesome! The construction is perfect and the included case is very appreciated : ) For $25 I can't complain!
1074,611,4.0,"tennessee saxe/fun to use... not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon.. Still, seems to be good quality..Of course Hohner has been around longer than me...."
532,611,4.0,Easy to play. Decent quality. Not expensive. Easy to bend. Plastic comb with no recess.This is the lowest level you'd want to really play the harmonica and it won't break the bank.
804,611,3.0,"I am a ""newbie"" to the world of playing the blues harp; however, I am not a beginner to music. I have played guitar fervently for the past 22 years, so I knew a little something when I thought I would try to learn the harmonica. Technique is of utmost importance and I found learning how to pucker and tongue block on this instrument was effortless. It sounds, for the most part, in tune and its tone is great. My kids love to hear me play it! However, there is 1 ""con"" to this wonderful instrument. After owning it for several days, the DRAW 2 hole went flat. I researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit... so I worked on my technique some more. To my dismay, the one note on the harmonica that allows you to bend into 2 other tones, and is considered the ""sweet spot"" of the instrument, did not work right. Obviously you cannot take it back to the seller - it's not really his/her fault. I am not sure how to repair it, but I feel that I should have to do so this early in the game. Maybe it's my naivete' in hoping for a perfect instrument. So, I took one star away because of this problematic issue. Otherwise, I really like this harmonica."
344,611,4.0,"Sounds great! Still suck at bending 3 &4. A buddy of mine got one, and he's killing it on the bends. we both been playing for about 3 months. Great harp. Will buy another if it ever wears out."
78,611,4.0,"I bought the Special 20 Pro Pack(Keys G,A & C)!!Love them. Was using cheep Pidmont Blues Harps(toys)!!I had to have more, like an addiction!!I bought a D then this Bb, then E.Won't be long & I'll get a F!!This harp,Bb, has a beautiful tone.Always loved the sound of the Bb!!Made in Germany,quality musical instrument,not a toy!!If you own Special 20's then you already know how good they are.If you don't try one.You might end up with 6 like me,or more,in no time!!Worth every cent!!If they are good enough for John Popper & Bob Dylan they're good enough for me.A PLEASURE to play!!!Joe"
364,611,4.0,Really great sounding harmonica. Beautiful sound and very well made! Very happy with this product and the price is incredible!
822,611,4.0,First real harmonica i have owned. Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many. The price is right and the quality seems good too. Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single/double blow/draw. Still trying to get the overblow. I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on. It has a good seal also. Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back.
107,611,4.0,"I am forever meeting people who rave about this harp, but had not tried one for myself until today. It is a wonderful harp, with perfect tuning, easy bend-ability, does not buzz or squeak, and belies it's reasonable sale price.  I went for the Key of Bb, and love the tone, the playability and the just right feel of the instrument. For anyone not yet having a Special 20, I heartily recommend it - beginner, intermediate or advanced students, or the performer on stage - this harp is simply great. I am not often surprised by anything but this harp surprised me - it is not expensive at all, and sounds as good as others I have that are four times the price. I am a Hohner Marine Band Special Twenty convert  - I will get a couple more to add to my ever growing box of harps."
31,74,4.0,"I've been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010.  Good news:  these Aquila strings are on most new ukuleles.  Bad news:  These Aquila strings are NOT standard on some others.  I was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than half-hour.  (You can get a tutorial to do anything on YouTube!)  They will stretch and de-tune for a few days, but once tuned, they sound, and just perform, great.  Good price, great product.  Order extra to keep on hand."
802,74,4.0,"You can't go wrong with aquila. Amazing song, very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too.Long lasting, made with quality. Improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a 50 dollar uke sound like a 100 dollar uke!"

847,724,4.0,"I put these on an Epiphone Les Paul acoustic-electric and it sounds so great. They are very smooth and warm and magical, like a mythical unicorn."
567,724,4.0,"Great strings, the strings on my Epiphone Les Paul wore out so i bought these, my ukulele sounds better than when i first bought it. Kinda wish they came in black, the white contrasts with the color of my uke."
1330,724,4.0,Best strings for my ukulele. These are great quality. I only use Aquila strings on my instruments. Highly recommended. My ukulele has a better tone with these strings.
462,724,3.0,However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching.  Usually I do. My bad.
736,724,4.0,These strings are the best.  Haven't found any others that sound and feel so good.  They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours.  Go figure!  I actually thought I didn't need to change strings (still don't know for sure) because they still sounded so good and show no wear.  Anyway I decided to change the strings because it's been so long.  Happy that I did however.

881,724,4.0,"Aquila strings will never let you down. Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players. Italian made, need I say more."
778,749,4.0,"I admit it, my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick. Hold my tab securely so I can flip though it with ease while I'm still playing my guitar. Much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage."
1261,749,3.0,"I had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that I almost sent it back.But with a little trial and error, I figured it out.That said, this thing is ROCK SOLID... I was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a $700 iPad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip, but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip."
1368,749,4.0,Easy to adjust and holds the iPad secure.  I actually have 2 iPads on one mic stand (one shows charts while the other plays backing tracks).  No issues at all and would order again.
565,749,4.0,"I'm the lead singer in a band and I use an app on my Kindle Fire as a teleprompter, This mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face. The mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the Kindle fire and mount suffered no damage. The mount is easy to remove as well"
770,749,4.0,"I use this clamped to a table and it's a superb product. I have a 7&#34; tablet, and a 9.7&#34; Touchpad, and they both work very well in it. Nice mount. Great value. Buy it."
71,749,4.0,I've been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great! Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient. It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily. I've owned it for a while now and haven't had any problems with it.
0,749,1.0,"I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts (for iPhone) which I like a lot.Pros:The clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover (Marware Axis).Quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well.Cons:It's too heavy for my mic stands.  I tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable.  If the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!The clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.I had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me.  I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model, the one with the lever-type mount."
1310,749,4.0,"I was a little nervous about putting my iPad on the stand, but this is a substantial and well thought out design. It comes with clips that can be used for other tablets. It's very nicely adjustable and I feel very confident that my iPad is safe and secure on the stand."
983,749,4.0,This is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music/speeches.  It is easily mounted on the Mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs. I would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand. I am using it with my Samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife's Toshiba tablet.  Highly recommended.
1205,749,3.0,It does the job. It's bulky but it works well. It comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets (or to use the tablet while still in the case).
775,749,0.0,"This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside.  Upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it.  It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability.  The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle."
1139,749,1.0,"First time using item and it broke. The round back that screws onto the mic stand broke. I was really excited to have this and us it now that I transferred all my music sheet to my iPad. As soon as I took it off the mic stand the round piece came off. Would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review, but it only kept referring to delivery. I do like the product and it did hold my iPad steady even with a leather case on. Sad!"
1082,749,3.0,"This tablet mount allows me to use my large Toshiba Thrive in live performance situations now.  It makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand, I never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use."
820,107,3.0,Love joyo pedals.  Not sure yet on the new line.  They just dont feel as solid to me. That being said the pedal sounds great. great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch. time will tell
511,107,4.0,"This Joyo JF-34 US dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion effect. My son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques. This box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effects.The box is very good quality, with nice large controls and metal foot switch. The unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source (not included).This is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players.Highly Recommended!CFHNote: Manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments."
1236,107,4.0,"Reading the product description may give you an idea about this product. I received, plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion. It's solid, well made and looks/feels like it can handle the world tour.Get it!"
241,107,4.0,"this pedal is simple...i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals ,.i love them all...they all differ somewhat,,,,i fell in love with this one the most,.,set volume and gain to maximum loudness that you desire,,,then back off your guitar volume and it cleans up wonderfully....and when you are ready to wail, just turn up your guitar volume.,,,,and whammo,...its a very non-colored sounding overdrive...,,its hard to call it any particualr sound...its just really good and clear and powerful...."
281,107,3.0,"I realized I didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so I set out to find a distortion pedal.  After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey.  Since I don't want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright.  The only thing I don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent. Transparent in that it doesn't add a lot of color to your amp just distortion.  I use this pedal with vintage Fender Silverface amps, which are already bright, so I turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the Spark Booster that I have in front of the US Dream. I have to use the Spark Booster to hit the US Dream hard because most of the guitars I use don't have hot enough pickups.The price was right, I'm happy with it."
367,107,0.0,"This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product. These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal. It was to be shipped from Japan. They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident."
1044,107,3.0,"Reputedly the Joyo Us Dream is a copy of the Suhr Riot distortion pedal. After watching a side by side comparison on Youtube, I decided to buy one.I would describe the Us Dream as sounding like a bright Proco Rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end. It has an MXR style enclosure (that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries) and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot. But for $48 dollars I'm  happy with purchase."
1404,107,4.0,"Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks! Highly adjustable tone, volume and distortion level that won't tank your amplifier tone, while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal. I love this pedal!!! The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amp's tone, but lose it when you engage your pedal. Not anymore. I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market, but you won't find this quality and tone at a better price. Joyo win.Sorry OS-2 - it's pawnshop time for you!"
1157,107,4.0,"The US Dream is supposed ""clone"" of the Suhr Riot, and is the only one of the ""new"" model Joyo pedals that I own.  This is a high-gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a ProCo Rat, but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings.When I first pulled it out of the box and plugged in, it sounded great, but I wondered if it might be a little bright.  I was pleasantly surprised when I rolled back the tone knob to around 10 o'clock, and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness.  At least with my setup (Les Paul into a Vox Valvetronix 40-watt), this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full-sounding power chords and singing high leads.  Unlike some distortion pedals that have a ""fizzy"" (DS-1) or ""cocked wah"" sound (Boss Power Stack), I was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar.While Joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices, this is one of the first three I would recommend, along with the outstanding Ultimate Drive and the warm-sounding Vintage Overdrive.However, it's worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the ""new"" model Joyo pedals, which are notably lighter than those numbered JF-17 and lower.  The weight is comparable to an MXR '78 Badass Distortion, except the switch and output jacks are more suspect.  Still, if a pedal SOUNDS great and has yet to fail on me, I refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me.  I think if you take care of it and use it reasonably, it should last for awhile, but if it doesn't, being out $55 is still better than being out $100+."
732,342,4.0,"I just received this a day ago and bought it on whim after being very impressed with the Joyo Crunch Pedal.  This is (I think) based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal.  It's supposed to be very reactive to your playing.  Dig in and it puts out distortion, play soft and it cleans up.  This is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp.  I can say it's pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer.  I've heard some say they find the distortion from this pedal a little harsh but I find is wonderfully smooth with some grit.  I found it really warmed up my sound in a good way.  I'm playing an american strat with noisless Dimarzio Area pickups through a Vox AC15 and it's an awesome combo.  I put this pedal in front of my OCD and I was really getting some sweet tones.  If I had to play out with just my amp and one pedal for a little dirt this might win over my OCD.  It's expensive for a Joyo but cheap for a really good OD stomp.  It's definitely not for metal or heavier distortion stuff but it's got plenty on tap for blues and classic rock.  So far I've been super pleased by Joyo pedals.  The jury is still out on how well they hold but but they sure sound and perform pretty darn well."
820,342,3.0,"this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there.  I have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together.  Definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised.  Lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedalLike many other reviewers, my gripe with the new pedals is the switch. may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation"
536,342,4.0,"This is my 6th Joyo pedal and like the others, it does not dissapoint.  I think these and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days.  Like many have mentioned, this pedal is like a TS but without the mid-hump.  This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture.  When you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it, it breaks up.  When you play lightly, it gets cleaner- which is why it is so similar to the $200 Sweet Honey pedal (the controls are also identical but I haven't compared the internals).  That touch sensitivity is lost IMHO if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain.  When you do that, it acts more like a traditional OD would- which is totally cool, but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart.  If I could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more mid-gain (like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or the Dano Transparent OD)  but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and don't have that kind of bankroll, you should definately check this out-Edit:  Having owned this pedal for a while, I realize I was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox.  This pedal actually plays well with mid-gain types of overdrives like the Joyo Ultimate Drive, the OCD, or the Dano Drive.  When you dig in, you CAN get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isn't dimed.  This pedal has become an essential, 'always on' pedal for me !"
1184,342,4.0,This is my favorite pedal...and I have a ton. Lots of high end pedal and this a cheap (only in price) pedal! Great bluesy tones....sweet and warm when the drive is down...mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up. Like a cranked tube amp. If you play the blues...this is your pedal. I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
1066,342,1.0,"I've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super Overdrive...Sweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well. I have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. It really does react to your playing style. Unlike other overdrive pedals I've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it ""focus"", there is also a volume and drive knob. The sounds I can get out of the Sweet Baby are some of the best I've ever used and easy to dial in. I own a lot of pedals but lately I keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a EHX-Crying Tone wah pedal, then the Sweet Baby, then a Boss Super Overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... I don't use Distortion pedals.), next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay. The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp. I use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... I play mostly Blues and Classic Rock. The Sweet Baby is well made and I don't see it failing me anytime soon. You can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this ""clone"" overdrive tone blender...Update: this pedal has since been returned. It went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. The connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...I have since put my Boss Super Overdrive back in the chain...while I truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for."
985,342,4.0,"If you don't like too much dirt in your tone, this might be the pedal for you.The Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally.If you have a fairly clean single channel amp, it won't give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels.  However, if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking, step on this pedal and you'll be rewarded. If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp, set the gain low and boost it with this pedal. The notes ring clear with the extra bite, and brightness to cut thru the mix.......sweet! You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesn't color your sound.  (No mid-hump)I use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive, OCD and the dirt channel on my amp.The pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made.  It's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives.  Instead of a tone knob, it has a ""focus knob"" which controls your picking dynamics and presence.  All the way to the left, the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp.  All the way to the right, when you pick the strings hard, it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence.  The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control.  I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob.  At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after, it's a no brainer."
320,342,4.0,"I bought this based on video reviews on the net.  My first impressions:To my ears, if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates ""fat"" power tube distortion, this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp, with a bit of edge, sharpness, the kind of edge the tube amps have.  The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metal.Over all though, this is great for lightly distorted / edge of distorted sounds.  It gave my clean tone a sharper, more ""amp like"" tone (that is, midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle.) I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff, it just has that chimey, vintage amp character (very early marshalls, older fenders) with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation.  If your clean channel is overly ""flat"", this will liven it up to more ""sharp"", scooped tone, which to my ears sounds more vintage.Basically, from Hendrix to modern de-tuned metal (with a definite mids emphasis - not ""80s marshall mids"" but  modern mids emphasis)."
1157,342,4.0,"Wow.  I have been impressed with a lot of Joyo's products, but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended, and hasn't disappointed.  I held off a little bit until the price came down, but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny it's sold for, and then some.As the description says, this is a ""mild overdrive"".  It won't give you the ""Brown Sound"".  It's not meant for metal.  It's almost like adding a tube-amp ""gain"" knob to your existing rig, add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone.  Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out.  Unlike many ""tube"" overdrive pedals, this thing has tons of volume on tap.  You can set the ""Drive"" to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost.  Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock.  But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone, as opposed to an ""effect"" that transforms it.  In that respect, it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD-3 Overdrive, which is a vastly underrated pedal (though the OD-3 probably offers more gain).The Focus knob is interesting - it doesn't act exactly like a tone knob.  As you turn it up, it doesn't remove bass, but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone.  The lower settings are bluesy - the higher settings are bright and dynamic.  But chances are, both will sound good.There are some concerns you could have about the build quality - the switch may not be built to last 20 years, and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying.  I also wish they'd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side.  But those are mostly minor gripes.  It's an excellent overdrive and an incredible value."
820,534,4.0,very nice compressor.  I leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone/sustain.  Can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing.  Quiet - much quieter than other compressors in this price range.  No concerns here
61,534,4.0,"Fantastic pedal, especially considering the price. Prior to this pedal, I've used an MXR Dyna Comp and a TC Electronics Nova Dynamics compressor. This is low-noise compared to the MXR and simple to use. It doesn't get as &#34;squashy&#34; as other compressors, so don't plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output."
1184,534,4.0,I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
1066,534,0.0,"Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for."
454,534,1.0,The unit I received did not work. I returned it. I like the other joyo pedals I ordered so I am going to give this one another shot.
1179,534,3.0,"It could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr, but it does what it is supposed to."
293,534,1.0,"Although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked, the attack knob (the control for how much compression you want to apply) did absolutely nothing. I even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.Perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one, but none-the-less I returned the pedal back to Amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board."
593,534,4.0,"This is probably the best pedal purchase I have ever made.  I'm not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better, but this one sounds exactly how I would expect a compressor to work.  It just makes things sound solid.  I've watched the wave envelope it puts out using Audacity and Adobe Audition and the compression works as advertised."
324,534,3.0,"I've had this for almost a year. While I'm no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes, I haven't used a compressor pedal since Washburn made that really janky, noisy compressor pedal in the late 80's. I have never used a Ross, so the fact that this is supposedly a clone didn't have any influence over my decision to buy the Joyo. I will say that it's not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it. Sure, I love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do, but compression takes time to dial in, even if you are familiar with it. That said, I finally love this pedal and feel that I can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrive/distortion. I bought it mainly because I play in a Rush cover band, and the harmonics at the beginning and end of Red Barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until I got the Joyo dialed in. Compression isn't the easiest effect to dial in, but once you're there, you can pretty much leave it set as long as you're using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars. Great pedal once you get it dialed in. Take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as I am."
638,534,0.0,"It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp.  Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument."
1157,534,4.0,"As thrilled as I have been with the Chinese-made Joyo overdrive and distortion pedals I've tried out in the recent past, I felt like the JF-10 Dyna Compressor was somewhat of a risk.  I had been using the very excellent MXR Custom Comp already, but was frustrated with its lack of external controls and versatility.  Also, it's one thing thing for Joyo to ""clone"" the circuitry of a distortion pedal, but could they do it accurately with an ""always on"" effect like compression?Well, Joyo has absolutely done it, and they've done it well enough that I'm selling my MXR.  Compressors are hard to explain, and even harder to demonstrate on a YouTube video, so let me offer my explanation of what this pedal does, and why you should give it a try for only around $40.The primary effect of compression is to ""level"" or normalize the output across frequencies.  Particularly with a clean signal, aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells.  Also, certain notes sustain, while others seem to die out too early.  Compression ""smooths"" over these problems and levels everything to a polished, presentable sound.The secondary effect of compression is that the pedal can sustain single notes and chords by increasing their level after they would normally die out.  In this area, the Joyo JF-10 is superior to many other compressors because it gives you ""Attack"" and ""Sustain"" knobs.  ""Attack"" refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck.  Turning the knob up produces a ""chicken picking"" effect where the note is very clear and pronounced.  Adjusting the ""Sustain"" knob, obviously, increases the length of time that the note or chord continues to play at volume.  Like most compressors, there is also a ""Level"" control to change the volume of the compressed sound.Of the compressors you can actually find under $100 (such as the MXR Dyna Comp and BOSS CS-3 Compression Sustainer), I like this one the best.  The MXR models have a good clarity of tone, but with only two knobs, the lack of customization is a problem.  You may want high sustain or attack for playing U2-type guitar parts, but might find excess sustain too ""messy"" for punchy AC/DC riffs.  The Joyo allows you to make this change easily.The BOSS CS-3 is a good pedal that has controls for attack, sustain, and also tone, but the pedal produces a lot of noise, and the resulting tone sounds too digitized.  Also, a ""tone"" knob on a compression pedal strikes me as an admission that the pedal is CHANGING your tone, which good compression really shouldn't do.  The Joyo Dyna Compressor sounds like MY guitar and amp, it just puts some polish on the final product, and allows me to add sustain and ""punch"" if I see fit.  Great pedal, and amazing value!"
204,525,3.0,"Joyo continues to surprise me. This thing is all metal, looks very sleek, is true bypass, and all around works well.The individual bands actually light up, which is pretty cool.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch. You can see the led on nearly every other Joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look. However it doesn't even show up in the product picture on amazon. It wasn't a big deal, I just drilled a little 1/8&#34;ish hold and it fits through."
1219,525,3.0,"For the price, this lil guy does the job.  I got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables.  The pedal is somewhat cheaply made, the jacks don't really seem to fit the housing so well, but i do have it somewhat semi-permanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue."
1181,525,3.0,"I was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from Joyo but took a chance on the EQ.  I really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should.  I use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the EQ but it can be used to get a scooped sound, mids boost, hi/lowpass or whatever you need.  It's a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass.  When the pedal is engaged the 6 lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enough.I would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed.  Not the performance side of the pedal as far as I can tell, but for example, the ""N"" on the ""IN"" label on the right is backwards, and it comes in a weird box with plenty of Engrish so I'm skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on.  Time will tell, but for now it seems like a great box for the money."
285,525,4.0,I like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments- I run this through a Furman pedal board and there is little to no noise - for the money this is a good product-
889,525,2.0,"Alright, it was $30 not $130 - I already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most &#34;sound-sculpting&#34; investment you could make. As a mid range, lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though."
1417,525,4.0,For not a whole lot of money it does what more expensive EQ pedals do. Its well made and sturdy with a metal body.
226,380,3.0,"The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros. Ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only $40 so why not? The first thing i learned about this pedal is It does what it's suppose to do but with some drawbacks. There is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal. If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you'd be up the creek. Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does ""fuzz"" things then that's why I give it 4 stars. I deduct 1 star because the loud feedback. But in the long run I would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative."
1276,380,2.0,"This pedal sort of let me down a bit.I really cannot find a musical sounding adjustment,I can hear a small amount of octave when I adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switch.If this was more of an octave pedal I would have been entirely more into the way it sounds.I kept it because to be honest it is very cheap.Why bother sending it back? It is a very good paper weight and I have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with it.Lets face it,If someone breaks into my house I can whack them on the head with it and knock them out.I just cannot get any octave sounds idk am I missing something? Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth."
732,380,2.0,"I got this from a ""direct from china"" vendor.  When it arrived the volume pot was not working.  It would only operate at about the first 1/4 of travel and then die off.  I was ready to give up but on the second day it just started working(???).  So I don't know if it's a fair representation of these pedals.  I have two other fuzz's(Swollen Pickle & MXR 108 Classic Fuzz).  To me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed.  The Octave feature is a little useless for anything other than lead work and the mid-cut makes it a bit nasal sounding.  Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty cool pedal but it's not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals.  But those pedals are about $100+ so if you just want to play around with a fuzz pedal this might do the trick.  But do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon.  All in all I think if you really want a quality fuzz pedal you might be better off somewhere else.  I own a few other joyo pedals that I love but to me this one is just OK."
536,380,2.0,"I am a fan of Joyo-  I own the vintage OD, the Ultimate Drive, the Sweet Baby, the US Dream,  the Crunchbox clone, and this one.  This is probably my least favorite Joyo pedal.  I'm giving it 3 stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap, but the octive leaves much to be desired.  I have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue.  Apparently, one of the components is installed in a reversed positon, which results in the lackluster octive.  I haven't taken mine apart for the fix, but I read that it's just unsolder, flip, and resolder the same component.  You can google it for better instructions.  Still, this ain't bad for the pocket change they charge.  The reason I haven't fixed it yet is I have the feeling that once I mod it, it will sound just like my Dano French Toast- albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass-"
1151,380,4.0,I can bear it and dig it cause fuzzy wuzzy was a bear and it is green like the frog ....dig it.  I must have gotten a really good one cause mine sounds great and is nothing like those on You Tube that sound so bad the only bad in mine is that what comes before behind and it is bad @55
73,380,3.0,"For the price, this is an amazing pedal. The sound from a $40 pedal is outstanding, much better than I ever expected.The Voodoo is a fuzz pedal, meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound. This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave. Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix. I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box, the sustain is big. All was not completely perfect, it might be me and the way I'm adjusting this, but I had a bit of trouble with feedback.From a sound standpoint, this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound. Combined with Joyo's California, Hendrix is almost in the house. (Joyo JF-15 Guitar Effect Pedal California Sound True Bypass)I have a Boss ME-70 multi-effect pedal. This Joyo single effect pedal blows away my Boss pedal, I'm almost sad to say that. I don't have experience with other single effect pedals, so I can't make a comparison to those more costly pedals.I have a Marshall Amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers. My guitar is a Gibson Les Paul 2008 Standard Plus.From a construction standpoint, these are remarkable for the price point. The whole thing has a good weight. The base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it. The box is a solid cast metal box, with a very heavy metal base. The bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box. The 1/4 inch input and output jacks are really sweet - there is a metal insert that screws into the plastic internal jack. It looks to me like it would be very hard to break this jack - that outer ring is heavy duty. The pots look really good. For this pedal, they went with press on knobs. If the knob ever breaks, they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack. The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch. Given that it is between three knobs, I think it would be hard to break this switch - but it is a little lighter weight than I would like.The pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery. It also has a standard 9V power jack on the side, to use an AC adapter or large rechargeable battery pack.This is not a high end pedal, at this price point, nobody should ever expect that. But darn it, this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price. Well worth the investment.The GateShop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review."
241,380,2.0,"ok pedal.,,,,it does very good at bedroom volume,,,,,but at cranked Marshall stage volume, I do not like it,,,it does not play well then,,,the octave gets crazy..and screamy,,the fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes...,,,I got a Bonamassa Fuzz Face,,,end of search,,,"
29,380,3.0,This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after. For the price and product quality you can't go wrong with this one. And the functionality is great! Use it as a fuzz/distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic Jimi Hendrix like tones and harmonics
200,380,2.0,"This device sounds okay, its usable. But you should plan ahead if you're in the USA and want one, it ships from mainland China, it takes a while to get to the States."
593,380,2.0,"I'm not sure what I was expecting.  This definitely is a fuzz, but the one I got doesn't seem to have much in the way of subtlety.  It's either nothing, a lot, a lot more or way too much.  It's not bad and it's probably just my personal preferences, but this just isn't my cup of tea."
135,380,2.0,Not the greatest pedal..  Gives a really broken sound.  There is no mid way on this pedal either...  It seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing.  The octave is a joke.  Having said all that I could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance.
245,380,4.0,I love this it's do fun to play with. Every pedal that I buy of joyo amaze me. They are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price. I'm sold out on joyo pedals.
766,500,3.0,I've got several guitars and CAPOs - this one is not too bad. I would still prefer classic style. Seems like spring is a bit too strong. Price is great thou!
337,500,4.0,Easy to use from day one and I am a beginner at the guitar - would recommend it to any one.
267,500,2.0,"I bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case. I like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases. It works okay for 6 string guitars, but not even okay for 12 string guitars, plus the spring, became loose. You get what you pay for in this case."
951,500,3.0,This works fine on a standard guitar.  No issues whatever.  I see other reviewers having issues.  Not sure if that's from rough handling.  But for casual use this one is completely fine.
586,47,4.0,"I have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years. I have found no major issues with any of them. Expect to do a small amount of fretwork, such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends, checking the frets for crowns, filing those down and polishing the frets. As with any neck, even the high dollar ones, the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up. They come unfinished but well sanded. I sand a bit extra, but one could spray it out of the box. I like to use 3 coats of amber and 6 to 9 coats of clear lacquer, satin or semi gloss. None of these are select quarter sawn wood, but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument."
578,47,2.0,well it is worth the money in my opinion however i had to take about a quarter inch total off the sides for it to fit the pocket not that difficult really. the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished. the rod had to be  adjusted to get proper relief and the headstock is a little larger than a fender. for the price worth the small effort it took to get it rockn
380,47,4.0,Fretted Maple Fender(R) Telecaster(TM)-style Neck with Truss Rod this is one of many fender necks I have purchased from this company I have built several telecasters and fender P bass and Stratocaster bodies all so far have been great to play the quality in the wood is great. I have purchased Womack&#8217;s in the past granted there superb necks but there price is way over the top. When I must replace a neck I think for the money this isa great way to go JohnJ
447,47,3.0,"I have yet to install this neck, but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect. There is little to no evidence of corners being cut, just to start. Materials and labor all look good to great. Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money. Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most &#34;econo necks&#34; seem to be off by at least 1/8.&#34; I'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill. Frets look good, and nut looks good. Until I can install it, I can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.Long story short is this neck looks better than many I've had that cost 2X as much, or more. Unless it has a twist or hump, it actually earns the 5th star. Even if the frets need a little cleanup, it still earns the 5th star. While some may not like the flatter radius, I'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren't as much of an issue. And it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish, but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all. So again, another reason for the 5th star."
753,47,2.0,"The neck is  well made . the fit ..it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same time.I did have to sand the neck a little , it had a bump in it .. the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most ..it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states !!"
97,664,3.0,"I like the capo, only it seems a little stiff when opening it up to put it on or take it off.  It was actually a bronze color instead of gold, but that's not a big deal to me.  I'm interested on the durability of this, but for the price, how can you go wrong?"
1072,664,4.0,It arrived on time and was as described. Price was very reasonable.  It is easy to use with one hand and does the job.  Not sure what else can be said about a capo.  They either work or do not.  The other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that.
1029,664,3.0,I think I got a great buy love the color and it has a strong spring holds very well great price
356,664,4.0,I like this a lot better than others that i have.  Easy on and off and stays put. It's worth the money.
694,664,3.0,"Felt kind of too stiff and rigid to put on a guitar at first, but the more you use it, the more it will wear in (pretty redundant sounding, I know.) The color advertised was not the one I received."
225,664,4.0,This works well with the mandolin.  It is certainly an easy change.  I would recommend it &/or purchase again.
114,664,3.0,"A friend gives his time to help kids learn music. .He mentioned the need for one, so Got it. It appeared to be built well and I've not heard any complaints about the performance. Not very helpful sorry!"

1207,861,2.0,"Eh. I wish I had more of a passion to play it, but....ehh. It's not bad if you want a uke, but it's pretty small. I don't know what I was expecting. I don't know shit about ukuleles but I do know get a bigger one if you're not comfortable with small frets. If you wanna be that one fat Hawaiian guy, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, go for it. but I think he played a little bigger uke than this, lmao."
802,861,4.0,I'm a seasoned player of almost 10 years. I have owed a 300 dollar martin soprano uke which I had to sell in a time of need for rent money. I've been sad ever since. I'm in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play. I just got this uke today. Now aesthetically this uke isn't as pleasing as say a martin sorpano...but..... it sounds amazing for the price. nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too! I have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation. This ukes sound is at least as good as a 50-100 dollar uke! seriously impressed. I see they make a mahogany version i think du200? which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone. I may get one in the future its only 40-50 bucks on here amazing! anyway this uke is 29 bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated too!I see some people complaining about the strings....and how it goes out of tune fast.when i got my martin soprano which wasn't cheap it did the same thing. best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long time.Anyway this diamond head DU-150 soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played. Its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists! excellent!!!!!!!!!!! would recommend this brand to anyone!
1365,861,3.0,"This is a good budget uke. I'm not a ukulele expert; to me they all sound a little toyish. This one has better tone and projection than some of the ones I've played in stores. I haven't tested it with scientific instruments or anything, but I have a good ear (former professional tuba player, current music teacher, enthusiastic amateur guitarist) and the chords sound nice and in tune to me. The tuners are cheap, but they are geared, which is nice, and it stays in tune decently. It's not the Stradivarius of ukuleles; the finish is pretty bland, and the sound is not exactly a revolution.  I have used it to teach a class for teachers on using music in their classrooms, and it performed well. My experience with offshore budget instruments leads me to believe that quality control may be spotty, but I only have the one, and it is good. It is neck heavy, but they all are in my experience, and it seems pretty sturdy, although I've been very gentle with it."
662,861,3.0,"I recently ordered 5 different ukulele models while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few options.Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard - NaturalDiamond Head DU-150 Ukulele, NaturalMahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele (Orange)Lanikai LU-11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina, Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under $30 at the time and within $2 price of each other.  Of the three, I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality.  The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles (which had the original strings).  A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly, but even then, the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level.The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings, and each includes a nice (for this price) little gig bag.  The Mahalo has the most ""island"" look to my eyes and the best sound.  Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head's.  That being said, it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it's so near the same price (compared to the  Diamond Head) and has heavier strings already installed.  I've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages.On an almost irrelevant note, the Diamond Head was the only instrument of the 5 to arrive in something close to actual tuned-up string tension.  It takes several days for these nylon strings to stretch and settle in, but I didn't have to retune the Diamond Head so much because it was already virtually in tune.  This would not be my primary concern with purchasing an instrument for myself but may be a significant headache-saver for a non-musician parent purchasing a ukulele for a young child."
229,861,4.0,"I got 2 of these for grandkids.  They are all right.  I felt as if the uke was well worth the low price.  Like any uke, strings take a long time to set --- sometimes feels as if they never will.  probably would be improved with a set of Aguilas.  Buy a clipon tuner, too.  Snarf makes a great one that has both the vibration-sensing mode and a microphone, can be set for various instruments or chromatic, AND has a metronome function --- and they are so inexpensive!"
881,861,4.0,"Awesome instrument. It stays in tune and is fun to play. The best $29 that I've spent in a long time. After a week, I'm already playing songs and I'm not a string player. Don't purchase this without buying a tuner. I bought the Snark SN-6 Uku tuner. It's awesome too."
30,847,4.0,"First off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to: it holds your guitar.  One thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus.  I use it for my Mitchell Acoustic and it holds it perfectly.About the effects on finish.  After Googling it, calling where I purchased my guitar, and reading the little tag on the stand, the foam on this and many other stands may affect &#34;Nitro Cellulous Laquer Finishes.&#34;  How do you know if you have this finish? Basically the value of your guitar and/or the age.  This finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions. It is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars.  It is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at GC told me."

1102,847,0.0,This is a cheap stand and I was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived. The top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made. I do not recommend this product.

955,469,3.0,"I've been searching for the 'perfect' capo for years now and this one's come the closest so far.The capo's well made and doesn't show any manufacturing flaws at all. As delivered, the capo fits the neck of my Taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension. Some other capos are horrible to attach and grip the neck so hard, I'm afraid it'll dent the fretboard. The Planet Waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profile.I like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around. Nothing's worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple.It comes with a clip to hold a pick, but it's kind of hard to slip one in, especially with some picks I use.Overall, I think this capo's a winner. It's easy to put on and take off. There's no buzzing and it stays out of my way when I'm playing. That's all I ask for :)"
89,469,4.0,"I have been playing guitar for longer than I care to admit. Back in 1966 I went into the music store with my Dad and cherry picked the finest Fender Telecaster in the whole store. Back then they were all handmade, so there were variations, and by spending some time, would yield you an incredible find. So I am not a newbie to playing, or working on guitars. I didn't use this capo on my 66 because I have it apart in order to make exact vintage reproductions of the body.Today's modern guitars use medium jumbo frets. My 66 had thin frets. With the medium jumbo frets they are sufficiently high, that if you check them once fretting a note with something as accurate as the Snark SN 2 All Instrument Clip on Chromatic Tuner you will see that the note moves up one or two bars on the tuner once you fret it. (That is one or two bar above the note you are then fretting) So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enable me to adjust it so that the guitar doesn't go out of tune when using a capo.I compared the G7 Performance Capo the Six String Silver, with the Schubb S1 Stainless Steel Guitar Capo for Steel String Guitars, and this Planet Waves NS-Tri-action capo. Although the G7 was substantially built and looked rather impressive, I found it to be too bulky, so it kept getting in the way while trying to play chords. So I sent it back. So now it comes down to the Shubb 1 Deluxe and the Planet Waves. I went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times. I would perfectly tune the guitar with the Snark and then apply the capo. I tried to discern the difference between which one of these would make the guitar go out of tune more than the other. I finally concluded that there was no difference.The Schubb S1 had the ability to be adjusted so fine that it would barely be holding on to the neck. If you set that one at its gentlest setting you could get it to be almost perfectly in tune even with the capo on, but set it that softly, and it would just about fall off the guitar. So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance. The Planet Waves Capo in contrast, even at the lightest setting, was still a solid grip on the neck. I also noticed that the planet waves had a wider spread across the strings and therefore was less critical of the positioning in order to get it right.The Schubb S1 is a well-made product, it has nicely finished metal components, but with its roller ball system of fastening, when you loosen it, for sure you're going to occasionally be dropping it in on the floor. You could say that requires two hands in order to remove it. The Planet Wave on the other hand is a true one-handed tool that makes it easy to remove and to put back on. I tried both of these on one of my other Fender telecasters, as well as on one of my acoustics. I got the same tuning results on all of them. I am very critical and exact so when I say that the tuning results would change when you put on the capo you must understand, that the tuner was only moving one line. Most people wouldn't even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it, and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune; perfect harmony rules. You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song, and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune; there is nothing to compare to it.The planet wave is a little bit bulkier and if I had to get critical of it I would say it does get in the way a tiny bit more than the Schubb S1; although this factor is not such a great difference, as to preclude me choosing one over the other. The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet Waves.I saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo. Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of. There are so many factors affecting the tone, such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way, then it was the last time. For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that might've been projecting more from the side of the guitar. I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge. So at least between these two I found no total differences.I wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch. I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings. I'd rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings. To each his own they say. I just consider it important to let you know that I'm conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic. So if you're running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo. (Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead.) Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it won't slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting.Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position. That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position. I'm sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesn't impede the overall quality of their performance. I find on the other hand, that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tune.So I conclusion I find the planet waves easier-to-use and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board, while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well, as being the one that I highly recommend. Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second, and with its slightly smaller size, it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves. All in all they both are the best of all the ones I've tried."
849,469,4.0,"This Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo is easy to use, and features a micrometer adjustment knob to custom fit the capo to your specific guitar neck, a feature I've never seen on a capo before. It worked excellently on several guitars I tried it on (all with light/extra light guage strings), with no fret buzz or noticeable detuning after removal. The pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too.I recommend this capo without reservation."
341,469,4.0,"Knowing nothing about guitars except that my husband plays one, I got this for my other half.He was very happy with it, said it was an excellent quality capo, only needing a turn of knob to do what it needs to do.  He showed me how it worked; how it gives a different sound to the guitar, depending on where you position it.I would highly recommend this to you guitar players.  My husband is pretty picky about his guitar stuff, and I can assure you he was very satisfied with this capo!Highly recommended."
806,469,4.0,Capos are not something that I shop for. I have had two for years. One is a strap type and the other is an expensive K type. It is similar to this one. Yeah...in looks only. This one blows that one away. It has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner. It is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways. This is great. I play a Tele and an acoustic Martin. It works great on both. I play professionaly and this is the best thing I've gotten in two years.
133,469,4.0,"Having played guitar for 45 years, I have tried and used many, many capos. Back ""in the day,"" it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic. It didn't work very well but it is what was available to me. Later, some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place (and in tune) as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar WITHOUT doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar's neck. Many 'good' capos have been made. Until now, perhaps the best options have been G7 which fails in its 'softness' that allows strings to slip, and SCHUBB which, unfortunately, 'snaps' into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument.This new NS TRI-ACTION capo from Planet Waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively.Designed by Ned Steinberger (the ""NS""), the Tri-Action works on a trigger/spring/lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck, fits perfectly on the first attempt, holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar. Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known, more commonly used and more expensive. This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for. D'Addario, the famous string maker that produces the Planet Waves line of guitar accessories)has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos. Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other (capo) over time, searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time, will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six-string guitar."
1232,469,4.0,"Oh, quick note: this capo is meant for instruments with radiused, NOT flat, necks.  That said, it works fine on a non-radiused ukulele.I've been using only Kyser capos for many years now.  They don't fall off, they don't usually pull strings sharp, but they do grip TIGHT and can damage some finishes.This capo is easy on & easy off with the pistol grip, has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won't damage finishes, and has adjustable tension.  I backed off the tension as much as possible, set it on the neck, made one adjustment and it was perfect.  Since I can adjust the tension, I have no worries about it pulling strings sharp.I only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths! ;-)"
472,469,4.0,"To my mind there are three criteria for evaluating a capo:1) It's got to hold with enough even pressure to keep all the open stringsringing clearly, especially in the face of hard picking, strumming, and string pulling.2) The design shouldn't intrude on either my thumb when it's behind the neck or peeking over the fingerboard, or the side of my index finger when I'm at the first fret playing chords or single notes.3) The design shouldn't require excessive hand pressure or too much fussiness to apply, reposition, and remove the capo (especially two-handed fussiness).The Tri-Action capo scored big on all three criteria: It held tight on a variety of acoustic and electric neck widths and profiles, from a Martin OM-1 with a wide rounded shape to a Gibson L4 archtop with a baseball bat-thick and round neck, a skinny SG, a wide and soft C-profiled Ibanez Artist, and an imitation Strat with a hard-radiused fingerboard and classic C-shaped neck.Planet Waves came up with a design that works both ""over and under"": I can squeeze the capo with my fingers with its back snug in my palm or flip it over and use the base of my thumb, making it effortless to position, adjust and remove.The capo's profile is comparable in size to the Keyser, but without the Keyser's protruding high angle arm neccessary to generate adequate spring tension. I've used the Keyser for years and in my opinion the Tri-Action is far easier to apply.The Tri-Action is also much less conspicuous from the front, although it's not quite as compact as the Schubb or those fancy minimalist capos some flatpickers like (I like them too but they're a little more work than I sometimes want).What's remarkable about the Tri-Action is its spring tension that's truly comfortable to apply yet produces a more than adequate string grip. The spring wire is probably 1/16"" thick and I can't imagine it ever losing its tension. The adjusting screw wheel is about a quater-inch wide and textured for an easy touch.The purpose of the tension wheel is not to vary the distance between front and rear capo surfaces, as is the case with some other brands, but to vary the pressure exerted by the rear surface against the neck - and consequently the amount of pressure required to squeeze the capo. The bottom line is you can custom-fit the capo to your hand strength and avoid straining or worse - a painful palm cramp like the one I got on stage once while squeezing the Keyser.The pick holder is also nicely designed: a kind of serrated slit that lets you securely stash a pick at varying depths, equating to how easy it is to pull it out. I think my pockets serve the same purpose even more securely, but it's a nice touch.I didn't think there was a whole lot of room left for re-engineering the largely utilitarian guitar capo, but clearly a lot of thought went into Planet Waves' NS Tri-Action Capo - enough to easily knock my previous go-to capo right off its pedestal.Get one, and sit back and watch the banjo guys sweat when the fiddler calls for ""Done Gone"" in Bb at that next jam session."
809,469,4.0,"I use a variety of guitars, from an old '50s gibson acoustic to a new nylon string acoustic. I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2-inch nut width guitars as well. It has a spring-loaded clamping arm that can have the clamping strength increased or decreased, and this works well. Above the adjustable clamping device is a narrow slit to hold a guitar pick, and there's also a holder for a tuner. I use neither of these, so I have no comment on their usability. But for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered, and is an excellent product."
269,469,4.0,"For years I have used a kyser capo because I like the trigger action.  I have run into a few issues when switching between my 6 to 12 string guitar.  I haven't used it much on my electrics.  Though  I like the kyser, the planet waves tri-action is super slick.  It is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open.  The trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser.  A few twist to adjust it and I can easily capo between my 6 or 12 string without any problem.  Light, easy and quick.  I am now a believer.  I'm switching to the planet tri-action.  It is definitely worth the few extra bucks."
804,469,4.0,"NS (Ned Steinburger) Capo is different than your traditional Kyser style capo. I really like how it is designed, where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos I have used. It boasts minimal string bending across the frets, where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck. I tried this out and, sure enough, their claim was true. I capo'ed from the 1st fret up to the 10th (where I would actually never use it) and tuning stayed pretty much accurate. There is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in, just in case you drop the one in your hand. Overall, this is a great product and I give it a high recommendation and five stars."
1378,469,4.0,"I've been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years.  I've learned this...if you are a serious guitar player there are many ""must-have"" items you need in your arsenal.  One of them is a capo.  By clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in.  Essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device.  They are quite common, inexpensive and the basic design really hasn't changed in many years...until now.That's where this product comes in.  This capo is great because it doesn't simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down.  It has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob.  The reason this matters is because, depending on the guitar, sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension (or not enough) when clamped.  Too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch.  Not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes.  Either one is not good.  This new capo eliminates that in an efficient, effective and economical manner.  I highly recommend."
1409,469,3.0,"While I haven't used a lot of capos in my playing, I have used 4 or 5 different types, and this is easily the best of that batch.While all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar, this one was pretty easy to ""dial in."" I had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuning.The action of the grip and release mechanism is easy, but it delivers firm pressure to the strings. In fact, the only negative I found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chords.Overall, this is a very good capo, and I can recommend it without hesitation."
4,469,4.0,"Can't say I've tried all of the capos in the world, but I've had my share of the different designs.First I had the bungee cord type, then I had the snap on type, then I had the different capos designed for acoustic, or classical or electrical.This one by far, evolved from good design.The bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly. The top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings.  The spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension.The design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck. All of the others I have tried use a spring that could pop out (one actually did) and the entire capo came apart.This one even has a pick holder built in.It is light weight, just the right size.I highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar."
1123,469,4.0,"I've had my eye on a G7th capo for awhile, but this became available in the Vine program so I decided to try it.The capo was easy to pop out of the package. The design is simple and easy to understand and use. It is very lightweight and works fine on my Epiphone electric guitar. The capo also has a handy built-in pick holder.This capo certainly meets my needs, and I've removed the G7th from my wish list."
410,469,3.0,"I like the adjustable tension of this capo, I don't think its as easy to put on a ""Kyser"" capo of this style, but once on the neck, the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo moves easily, and has even pressure across the fingerboard, a result of the adjustable tension I surmise. Some day I will use the pick holder, not right away, some night when I'm feeling I need my pick held."
990,469,4.0,"Over the years I've tried literally dozens of capos. While some have been better than others I've never had one I was completly happy with -string buzz, hard to place without being out of tune, too firm, not firm enough, etc. So far the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo is the best one I've ever tried,at least in the short term. It's worked equally well on my acoustic & my electric. It works on my octave mandolin and, even though it's designed for 6 strings, on my Rickenbacker 12 string. Hopefully it will give years of faithful service & for the quality is reasonably priced. At this point I give it 2 thumbs up. Recommended"
16,469,4.0,"I've been playing guitar for about 7 years now, and I've always used the Kaiser capo, but since I got this planet waves one, the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case. Although they're both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret, the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort, while I can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar. Less pressure is involved, and I kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo, that isn't actually barring down the frets, is under the guitar instead of over it. The product conceals itself well to those who aren't playing the instrument and it has great use. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there."
1047,469,4.0,"I have been using an old elastic-bar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension. When I first applied the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo I thought ""here we go again."" There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out. Not expecting much, I adjusted the tension. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar... zero buzz across the board. That in and of itself, makes this capo a five in my book. Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze (on and off), it looks nice (I have the black version), as well as its comparative ease on the wallet, and this capo is a rock solid five star product.This capo also has a pick holder. The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo's overall size and shape, but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself.Get this capo!"
1385,469,4.0,"I have several capos & this one really surprised me for the price. It's light-weight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck. Compared to my G7th which costs 3 times more, it is a great buy. I really like Planet Waves products. They are made well & last."
386,469,4.0,"I'm a HUGE fan of the two previous NS Capos from Planet Waves. What does this add to the others?Well, functionally I think it works no better than the previous dual action capo. In other words. It's freakin' perfect.So... I'd give it 4 stars... except it gets 5... because...That little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius.Full marks. You can't miss with this product."
819,469,3.0,"As a musician, you wonder how accessories like a capo, which have been around for centuries, can be improved. Sure enough, the Planet Waves' Capo has a feature where you can manually adjust the tension. When a capo doesn't have enough tension, it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing. Initially, the Planet Waves' Capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first. I mean shouldn't it just immediately work? After I figured out what worked best for my instrument, the capo worked like a charm. An additional feature of the Planet Waves' Capo is that there is a clip for a pick which is handy if you don't already have an attached pick holder.I like it and recommend it for those who might move their capo around to different instruments that have varying neck dimensions."
1374,469,3.0,"This capo works just fine. The only downside is the same as with most capos...it requires some fine-tuning to get it work on different guitars. The only one I've found that doesn't is the Kyser...my ""go to"" capo for years. Because of its design, that capo adjusts to any guitar (acoustic vs. electric, thin neck vs thick, etc) easily. The only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of use.This capo has a similar ""pinch"" design (spring-loaded), but doesn't adjust as easily to different guitar/neck sizes. It has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs. This allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation, but at the expense of ease of use. It's certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming, but it's not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songs.So, all said, I still prefer my Kyser. It allows for much faster changing, which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy. But this might be a better option if you're in a studio or won't ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time (or don't plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place)."
303,469,3.0,"I did some research on capos and decided to give Planet Waves a try. I previously had one of those bungie cord like capos, which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome.The other capos I looked into were Kyser and Schubb. Kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip. It's disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune. The Schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck. The problem with the Schubb, however, is that it can't really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar.In comes the Planet Waves. It has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard. However, because of the adjustable tension, you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness. It might rule out the one-handed ease but it does take care of Schubb's problem of falling off. In reality, I only found that I need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if I move up way up the fretboard. Between the 1st and 5th fret, I don't really need adjust. However, if for some reason I want to capo at the 7th, I do need to adjust the tension because it's too tight. In all, it's not that big a deal and it's nice to have the option to adjust the capo.In all, I'm happy. No capo is perfect. You can do partial capos with this one. Another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension.In case you aren't aware, this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars. I have an electric guitar, a nylon and a Recording King ROS-06 with a chunky neck. Works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ROS-06 with that chunky neck. Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard, it does not work on classical guitars (or anything with a flat fretboard). The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved, it will not apply pressure on the middle strings.It's a nice capo but it may not be what you're looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos."
686,469,4.0,"I am a long-time musician who has been through a lot of capos; some that I hope to never see again :) ... fortunately, things have changed for the better ...What serious guitar players have always needed is a capo that is smart and small, durable, quick change, one hand operation that also has the right tension to make sure there is no string buzz or detuning ... for a while, you could get quick change or tension adjusment, but not both in the same capo ... the last several years have seen manufacturers attempting to provide these key features in one acceptable capo ... now there are many choices out there at various price points and frankly, it gets confusing ...So why this particular capo?  First Planets Waves is a name I have come to trust to provide quality accessories at reasonable prices ... this NS Tri-Action Capo is built sturdy but it is very light and unobtrusive on the guitar neck ... one-hand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner ... so far, this capo covers all the bases in a simple design as well or better than anything else I've tried for the price ...One thing I did not expect is that, because of the design and tensioning, I can use it on Tenor Guitar, Banjo and Mandolin as well ... while I prefer a smaller capo for these other instruments, in a pinch, I can just clip on the NS Tri-Action and keep playing ...I am the kind of guy that when I find something in the instrument world that works, I stick with it for years ... it is possible that this capo may become my favorite ... I just really like the look, feel and features of this smart design ... looks like Planet Waves hit the mark once more ..."
622,469,4.0,This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune. Adjustment is easy and effective. The same company makes a tuning capo which I find handy at times.
1193,282,4.0,"When I'm in a apt. I need an amp with tube (at least the pre) and a cabinetOrange PPC108 1x8"" Speaker Cabinetas small as possible, giving a decent sound and output (w/o annoying around) and Orange made my needs true!(I never ever expect to play at a stadium with this! Obviously)In my opinion, this is absolutely a decent Amp that respond to precise needs."
1232,282,3.0,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy."
352,282,2.0,"BOTTOM LINE: The Orange Micro Terror is powerful hybrid amp head capable of driving any number of speakers you throw at it. It's low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your hand.WHY ONLY 3 STARS? For starters, this is what I would consider a ""novelty-boutique amplifier"", because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss, but it's lack of clean headroom is evident. It's an Orange after all, and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1-channel to work with - this head is for you. Playing with a Les Paul, I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing. I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30. I was able to find the ""sweet spot"" on the Tone knob, which for me was around 1 o'clock, and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max... I had entered a very musical, lush, and totally gig-worthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with. However, as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we're starting at 5 stars) I have to subtract one star. I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesn't exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise, which leads to feedback. I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if you're in a rock band, already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and want something quick and small to use to rock out with. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse. This leads me to my final point: if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple (but GREAT) one.WHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal. Having owned several different combo amps and head/cabinet variations over the years, the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I were starting over from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed. This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert stage venues.(TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL: I've noticed this review, and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes. It seems like, people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the caveat of ""but it's $150, what do you expect?"" or they begin their rave review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I don't judge gear just by price, I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing. If you're dropping $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150~$250 for a great cab... why not spend that $300 or so on a great ALL-tube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels, better EQ, and the option to route to an external cab from the get-go?)"
1136,282,4.0,"Will be getting the amp in a day or two. At the sale price of $119 this can't be beat. My research on this device said that to make the really good little solid state/tube hybrid even more awesome is to replace the JJ 12AX7 with a Mullard Blackburn vintage 12AX7 (from the 1960's). It can cost around $30-50 a piece for a NOS (new old stock) but will sweeten the sound without adding or subtracting noticeable gain. In the end the Micro Terror should sound just like real tube amps costing many hundreds more.1st UpdateTook delivery and hooked it right up to my Marschall 412 into the 16 Ohm jack. Volume at about8 o'clock and gain at about 3 o'clock. Man, what a great sound. Very tubey! Typical British growl at higher gain settings. Loud. Plenty loud for your bedroom/office/whatever. Turning it up a bit should be more than enough for a gig at a bar. Just be sure to use a GOOD QUALITY SPEAKER CABLE, like the GLS. Will be updating when I get the vintage 12AX7 tube replacement. So far I am very impressed. Honestly, with a sound this good, why buy a TH30 for 5 times the price. Measured how loud this thing is. At about 3 feet in front of my Marshall 1960 lead 4x12 with gain at max and volume at a bit less than 8 o'clock I got around 84 decibels playing strong but not super strong chords. This is too loud for most apt. buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones.2nd UpdateTried out several compatible tubes...ie 12AY7 12AT7 and the Mullard 12AX7. Each will have a subtle or more obvious effect, sound is such a subjective thing you really have to try this out for yourself.  I personally found the Mullard to be the best. Really nice tube sound, typical Orange, sounds as good as most amps costing several times as much."
1275,282,2.0,"This is a very cheap little practice amp, and I hoped I'd be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my GF nuts... Unfortunately I have a couple of problems:  the headphone and aux quality really wasn't that great (and using great phones).  The sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier... I just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be.For quiet practice, you're best getting a VOX Amplug, IMHO.  Sounds great, MUCH cheaper, and integrates external audio better."
1138,824,4.0,"A perfect fit! Plus it comes with a handle, strap and a nice sized pocket where you can store picks, capos, straps and strings. Its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely. Would recommend it."
462,824,4.0,Very happy with it considering the price point.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you don't need a hard case.  Great for the knock around uke though.
163,824,4.0,"This is a very sturdy and well-made bag. Much better for the money than I was expecting. I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice! My uke is very cozy inside. The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks, kazoo, ukulele stand, whatever you need to have with you.I carry an iPad around when I play -- the full size iPad doesn't fit in the outer pocket, so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside. An iPad Mini would probably fit."
789,458,3.0,Inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners. Angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well.
449,458,4.0,This is so darn cool!! It shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune!! And it works on so many instruments!!
662,458,4.0,"I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar."
660,458,4.0,"I bought this on a whim to use as a low cost tuner for my Hola! uke...and find myself using it on my six string guitar and four string bass as well. It tunes quickly and easily, with different colors used for when your too high or too low in pitch, and uses green as the color when you nail it, very nice and easy to use. It's also very compact, easily storing in even the tightest of gig bags, even your pants pocket will do for traveling.I highly recommend this if your on a tight budget and can only get one tuner for multiple instruments, it's a bargain and it works great. You can't honestly ask for more!"
768,458,4.0,"I love this little tuner. It is smaller than I thought it would be. It weighs next to nothing, is accurate,  and easy to read with its bright large display. It is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back. The only part of the display that is very small is the one that tells you what instrument it is set for, but that was not a big enough issue for me to subtract points for."
1345,458,3.0,"I've ordered 9 of these, and only one has been defective. Not worth shipping it back, no big deal. Great tuner for my guitar class! The Snark may have a few more features, but if all you need this to do is help you tune, you're good to go."
103,458,4.0,"Liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as I must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes,, I bought another for my step son.  I did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re-seating the battery it has not had a problem since."
511,857,4.0,"This 6-Pack of Guitar Patch Cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable ""spaghetti mess"". These are well made cables with 90-degree connectors, which is exactly what we needed.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1105,857,4.0,"After years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths, I love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in. Some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered 90 degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time - may be due to vibration when packing / setting up or, maybe it's just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface. No matter, I won't be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again.One advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size - especially when connecting stereo devices. Much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws. A couple of concerns I had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length. As it turns out, they don't contribute to higher noise levels and, they are just the right length for all my pedal connections. Everything is connected using this single length patch.Love the color coding, too. Especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and B channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light.And what to do if one does fail? Toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature. I'll always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board. It's a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff - love these patch cables!"
362,857,2.0,These patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like band-aids ... kind of a gross plastic smell.  The smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first.
310,720,4.0,"If you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it.  I've tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer.  It is great for a quick way to get electrified.  Lead wire is not very substantial, but if it breaks in the future hopefully I can just buy another one.  To get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp."
71,720,4.0,"For being so cheap, this pickup works surprisingly great. Was just looking for something quick and easy to mic a violin at a decent quality, and this did the job perfectly!"
695,720,4.0,"I wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin. It sounds pretty good for the price I paid for it. I was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping Amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic. I purchased it at the same time I bought the electric violin. Naturally when the electric arrived, I laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric. A few days later I thought I would give the pickup a try. It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem. I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out. It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall. Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp. Whatever your amp is capable of, your violin can do it. Now I haven't tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous. Cant say enough except the price was so low I couldn't have gone wrong too bad."
794,720,2.0,"Pros:-Price point--can't really go wrong-Clean signal (no self-noise)-Works for a tunerCons:-For recording or amplification purposes, this thing picks up a LOT of attack noise--fingers dropping on the strings, bow clicks, etc.-Additionally, the clamp does not always solidly grasp the instrument, and shakes around a bit. God help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified."
1282,720,4.0,"For an $8 item, you can't go wrong. I used it on a violin to test out some amps at a Guitar Center. It seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone."
408,720,2.0,"I originally rated this pickup 5 stars. However after using it for some time on dulcimers, a mandolin and acoustic guitars, some problems have turned up.Basically the Cherub is just too sensitive. It works well at lower volumes, but as soon as you crank it up, feedback city that you can not stop easily. I put a rubber inner tube from a bike to reduce the sensitivity, but still feed back and funny sound.If you are looking for a pickup to use at a dance or some other loud venue, the Cherub will likely squeal as you crank it up.It sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup. You can talk into your instrument!"
1365,720,3.0,"I quite like the sound of this thing, running through a Crate acoustic guitar amplifier. It sounds really natural, and it's easy to dial in a nice sound. It's hard to hear it while you're playing; you're better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you, or trusting someone else to set the amp. Like most of these kinds of pickups, it's quite susceptible to feedback, so you can't get out in front of the amplifier and listen. Not a slam on the product-that's just the nature of the beast. I'm an honest to goodness terrible violinist, but I got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children. It's a beginner class, and hearing the right sound is really helpful. It works great. I don't turn it up very loud-just a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room. I hate the &#34;short&#34; cord, and I wish I could use a regular instrument cable, but I can understand that they don't want a lot of weight pulling on your violin. But the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifier-unless you use some kind of little pre amp. In fairness, the cord is a reasonable length, but I'm quite tall, so it's 5' of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder."
559,720,3.0,Unbelievable clear sounding on a Mandolin.  Can't yet get the sound out of a violin that I want with it but still experimenting.  Will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it's connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise.All in all 7$ very well spent.  Thank goodness pickup prices are coming down.  Only a few years ago you could not find a pickup-mic even this good for &#60;100$.  Now if only the price of pickup-chics would come down. :(
152,698,4.0,"I have run sound for several large churches, providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting. The way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different, especially when applying vocal effects. I have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years.The 80/20 rule says that if you can get 80% of the sound you're looking for with 20% of the work, be satisfied. This Mic Mechanic (MM) is more like 99% of the sound with 1% of the work.I actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound. Primarily because it solves SO many problems that you face as a sound engineer.1) Adaptive tone. The MM continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression, gate, EQ, and de-essing. Even when recording dry vocals, at a minimum, you should at least set your compression, then in post production, add parametric EQ to place your vocals where they need to be set.Now? I hit the tone button, and all that is done for me. It makes a dynamic mic sound great! It makes working with a condenser mic easier.2) Reverb. Most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb. They either use too much or too little. With this, when you it equally between wet and dry, you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life. I recorded a vocal with club, room, and hall reverb. Each one sat just right! When you solo the vocals, you can tell which is used. In the mix it was more subtle. Good Job!3) Pitch correction. I have to admit, my own vocals aren't perfect. When you record your own vocals, and you're like me, you'll hear a ""chorus"" sound in your headphones. That's because you're hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones. This takes a second to get use to.When set in the center, you can still do your vocal gymnastics, slide into notes, and it seems... natural. It pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale, so if you're way off, it will make your vocals sound out.I'm not a singer, but this has renewed my joy in singing!"
1402,698,4.0,"I have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar. This little device gives me auto-correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren't overbearing, and the pitch correction sounds really natural. Now I just need 2 more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound."
1134,698,4.0,"I have a small format 10 channel mixer for my acoustic and small gigs and it has no built in effects. It also gets a little bit noisy when using the EQ on the two mic pre channels.The Mic Mechanic allows me to dial in foot switchable effects right on y pedalboard, where they should be for a solo act or when your running your own sound. I typically leave the &#34;Tone&#34; button on at all times, as it gives a nice eq curve and mild compression. Effects are easy dial up on the selector and can be customized by using the modifiers...(read the manual). The correction works pretty well for me, but someone who is a bett vocalist may not need it, in which case, you can turn it down. I typically run mine around 12-1:00E thing I don't like about this pedal is its 12v power consumption. It can be phantom powered, but if I engage phantom power on my mixer it is on for both mic pres And I use the other often times for a second dynamic mic when playing as a duo. It can run off the Sanyo Pedal Power without issue however and I often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delay/reverb for my guitar."
95,698,1.0,"When I originally went out to place this order, I was planning to order the  TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function. As I looked over that device and some alternatives, I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the &#34;Mic Mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? Well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT! Also, I couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects, but I'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it!"
516,698,4.0,"I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisy-chainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained for.The effects are beautifully done. Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo. For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position. Wet means more of the effect and dry means less.There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit, and the mic input (XLR only) has phantom power. The XLR out goes straight to your mixer. There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that feature.The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature, which I leave on. It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them, not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction. I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive. It's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small, bare-bones PA systems. It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA."
631,640,4.0,"This is the best octaver I have ever played through (I bought my first one in 1980), and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive. THREE umm... density/timbral/tonal choices [chorused, only octaved signal, 50/50 mix clean-octaved signal] PER setting, which ranges from -2 to +2 octaves. Quiet and tiny footprint. You'd be dumb not to get one while they're cheap."
1268,640,3.0,"I have owned almost every octave/harmonizer/pitch shifter on the market. For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of, you cant beat it. First off, Its polyphonic. You wont find that in anything else under $300. Instant tracking, wide range of versatility, perfect volume balancing and very solid design. Only two flaws: a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals, still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did. The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode. Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day. Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam. Great job Mooer, i cant wait to try more of your stuff."
775,640,0.0,"If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that.  As an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful.  All the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect.  I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it.  It's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is.  I've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also. This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good.  I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals.  It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I've tried to use."
1301,230,4.0,"I ordered TM50BK unit but after a couple of delays with my local delivery agent, decided to buy a unit locally which turned out to be the Korg Beat Boy.The Beat Boy is everything that this unit is and then some. In addition to the metronome and tuner, it has a record function and drum tracks, in all 100 different patterns. The units have an almost identical front panel with the metronome patterns in with the drum options, the extra buttons for the record and an external mic for acoustic instruments.Had I seen the Beat Boy first, I would have ordered it instead as I was looking for a drum machine anyway. The functions which are shared between the 2 units work really well, the tuner is accurate and fast, and can't fault the metronome.I will probably keep the TM50BK as a spare, but I'm also glad my local shippers have prolonged the wait. If you just want a metronome and tuner, this is a fine unit, but if you're considering a drum machine too, look at the Beat Boy before making any decisions."
935,230,4.0,"I started to play the violin a few months ago.  When I got my violin, I purchased the Korg CA1 Chromatic Tuner thinking I would not need a metronome.  The Korg CA1 also cost slight less.  However, now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome.  She has the Korg TM40 metronome.  I opted to purchase the newer model Korg TM50PW Instrument Tuner and Metronome.  It is great.  Based on my experience, unless you are sure you do not need a metronome, I would recommend everyone purchased the TM40 or TM50 (just in case) instead of the CA1."
521,230,4.0,"I play using this device. It is portable, so I always have it with me. I tune the A to 432, and this works well for that. Has a tuner and a metronome. What's not to love. Best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar, unless you are in a quiet area. It is sensitive, and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings. This is a good thing: it's sensitive."
692,696,3.0,"So ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now. Ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that I noticed consistently, so beware of this.One channel (#8) does 9v with 500mA, sounds great right?I plug in my Even Tide Timefactor and works great by itself. Once I added other pedals, there became a horrible hum. Like noticable and just horrible. Then I used my stock Timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing 500mA from output 8, and there was no hum.This phenomena also occured when I plugged in my Holy Grail pedal (the classic one) that draws 500mA as well.kind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal, but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp2+, to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot."
345,696,3.0,"This isn't the best power supply available. It doesn't truly isolate each input. The description says the outputs are &#34;isolated,&#34; but what this means is that they are independent; that is, if one input has a short in it, that one will cease to function and not the other, working inputs. So the short circuit protection is isolated, but the grounding is not.This can cause some issues with noise, but there are other things that can cause noise too. It's not always just the power supply making the noise. It could be certain pedals, cables, or some combination of factors. A power conditioner will sometimes help as well.However, the Joyo provides plenty of power--enough for 8-9V inputs and 1 each of 12V and 18V.It is dependable, solidly built, comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards. I have 12 5 x 3 pedals on my board with 2 of these Joyo units, and my board is about 26 x 14.There is some noise, but I don't attribute that just to the power supply. It takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down. I'm not sure it can ever be completely eliminated, but the Joyo itself seems to produce very little, and it's a third to half the price of the truly isolated units, and a definite step up from a daisy chain. It also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off."
281,696,4.0,"Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others.  This is not true isolated outputs, but it is quiet and that is what counts.  I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best, mainly because of the 500ma output. Here is a comparison of the JP-02, Chameleon, and the OneSpot.  I have all three.T-REX FUEL TANK CHAMELEON (1350ma)Outputs 1-3: 9v/12v 300maOutput 4: 9v/18V 150maOutput 5: 9v/12v 300ma| ---- Use 5 OR 6 only, not bothOutput 6: 12v AC 300maJOYO SP-02 (1000ma)Outputs 1-7: 9v 100maOutput 8: DC 9V Maximum output of 500mAOutput 9: DC12V 100maOutput 10: DC18V 100maVISUAL SOUND ONESPOT (1700ma 9v only)Daisy Chain Power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma"
1335,696,3.0,"I like this power supply, but I wish that the LED's only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to, so for that reason I'll give it 4 stars as opposed to 5. The quantity of power outlets and the amperage's that it provides are best in class."
79,696,4.0,"So far this power supply is great! Pretty compact and light, come with all the power cables you need and does the job at a far more reasonable price at the other power supplies I was considering. No complaints here!"
944,696,4.0,joyo makes great quality products  cheap. I love this product it works great. all my pedals hove there own power supply
848,696,3.0,"I've read its not really complete isolated, but it does the job. I didn't realise how much noise my one spot was adding. I A/B them both one after the other and it truly was quieter. the only Problem I have is my TC Helicon takes 12 volts input but 300MA. this pedal only supplies 100MA so the pedal didn't work in the 12 volt slit. Luckily however it does work plugged into the 9volt 300MA spot so im using it there. everything else in the other 9volt 100MA slots.it's a lot quieter now. I recommend trying it and saving some cash."
1343,696,4.0,"I admit I haven't had it long, but so far so good. I have a Gator pedal board that came with their power supply. Unfortunately, that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable. The PS is fine, but the cable is shorting out. Couldn't find another cable, so I thought I'd find another solution with a more generic cable. This Joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition (which made me a little skeptical). I may never need all its features, but for what I need (powering 5 devices) it is doing the job beautifully. My pedal board includes tuner, chorus and octaver stomp boxes, a bass DI and a Rolls headphone amp. The JP-02 frees me up from any other wall warts. Money! Now I just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board."
1376,318,4.0,"Ordered a set of these to put 2 on my Ibanez and 2 on my Squier, they fit perfectly. Highly recommended."
1065,318,3.0,"If you are ordering these to replace one or two of your Gibson Speed knobs, you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to Gibson's.In all fairness, these could possibly be BETTER than Gibson's stock, seem to be made with a more solid underside, but the numbers are a little bit smaller.This is the only reason I gave them four stars.Fit perfectly on CTS potentiometers and if you replace all four of them, nobody except you will know! -lol.All four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects, as opposed to other reviews.If you get these and they aren't perfect...send them back until you get a perfect set! It's free!Hope this helps...not much else to say!"
1301,318,4.0,"Not much you can say about these, they're knobs! They fit perfectly and are of high quality finish. They finish off my bass nicely as I like to have the numerals there for reference."
160,376,4.0,I have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work. Focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this. I have only made a few recording but I am going to make a lot more. Very easy to use.
1147,376,4.0,"I wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig, or just in my office. I did a LOT of research into devices that were USB only, even other ones that Focusrite sold. The main reason I picked this one was its versatility in being both iPad and USB compatible.The complaints about the iPad connector cable are valid - it's too stiff and short. I feel like I might accidently break it off if I'm not too careful. Why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit, I'll never know. To combat the included 30-pin cable I bought a$10 3ft 30-pin extension cable, which seems to do the job nicely. The GarageBand software on the iPad is simple enough to use, and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time, that's fine for what I expected. To record from a live sound-board, I just use the XLR input, set the gain (with the awesome colored halo ring), and save the recording as a mono track.Being small and solidly built, I've got no problem tossing this in the milk-crate with the rest of my cables and peddles.In regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via USB (an iMac in this case), it's even better than I expected. The GarageBand software on the Mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time. The on-board monitor volume and headphone is fantastic. I thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment, but it does more than that. It's a real monitor (the GarageBand software recognizes it's the monitor output), and when you have a multi-track recording that you're working on, the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new track.For example, I recorded a track with just the guitar (track 1), I was using the 1/4"" input channel, and laid down that track. Then I created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part (headphones plugged into iTrack Solo) and I was able to hear both the current track I was recording, and the first track. Lastly, I plugged in a mic into the first input, and created a 3rd vocal only track. When I was singing, I was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the iTrack Solo as well as my vocals recording in real-time. I wasn't expecting this level of capability, and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals I was recording with all 3 going at the same time.The last thing I want to mention is the XLR pre-amp. Focusrite has been making high-end professional recording equipment for a long time, and the thing they're most well-known for is the mic pre-amp. I have to say, it is spectacular. There is absolutely no noise (no hiss, or clicks) of any kind. The gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup, it's almost too easy. The sound it captures is exactly what you expect, and you'll notice right away if you're using a low quality microphone. It definitely stands up to their reputation. Having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have. The demos on their website show how simple it is to use. Once you start playing with it, you'll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist, or someone who wants high portability, but great sound quality."
584,376,4.0,"Despite its iFlavor it works beautifully with my PC. Sounds better than any sound card i've used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency. It's a great intro model, not just for ipads. Whole device is powered and runs over one USB cord. I'm so impressed, my main PC audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device. It's an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with REAPER."
1365,376,3.0,"I bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program. (I'm a teacher, not a student.) I have only used it with Garage Band, but it works really well. I have used it to record electronic drums, bass guitar (direct out from a multi-effects pedal), vocals, and guitar (with garage band's virtual amps.) I've been very impressed. If you really turn up the gain, you will start to get a lot of noise, but the noise comes well AFTER you get past the point that any reasonable signal is &#34;clipping&#34;-making the light turn red. So, with the gain at 1/3 or so of the way up, you get good clean signal with little to no noise. The cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short. I bought 2 of the same Ziotek extension cable-at the recommendation of Focusrite. One worked, the other didn't. So, yeah, best of luck with that. Focusrite should really have made a longer cable. It gets in the way of the USB power plug a little bit, and makes things awkward. Other than that, I like it a lot."
1210,171,4.0,This music package by Led Zepplin is historical and put together well. Great for any Zep fan. Great audio and video. I especially liked the unreleased version of For Your Life!
823,171,4.0,"What else can be said that isn't implied in the title of this review? Not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who don't want to purchase the items separately. My only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was 5 years ago. That and the fact they didn't play more songs but who can blame them, their catalog is  almost endless (one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality)."
1111,171,4.0,"I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this (I saw it in the theatre).  I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that.  I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened...but had no idea if this would be as good as all that.  Never fear, you need to see this film.  The guys prove that the hype was legit.  I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like ""For Your Life"" even if the performances of ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Stairway"" seemed a little pedestrian.  But hey, it's LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99% of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance?  The show seems to get better as it goes along, and by the time ""Kashmir"" comes on I had tears in my eyes.  No joke.  This show is riveting.  I bought the Blu-Ray so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show, which really defies description.  I am not sure if non-LZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is, or what the band accomplished in doing this.  They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event.  Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70's.  If you love LZ you probably already have this set, if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one-night-only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era.  It's pretty awesome."
275,171,4.0,"I love the performances and sound production quality of Celebration Day! The band's on fire and Jason Bonham did a incredible job. A must buy for the Zep fan I can highly recommend this.To rehearse that long for this one show it's a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts. With Jason doing so well it was possible I could easily imagine NY, SF, Rio, Paris, Rom, Tokyo etc"
804,745,4.0,"The Flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible Delay pedal. I got this through a third party seller on Amazon for under $200 new... a steal in my opinion. Having three settings is awesome since I will use them all in a set. Having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly. The toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website. It's simple to use my Galaxy to &#34;beam&#34; the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups - very cool technology, makes me feel like I'm on a guitar version of star trek. I can't say that I have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great. I am partial to the 2290 with modulation - very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus. The space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background, which coincides with the delay time - sounds great with a little overdrive added in.All in all, this is a great pedal and a purchase that I am totally happy with. It is by far the best delay pedal I have ever owned as well as being the most versatile. Five Stars from me!!!"
175,745,2.0,"First of all its huge... no., like really huge....But finally you get over that, but seriously, its huge.The three presets are what sets this apart, but this could have been so very much better... why?.the midi clock sync implementation is flawed..A. The midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable, particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on/off.B. To have a midi in, and not be able to midi sync/quantize the looper.. sigh...like really?.. This means you cant play with a drum machine, sampler, sequencer or play with anyone that does!So, while this offers some functionality above the Flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays (only one of which can be used at a time) and can be used as a basic looper (along with the delay defined by the knobs), The downside is a very large footprint.Therefore:BUY if you have the space and either need the three presets, or have neither a looper OR a delay.CONSIDER PASSING if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision... both are weak, after the fact, implementations"
281,745,4.0,"This is far more pedal than I need but what a fun pedal to have.  Just going through the presets was fun, but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner :)  The bad part about this pedal is that it is HUGE and will take up a lot of space on your board.  You have to be committed to dealy.  You'll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches.  I can't comment on the looper as I never used it."
83,745,4.0,"You can set up 3 delays configurations, what is a interesting option to use on stage. Tap function also helps a lot. All type of delays are sounds beatiful..."
1295,745,1.0,No manual.  You can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it's price.  I purchase such so I could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live.  Don't believe this is what it is mean't for.  A simple delay looper will suffice.  This can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs.
140,536,4.0,"Don't know why quality instruments don't come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement.  The next time you change your strings, check and see if your current nut is plastic.  If so, have a few of these on hand and re[place that nut.  You will hear the difference and they don't wear out like plastic.Just make certain you get the height correct so your action isn't too high.  Rule of thumb, grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height.  You can always remove more material but you can't put it back on...This is a quick, easy improvement.  I have bone on all of my guitars."
252,536,4.0,"I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one.I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds.Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated. My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!).For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade."
1307,281,4.0,"This will last a very long time due its sturdy construction. Two pieces, easy to set up in seconds. Great buy for the $. (...ONLY MINE WAS A 'HAMILTON')"
15,281,4.0,"Far better than any light weight chrome stand, this has guts!  Easily adjustible, knobs tighten easily and firmly.  Good height adjustment for sitting or standing.  Highly reccomend this stand!"
1098,281,4.0,This is a really nice music stand. I wasn't expecting it to be such high quality. I wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind. Definitely got what I wanted. The orange Gearlux logo looks pretty cool too. Buy it.
620,281,4.0,"Super sturdy, well built. What more can I say, it's a sheet stand."
1142,281,4.0,"This is a great stand and highly adjustable. Can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall. There was a review I read with negative comments about the design, claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off. Nonsense. There are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock-solid. Because it's lightweight and portable, I could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height. But this is a GREAT stand."
309,281,4.0,"solid good stand, it is decent quality and doesn't have any places that will break easily.  can take anywhere you want"
1274,184,4.0,"I wasn't expecting much from this case; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected. This case is sweet! I love the black and crome, it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth. If you need a case don't even think twice about, this is a great one at a great price."
224,184,3.0,"For the money, this is a great guitar case.  I bought it for a Silvertone SD10, which costs about $120.  The guitar fits it fine.  I use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it.  I don't think I would take it on an airline.  They destroy luggage, so I don't think it would fair well.  The compartment inside is large enough for picks, strings, capo and a strap with room to spare.  Mine opens and closes ok and the lock works. It is well worth the $60 I paid for it."
357,184,3.0,"it is a hardshell case, about what I expected, decent low end hardshell but serviceable. I wouldn't check in with an airline, I can lean on the top and push it in. for a little extra protection over a gig bag YES, don't put an amp on top of it in a van though."
1106,184,4.0,"Looked at a lot of cases most priced $90 or above.  Settled on this one because of price, reviews, and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit.  I have an Alvarez AD60 (dreadnaught style body) and it fits in this case nice and snug.  Solid, well padded, sturdy latches, and everything lines up.  Very happy with my purchase."
1082,184,4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for the protect my investment.  I tried purchasing a soft case that had the Seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar, it didn't.  It was way too short for my Seagull S-12 Coastline.  This is a sturdy case that looks good too."
556,676,4.0,Bought these as an extra set just in case I made a mistake when I was trying to cut down my nut and bridge. They are real bone and fit well on my Yamaha. Did not end up using them but will one day. Great product for the price.
18,676,4.0,This is real bone.  The length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar. It is just my luck that I have some sandpaper in my garage so I sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about 10 minutes of sanding.
140,676,4.0,"After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months, I finally took the advice of other consumers.  MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone.This guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was.  I did put a light set of D'addario strings that made a world of difference.I was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle.WOW, it really did make a huge difference.  This guitar is such a quality piece, especially for the money.  But, with the string and bone upgrades I can't imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic.  It changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar.  I am so happy with my changes.The high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep.  The sustain is a drastic improvement, each note lasting nicely into the next.  I am so pleased and excited with my guitar.If you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle.....change them, it's a very quick fix.  And find a nice set of strings."
629,676,4.0,"The saddle, after some minor rounding at the edges, fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my Takamine acoustic. I haven't replaced the nut yet, but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable. These are high quality parts, well worth the relatively small investment.Edit: I have since replaced the nut too, and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit, though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one. But the difference is negligible, and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort."
572,676,4.0,"for the price of 1 ( one) saddle at GCyou get 2 of these and the nut assembliesi keep them handy for guitar setup changesordered on Monday, arrived on thursday"
327,635,4.0,"[Now that the SN-13 is about the same price as an SN-8, I've changed the comment about the price differential.]The SN-13 is another great Snark chromatic tuner with a Super Tight display. However, the black SN-8 adds a tap tempo metronome and the ability to set the tuner a few semi-tones below standard for about the same price.  (No matter for me since all I use is the tuner, anyway.)  Still, the SN-13 is *white* and, for all I know, may do a better job at tuning an older iPad.  :-)"
1150,635,4.0,"Cheap, Easy, Durable, these things are worth the small price. I have one for each guitar and just leave them on!"
951,635,4.0,"Well, without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes, usually in the lower octaves, are a little off.  With cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised.  This tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes.  The fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars.  Highly recommended.  And it looks great too."
413,635,3.0,"I'll be honest here - I bought this one primarily because of its looks.  Not a lot of white clip-on tuners around. I also own an SN-8 and in comparing the two, the SN-13 seems to be as tight, but it's only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the SN-8 (which has more features) for a few dollars less than what you're paying for the SN-13.  Still, it's a typical Snark.  It registers very quickly, it's easy to read, and you don't have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration. The stem on mine is a little looser than I would prefer but it still stays in position.My only real gripe isn't unique to this model but to all Snarks.  The curved stem combined with the round head means it won't sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren't exactly robust, so I'm always concerned that one day I'm going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces.  Other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner."
555,635,4.0,"I have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others. Easy and quick. No reason to be out of tune with these tuners. The white is great but no matter what color they are, they are a quality product. Rock on...."
493,635,4.0,"There are lots of ways to tune a guitar ranging from using a tuning fork to sitting next to a properly tuned piano. I've also used a variety of electronic tuners over the years with everything from rows of flashing lights to meters with a needle. There are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators, metronomes, etc. built in. But this device is simple, portable, easy to use, and just plain works. It's also cheap enough that even if you have other types of tuners, it's worth the money to get one of these for each guitar case. Aside from its simplicity, it's also less bothered by background noise, as other units with microphones might be."
752,635,4.0,I set this to free super saver shipping 5-8 days and it got here in three! Its very shiny looking and easy to see because there is a little thing where you can move to point the screen of it. Although my friend told me there is a way you can see the chords you are playing don't know how though. But all I bought it for was the purpose of tuning Mission accomplished. 5 stars for you!
1097,784,4.0,"It does take a little getting used to the programming aspect, but this little pedal is amazing.  I must have 20 different pedals, and I'm always torn which ones ones to bring to practice. With this pedal, it's easy...just grab and go.  Are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals?  Probably not.  But they do the job just fine.  The thing I love the most, and this may be a little anal, but I've actually preset individual settings for each song I play with my band.  That way I can shuffle through the presets with one stomp. Some have two pedal effects, some have 6! If this broke or wore out for whatever reason, I would go right out and buy another one for sure.  Best $100 I've spent on gear."
1356,784,4.0,"This is an extremely versatile pedal.  I was considering getting a reverb or delay pedal, but I decided to go with this instead since it's infinitely more flexible.There are tons of effects.  Some I might not use, but there are plenty I will use.  New firmware was just released, and it adds a few extra effects.  You download the firmware and install via the USB port.I use it with a VHT special 6.  I have a Fulltone OCD after the Zoom.  It works nicely with the tube amp whether or not I turn the OCD on.  The effects sound excellent to me.  I'm now a Zoom fan.If you're lusting after a bunch of effects pedals, but only have the cash for one, this is a really good option.  At a minimum, you'll hopefully figure out the 5-10 you won't really use without having to shell out the cash for them."
707,784,4.0,"Im an true analog guy. But when I grabbed this pedal I was blown away. This little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size. A lot of which do not sound to digital. I was amazed at the tones I could pull out of it. For $99- it is a steal. I would pay twice that for what this pedal does. Easy to navigate and understand. Small enough to fit on any pedalboard. Easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches. If you're looking for a multi effects stomp box, look no farther than the Zoom MS-50G. Well worth the $99.00. Can easily set it up for live situations. Of course you're not gonna get all the effects at a drop of a dime. But I set mine up for a few effects I use live. Works flawless. When in the studio, this is where the pedal shines. Also it can't be beat for when you're just jamming alone at home. If you're are gigging, of course this isn't going to be your go to pedal, but it does come in handy for some really nice effects. The review before mine, well they should of known this pedal isn't the greatest for live venues. That's why we have pedalboards with all our different effects we can call up with the drop of a foot. I was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so. Went to a local music store, heard and was sold. No one can touch Amazon's price and service. Get off the fence and buy this pedal. I promise you won't be sorry \m/CONS: No power supply or USB cable. Besides that, the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic!"
1007,495,3.0,"Honest for cost it's 5 star, but I got 2, and 1 handle was slightly mismolded, rubber groove is a little off... But in no way matters.  Just kinda ok really now I can tell them apart by feel.This is a nice heavy Cordura (like military spec heavy) with self repairing zippers (standard kind) and totally adequate pad, soft nylon lined, and bonus pockets... 3.  Nice build, PVC piping on pocket edges, adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight.  Heavy rubber feet for standing it up, give a 1/2"" of  wet ground protection if needed.For the price of 1 many other brands, I got 2,And for what most folks expect they are great."
1201,495,4.0,"Just got three of these in today and compared one to a used Fender standard (one strap) bag I also got in at the same time.The Chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the Fender does not go thisextra step. The Chromacast also has many more pockets.The specs on the Fender and Chromacast do not back up reality, as the Fender advertizes 12mm padding, and the Chromacast advertizes 10mm padding. Someone is not telling the truth here, and I think it is Fender.This is a good medium class gig bag, that falls somewhere in between a dust bag (like the Burswood) and a Deluxe 20-22mm padded bag.The only thing the bag is missing, is a hanger on the back which the Fender does have.Chromacast should get rid of the plastic (expensive) hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone else.This bag is good for in house, and light use (no throwing it around) transport.If you are gigging, use a deluxe bag, or a hard case.At $20.00, this bag is a steal!"
548,495,4.0,I recently won an Epiphone les paul specail and was in the market for a bag. This fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection. While I wouldn't say to drop it off the roof or run over it with your car... It does seem to do a nice job of protecting it from bumps on the road and such.
170,410,4.0,i own two of these...the first did not have a compartment door..so things just roll around inside case..not happy...but this one is just fine.looks great...no i would not take it on tour...but as far as run around and taking lessons..its safe all latches match up well...enjoy will order again
770,410,0.0,Manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar. I have an ESP Eclipse. Not even close. ChromaCast products are great. They need to fix the info on their web page. I'm not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases. Too bad.
326,410,4.0,"The quality of it is above my expectations. The only thing I would've like different is the accessory box inside. They could've make it a little bigger. The box already fell down 4 times (I got small kids...) and nothing happened to it or the guitar. Great product, worth every penny."
972,410,4.0,it is more than I hoped for! Very nice protection for my Luna! it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat!
651,410,4.0,Once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery.have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon. All latch well and look good. Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the way.have five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them. All fit and work as expected
748,410,3.0,"this case is perfect for storing a guitar in, I would not recommend using it for traveling anywhere unless in the back of your own vehicle, it will protect your guitar but it is not a heavy duty case, for the price this would be hard to beat by anyone"
134,410,4.0,"I don't travel often with my guitars, but needed good protection for those times when I do. This product meets all my expectations. My Les Paul and Fat Strat, both fit well in the case. It provides good support and cushioning, with a roomy accessories compartment. The corners of the case are well reinforced. The hardware is mid-grade. I believe it will hold up well for my use, and for someone playing weekend gigs. Overall it is a bargain for the price."
420,68,4.0,"This electric guitar padded bag is exactly what I wanted.  The price was right, the guitar is secure and wont' get scratched.  The pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig.  Very cost-effective.  Great price."
696,68,4.0,"I couldn't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon. This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it, (in fact this review will be the first), so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback, but I'm glad I decided on this item.I wanted something with several storage compartments, so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly. This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments, each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items. Perfect! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled, as well as a guitar strap that I don't currently require as I already have one, but it's nice to have a spare now.The padding of the bag is quite thin, but firm, so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying. The two built in ""back-pack"" straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage, and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to.If you are in the market for a guitar bag and don't want to spend a fortune, I would definitely recommend you consider this item. It is perfect for my requirements, and may well be for yours too."
1244,68,2.0,"This does the job but it's fairly thin and not all that well padded.  For twice the price, you can get a really nice Yamaha hard case that is way more than twice as good.  The strap that came with it is no great shakes either."
223,68,4.0,"Great gig bag for acoustic guitar. Very well made with good padding. It has six nice pockets, a rubber bumper, and two straps. It fits the guitar nicely. I would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag. The strap and picks were an added bonus. A great value."
891,68,0.0,"Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it. Not durable! Spend a few more dollars, it is worth it."
865,68,0.0,"A great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time I tried zipping it up. I have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight."
835,63,4.0,I have had and tried about every compressor out there.  Lastly the old standard Dyna Comp. Only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone.  Blah.  This is a very transparent compressor.  I use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric.  Low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11:00.  It gives wonderful string balance and sustain. At this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds. And it does not wack the bottom out of your tone.  None of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string.  Just balance and sustain.  As close to a rack mount as it gets. The blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues.  From here you can get any type of compression you want or need.  Mine has a white case.
7,63,4.0,"It arrived, I plugged it in, already had a battery in it. Both knobs at 12 o'clock, toggle in middle, didn't change the internal switches. BAM!! Guitar sounds alive! No more weak notes, the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power. No compressor ""pumping"" very minimal noise (compressors by nature are noisy) It just make the guitar sound better, even and stronger. Compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound. This pedal has been optimized for guitar, you can tell it is high quality. If you play crystal clear you HAVE to have this pedal. Driven, full distortion it adds sustain. Im Sold. Now I may just have to get the SL drive also by xotic. look it up on youtube."
775,63,4.0,I had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed!  This compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack.  It never sounds &#34;thumpy&#34; or unnatural - but always musical.  I really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like.
386,63,4.0,"Okay, so... it's small, easy to dial in a good sound, very inexpensive, made here in the US, and has a wonderful transparency to it.Add to that the different ways to configure it (by using the internal dip switches), and you have a compressor as flexible as any I've used for guitar at half or less of many cost (which sound, imho, no better).It stacks well with the EP booster and another comp/boost in the chain, too.Whether you want to drive your amp a little harder or just squash your signal, this product is impossible to beat.I totally adore it."
54,96,4.0,"It's sturdy, and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position. I'm using it with a Samson Meteor USB mic (which required some adaptation due to the Meteor's short body), which is a heavy cast-metal mic. No stability problems whatsoever."
959,96,4.0,This boom has cleaned up my desk quite a bit and is great value for the price/performance ratio. I have an AT 4033 in it and it holds it in place with no problems. Wish I would have known about it sooner.
902,96,2.0,"I had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk, and since it was off to the side, made it tuff to watch the level meters. This clamp-on boom serves the purpose, but has a hard time holding the weight of my Shure KSM 32 condenser mic. I tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it, to keep it from sagging. Very affordable, and I found a work around for the weight issue. I wouldn't recommend this if you're doing a lot of recording, but it is sufficient for my home studio."
966,96,3.0,"This arm hold the weight of a ATR2100 microphone fine. It stays where you put it and it works as you would expect. The packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works. The shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts. I did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me. However it works great. Not too big and gets the job done.Tip, just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit. My ATR2100 is a 2 inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around 3 inches. I just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great."
655,96,0.0,straight out of the box this product reeked cheap. No directions inside or on the box. I messed with it for about 5 minutes. I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic. I read the description but it did not say cheap. Live and learn.
1012,96,2.0,"There's no way to attach the shock mount to it (screws for securing it aren't provided, the holes dont match up, etc...Oh well, I went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead.I'll come up with a use for this arm later otherwise I'd have returned it.Will NOT hold a Blue Yeti / Yeti Pro microphone. Just an FYI"
195,658,4.0,"These are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum. Designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job. You do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind. Being 10's they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is. I love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that. They are made in the USA which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there, put America to work. Get to picking."
378,658,4.0,"I already use the EXL111 as my go-to electric string and tried these as part of the Vine program.  I have to say I really couldn't feel the difference.  From what I can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the D string gauge is .25, whereas the same string in the EXL111 set is .24.  Since the string construction and plating is the same, I have to assume these will have the same longevity. I guess as long as both are still available (EXL111 being phased out?) i will be selecting solely on price.  Either way you can't go wrong as D'Addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price."
849,658,4.0,"At first, I wasn't sure what to expect from these D'Addario ""Balanced Tension"" strings. D'Addario makes some pretty strong claims for these strings, including ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings for evenly balanced bending, strumming, fretting, picking, plucking and slapping"".I can't really speak to those claims; all I can tell you is these are darn good strings, sound great, feel great. I recommend them highly."
73,658,4.0,"The D'Addario Balanced Tension strings are a good value, and worth slightly higher price. These are excellent strings, the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar. They are inexpensive and sound great. For somebody that is a casual home musician, coated strings might be a better choice. The difference, somebody that plays a two or three hours every day, will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in. Somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem.The big question for me, is the Balanced Tension worth a little extra money? It seems like yes they are. The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better. There isn't a huge difference. The direct comparison string is D'Addario EXL110, (D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Regular Light, 10-46), at roughly $3.50 a set, these are good solid strings at a bargain price. The EXL110BT strings are about $5.00 a set. If I were going through a set of strings every few days, the EXL110's would probably be a better idea. But if a set is going to last a week or two, the savings overall is pretty small, I would use the EXL110BT's.My personal preference is coated strings, I like Elixir strings a lot. The new D'Addario coated strings are fine, but they end up being about the same price as Elixir. I'll stick with what I know well.My 1981 Lucille did love these strings. They worked out just fine.On the packaging, I don't like what D'Addario has done. All the strings are in a single plastic package, I prefer individual paper envelopes. They loop two strings together and I hate that. When I'm stringing my guitar I like to work with one string at a time, and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench. Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while. They are trying to save packaging, and that is a good thing. But seriously, that little paper wouldn't kill anybody. I also don't care for the color coded rings on the strings. Lucille has an open bridge where I can see those electric colors. It is a small thing, but I don't like it. I prefer that the rings all be brass, one color. Yeah, I'm the only one that sees that problem. If I work one string at a time from an individual envelope, the color coding is not necessary.These are fine strings. They are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend."
1041,658,4.0,"I am impressed with d'addario's electric strings. Easy to adjust to, very light on my fingers and they're built to last. With a few adjustments to my amp settings, these strings are very dynamic in their tone quality from classic to hard rock styles. Any guitarist who plays electric can enjoy these strings, and they last a long time too."
804,658,4.0,"I've used D'Addario strings for a long time (been playing 20+yrs) and have always been satisfied with their tone. The balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension. Do I fully understand how this works... nope, but they sure do sound good. Their feel is a little more ""snappy"" than regular XL's in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well. Their sound is bright, just like their XL cousins. I think it's more of a ""feel"" thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings. Now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instruments...All in all a great product that I recommend to any electric guitarist."
1123,658,4.0,"I still had the original strings on an Epiphone LP-100 guitar I bought last November. I know that's bad, but buying strings can be complicated (and overwhelming). It was nice to get these through Vine and try them out.There is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on. It sounds cleaner and brighter.I wish I'd changed the strings when I first started learning to play because these are much easier to play. Now it's not much of an issue, but it would have made a difference when I was breaking in my fingers those many months ago.I would definitely buy these again, especially because they are so inexpensive."
1067,658,3.0,"I've been playing D'Addario XLs in their standard  .010, .011 and .013 gauge sets for many years now, so I was curious to see how these new ""balanced"" sets would feel. I expected a more even feel across the fingerboard, but experienced something quite different- right off, the B string felt a lot stiffer.  Looking at the tension table D'Addario publishes it's clear why this is the case. In the traditional .01s, the B string has about 30% lower tension that the E and G. In these new sets, the B is at the same tension, which is to say it's under 40% more tension than the B in the traditional set. That's a significant increase.  If you're used to the lower tension, the ""balanced"" tension feels a lot stiffer at first.The higher tension string requires a different amount of compensation at the bridge, too, which means changing the setup- not easily done on a Telecaster, where changing the length of the B changes the length of the E as well. Being higher in tension, the new B should require more compensation, since it'll shift pitch even more when you depress/stretch it. Since my Tele is currently set up as close as I could get the E and B to perfect comnpensation, I didn't feel like playing with it.After playing a while, the set started to feel more natural to me. I don't think I'll be changing gauges on the Tele right away, as I have about a dozen .010s in stock as well as over a dozen .013s fro my archtop. But I may experiment a bit with the new gauges for my Epiphone Dot Custom, which I string with .011s. I'm wondering if the balanced sets will give me a more even string-to-string feel, and if so, it would be worth my effort to change over."
990,658,4.0,"I'm always looking for the perfect electric guitar strings, as is evidenced by my drawer full of spare string sets that I felt failed me for one reason or another. A set of these came my way & as I had just gotten a 1966 Fender Jaguar I did what I always do when I get a new guitar - I restring it even though the strings were practically new. I could immediatly tell the difference in both feel & sound. The sound was crisper than the super slinkys that were on it & they felt good to my fingers. The only reason I took them off was because the Jag was for surf music & I wanted heavier gauge so I put these on my Tele, which was a match made in heaven. They sounded great but most telling is that after a month or so of heavy usage they still sound great. Reasonable price, great sound & long lasting. To me thats a perfect combo. Highly recommended!!!"
831,658,3.0,"I put these on a Parker.  Great that they have uniform tension.  Took a bit to get used to, but they are very playable.  vlues, rock, country.  Nice strings."
22,658,3.0,"Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's.D'Addario promises these strings to be ""comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations"" that result in ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings.""I dunno anything regarding the science behind this, but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of D'Addario 10s they offer.  Its not a huge huge difference, but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance.For one thing, they're pretty stiff.  They bend, but not easily.  Maybe that's what they mean by ""Balanced tension.""  They're also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s.  Not flatwound mellow, by any means, but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s.  I do get a great rock tone out of them, mind you, but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound.  Personally, I like the tone I get out of them, they're big and warm without being dull sounding, but again, your preferences might differ.One thing that's GREAT about these strings is, once they're properly stretched, they stay in tune FOREVER!  Again, maybe this is part of the ""balanced tension,"" and if so, good job D'Addario.I haven't had them on forever to really see how long they last, but they've been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one.Who would these appeal to?  Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these.  If you're a rythm player who does long gigs, the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you!"
253,658,4.0,"I have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years. I just keep coming back to these. The sound isn't quite as bright as the phosphorus bronze, but it is more of a acoustic guitar sound, anyway. These are clear, high quality and come sealed in tight plastic so the strings aren't exposed to air until you open them. Because of that little ""difference"" they do stay clean much longer than the brands simply wrapped in paper. I just can't think of a single complaint."
916,512,4.0,"This is the most awesome loop pedal ever!!! does the trick perfect, you can remove and add in elements to your loop! super small, only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered."
942,512,4.0,"This looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price.  To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red, continue playing.  When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back.  At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish.  No need to line it up with the loop, it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop.  If you don't like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub. Want to stop and clear (two presses and press and hold) and your back to a clean slate.  I don't know the limit of overdubs but I haven't reached it.  The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content.  The tone preservation is excellent and haven't noticed any issues there.  You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record, then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it.  If I have something I like, I then output it to Sonar to play with some more.Pros- Small, very easy to use (1 level knob and a stomp button), designed by guitarists and it shows, true bypass and plenty of room for recording.Cons- You may consider lack of battery a con, I don't, everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC.  No drum track or click track but then again, the aim for this device was to keep is simple, I believe.UPDATE: I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself.  I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken, replace at the store which I did.  It worked great then one night again, I couldn't hear myself recording.  I played for about an hour with different configurations, it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal.  Out of the 4 I have it only liked 2.  When I used that adapter it seemed to work just fine.  So beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the 9V AC Adapter."
1081,512,4.0,"Small footprint, simple to use, one button, one knob and does not suck tone out of my guitar. It's only got a basic feature set but that's all I need. Reasonable price too. Highly recommended."
1276,512,4.0,I can become VERY creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settings.I have other musicians online who jam with me and I can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where I am going with a song.So many things I have developed.Great tool and good quality product.
631,512,4.0,"WOW! If you want 5 minutes of no-nonsense, clean looping and overdubbing,...the tc electronics DITTO pedal will not disappoint! I have been exploring the fringes and outer limits of guitar FX for over 30 years and this one has, in just two days, become one of my Top Five 'Gotta Have' effects. It is so simple that a five year old could make great loops, and it add ZERO addition sound to your signal. Placed at the end of your pedalboard, which is easy to do because of the DITTO's tiny footprint, the possibilities for live stunts and grooves is mind-blowing. And you can't beat the price. I've uploaded a 5m workout that I recorded on my 2nd day using the DITTO if you'd like to hear it - a solo improvisation for Telecaster and reverb. [...]"
842,512,4.0,"Wow, for the size, this is amazing.  Plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper.  Nothing else to say it's great, if you're in the market for one, get it."
524,512,4.0,For performing I'd go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price. Would definitely purchase it again.
722,512,4.0,"TC just does things right.  I love how easy this is to use, the incredible clarity of sound, and 5 minutes of recording time.  I do a single, duo, and full band.  It goes with me to all gigs and I do use it for when I am practicing.  Highly recommended solution."

975,512,4.0,Definitely the best looper I've come across. Lots of looping time; simple to use; unlimited overdubs.Really can't go wrong with the Ditto!
281,512,3.0,"Perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone's pedal board.  Many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right.  Having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting.  The ditto is great for practice, though."
1268,512,4.0,"I've owned Loop Stations, DM-4s, Jam Mans, Samplers and all that jazz. They're all full of crap you dont need. This pedal has flawless, colorless sound quality. It records what you sound like. You click it on, record your riff, click it and listen to it loop. Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over. You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers. Smallest, Cheapest, easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find. If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use, then dont get this one, but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this."
1312,512,0.0,"Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply. I didn't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase, nor in the package. This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics."
602,512,4.0,"I always wanted a Boomerang III looper, which at almost $500 was not really a justifiable expense for me.  Then, I found this for about $100, and I immediately sprung for it.  This is a great practice tool.  All it does is make loops.  The learning curve is very low, and there's no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total 5-minute recording time.  There are no quirky timing issues to be found here; your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops.  This does take some getting used to, but it makes you a much better musician in the process; your drummer and bassist will thank you.This could possibly even be used as a live performance tool, although you'd have to be very, very proficient with this tool and be playing very, very tightly in the pocket.  I personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this, lest something go wrong on stage (and lest I subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick).Students would be especially encouraged to get one of these.  My playing has definitely grown and improved since I finally broke down and bought a looper."
974,512,4.0,This is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes....so that is awesome! The playback sound is very good quality.
374,512,4.0,"I had previously owned it Digitech jam man, I also try the boss.After seeing demos of this item on YouTube I decided  I'll give it a try, I can always return it if I didn't like it.The unit is extremely small but don't let that fool you. This unit is a high-quality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly. You get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs. Let's be serious how many people really Loop for over five minutes?The unit is transparent when turned off I would highly recommend this Looper it's well worth the money."
459,512,4.0,"I'm a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever.am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43. That being said using the looper was an eye opener. I bought it as a learning aide , to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression. The thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression I played. There's no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing. Let's just say I'm not as close to being a player as I thought and I would &#34;not&#34; figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper. So it is an amazing critic for us beginners . And if your like me ( and you experienced guitarist ) you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for. It's an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment , after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins you'll have the gist of it. From what I understand it's very basic compared to other loopers , i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction."
444,512,3.0,"This little simple looper sure is a ton of fun. Beware that there is a learning curve to looping. With trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while. I'm a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback, could be better. I use this mainly with a double neck bass/guitar. Compliments well."
239,620,4.0,"Tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years. Their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception. Excellent sound quality, premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station. You can't go wrong with these, we're ordering 8 more pairs!"
1232,620,4.0,"I've tried these out in head-to-head (excuse the pun) runs versus Steelseries, Plantronics, Panasonic, and Sony headphones that all cost more... and the Tascam TH02 keeps up!I'm really surprised at how well they perform.  Lows are good, mids are clean, and highs are crisp.  Yes, the lows could be a bit beefier, but out of the headphones I compared it to, only the Plantronics excelled in that area.For fit: I have a large noggin; like, size 7 5/8 hat.  And these headphones fit well!  Not too tight, snug, but not confining. The padding is good and soft.Seriously, I'd rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break (which they haven't, and I've taken them everywhere) than spend $100 on another set."
305,620,4.0,These headphones get the job done. I like the build and design. Very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs.
1214,620,4.0,"These headphones are 100% amazing. I could not believe the sound quality. I have been an audio engineer for over 30 years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth $200-$300...nice wide spectrum and frequency response, you will love them, well worth the price. (no I do not work for Tascam)... the first pair I bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily....so I ordered another pair, because the sound is amazing, I just need to be more careful next time!!...but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction...I have yanked my Senhieser's millions of times and the cord never broke, so be careful with the cord on this headphone...it is not the best, but the sound is superior."
90,620,2.0,"I only just received these, but thought I'd give my first impression. I purchased headphones because I figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in-ear type. I chose this model because they were on sale, seemed to be a diamond in the rough, and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads(I wear an XL hat size).The build is average. They don't feel flimsy in my hands, but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special, strength-wise. The padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam, as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head, it sort of looks warped. The 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone. The headphones can both swivel 90 degrees forward, maybe 35 degrees back, and 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband.I listened to about 45 minutes of music straight to start, and was pretty pleased. I'm not especially particular, but do like good sound. There's some good bass, classical music was clear. The headphones did make me realize I had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that I tried out(listening to the HD equivalent on YouTube cleared up problems I heard). I wasn't totally blown away, either. I do hear a little noise when they're plugged into my computer and nothing is playing, though not so for my iPod(so I'm not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones).They are comfortable, but not as comfortable as I'd like. I do feel some pushing against my ears, the round ear pads aren't big enough to fit my whole ear. They do get warmer than I'd like. I definitely feel relieved to have them off. I think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour. I was a little hesitant to get over-ear headphones in fear of this, and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem.Who knows, maybe they'll wear in and improve. I'll update this review if I have more to report. For now, I'd say they're worth the cost, even if they aren't a shining diamond in the rough. If I could give about 3.5 stars I would; but for now, I'll give 3. They are accurately priced, and overall a typical quality product. Some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons.Update 7/19:I've been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days, it's helped a bit. What's funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge! It's comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches...but the pushing against your head is the tight part. If you adjust them larger, they just fall below your ears, rather than loosen up.Also, I compared them to the Sennheiser HD201. The TASCAMs have better sound, but the Sennheiser is more comfortable(they're lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better).Update 7/23:I think the box stretching has been helping, I'm able to wear them for about 2 hours now before I notice them getting uncomfortable. Still a relatively short amount of time.Update 8/9/2013:The headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren't in use. The comfort is marginally improving, I'm guessing due to the stretching out, my head/ears getting used to the pressure, and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure. However, I think my rating will remain at 3 stars. The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars, and the price low enough for one more. However, a month should be long enough for the phones to break-in to a standard usable degree, and that hasn't happened to my satisfaction.CONCLUSION: I would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head(mine is about 24""/61cm circumference, or US hat size 7 and 5/8). The clamping definitely leads to discomfort, the round ear pads don't quite do the trick, and it makes your head pretty warm. It's not unbearable, but if you can find an alternative it's probably best. That being said, note that I have only reduced stars for the fit!! I can't speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head(and ears?)...if these fit comfortably, which I imagine they would for many people, they are a 5 star product! Great sounding, sturdy enough build, etc.Update 11/14/13:A friend of mine picked up a pair of Audio-Technica M50s around the same time I bought this pair, and I was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today. I'm not very experienced with sound quality, but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears. The bass seemed more supported, higher notes felt smoother and less static-like, etc. Besides the volume, these differences weren't huge. I had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them. The point of this update is just to say that you aren't getting $150 headphones for $30 with the TASCAMs. You are getting very good headphones, the sound of which should more than satisfy most people. I think you're pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones(in this case, you'd pay 5X more for the M50s...but I don't think you're getting 5X the sound quality). The M50s are significantly more comfortable(though they do make your ears warmer), and the build feels better(stronger, smoother adjustments, prettier, etc.). All these things combined, and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable."
798,620,1.0,"Soooo bummed. I simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. The max time I can wear them is like an hour, and then I can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. Also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. So it's kind of like double trouble. However, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). If it weren't for the discomfort factor, I would be using them all the time. As of now, I hardly use them at all. In fact, when I first tested these out, I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. But I'm glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test. Of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. If so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. If not, ouch. Cheers!"
170,834,3.0,although im not onstage bouncing aroung...they hold the strap on just fine...no changing hardware like strap locks...yes..more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice...but i will order more..
1301,834,3.0,"so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locks.I tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe, but alas, I was too slow.It's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle cap.So the Fender ones will do just fine, plus they come in 2 colors and say Fender.Time to open another Carlsberg, cheers Fender."
1100,834,4.0,"My Epiphone SST Classic didn't have the strap pin, so I took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place, as I don't want to do another hole to my guitar, I left it there, but I'm afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground, so I bought these Fender strap blocks, and I use it on my two Epiphone guitars that I can't use the Planet Waves Strap lock with. My other Epiphone guitar is an Epiphone Hummingbird.They work great!! I would buy these again."
1009,834,4.0,This is a good product. These work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on. I like.
8,834,4.0,An amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar. 2 months and no problems yet
796,700,3.0,Its a good amp im happy with it. The high gain is not the best a lot of unwated noise even while playing and i see a few people on here have had the same problem. But i mostly play punk/hardcore and blues which is does very well. So when im in a metal mood i use a BOSS metal zone pedal on a clean BUTCHER seting and no unwated noise even at loud volumes. so its good amp i just wish i didn't need to use pedals to get good metal sound thats why i got this amp so could get rid of my pedals o well
1428,700,3.0,"I have the Fender Mustang IV and I would say the fender is a superior modeling amp, but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get. The bass sounds great and when I played Here Comes the Sun on my acoustic, I'd swear the tone sounded like the Beatles record. The modeling sound is ok  and they tell me there's a looper here but i'd have to pay an  extra $120 for a pedal to access it. Oops, there goes a star for the con job. Peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less. I'll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future."
84,700,4.0,"Great little amp. I replaced a 35 year old Fender chorus with this. No comparison. I have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud. The factory setup is great, but you can set it up anyway you want it."
270,700,4.0,"VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp! As a bass player, I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar. I can't raise the volume above 1 in my house. When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode, the volume decreases dramatically, but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally.Excellent top quality features. Beautiful sound for each of the different modes. The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic. The amp simulation is top notch.Awesome value for the price!Edit: I've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings....I'm even MORE impressed. One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero. I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOM....huge sound. I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group. After experimenting more, I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band.I still can't get over the fact that it is a 40W amp. The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage."
789,595,4.0,I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless. Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo.
804,595,4.0,"The Tascam DP-008EX is great!!! I love this little box! It's got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop. Here are a few of the features that I really like about it...1. It's portable and runs on 4AA batteries.2. It has compression, exciter & de-esser as well as EQ and Reverb.3. It has a mastering section with effects.4. You can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks.5. It feels sturdy (not that I would drop it)....just to name a few.  I compared this against the Fostex MR8mkII, which I also own and like. The Tascam has more features for the buck, as well it should as it just came out this year and the Fostex has been around a while. As another reviewer put it, this won't replace your DAW. I can record some very polished songs on my laptop, but the Tascam does come close. The mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too. I have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. The portability factor is huge in my opinion. Being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs, or vice versa, is great. Plus it's fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas.I totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner... and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section. FIVE STARS!!!"
89,427,3.0,"Everything keeps improving, and getting better, faster, and cheaper, but at this price point their isn't one available that isn't a compromise in one way or another. First off if you are planning on buying the US-322 don't. Buy its bigger brother the US-366. Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money, as well as 192k makes it a no-brainer. To get optical (on the 366 only) at this price is great, but the A/D D/A converters leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good, have distortion ratings, THD of only 0.0045% and with 24 Bit/192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to date.What I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres, and weak clocks, or vice versa, and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa, etc. I researched interfaces for a long, long time, and considering non-crash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 2.0 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in, 30 out. Now that's an interface. I have been running it with Pro Tools 9 since 2011.Pro Tools 10- Professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and Pro Tools 11 is now being released.So if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another. Rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope, I would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US-322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out. Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved. So what I did was load, and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver, and doing updates for both. I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface, and therefore they didn't need to spend much time with it. I don't blame them; the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn't happen in just one hour. So here goes...If you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP, 7, and 8. I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake. I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare non-functional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well. It works in Win 7 just fine. So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64. In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content, Groove Agent One, Vintage Beat Boxes, Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load, as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements. I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc, creating a Steinberg account (which is free and they don't ask you for a credit card). They provide you with an activation code after you register.I have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program. Cubase does not require that you have one, although they have an equivalent looking device, but fortunately they have a software based equivalent. They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6.5.4.1122. There is an eLicense control setup and you have a Soft eLicenser number that you will use in order to generate the Activation Code generated at the Steinberg site. What came on my disc was version 6.05 which they instruct you to immediately do an update, which I did to version 6.07.So we install the Tascam interface next which comes on a separate DVD. Included with the interface is a 5 foot USB printer style cable. You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer. Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver. So install the driver off of the disc first, and then do the update. It took at least 15 minutes to do that update. What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving. At first it says, ""This is going to take a long time"", and they were exactly right. It almost tempts you to think something is wrong, because nothing is happening other than the scrolling, and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says, ""Do you want to install?"" and you click continue, and then it comes up again in another minute, and this happens a few times, and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box. (I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash). Then you reboot.Now this is important. Plug the US-322 directly into an available USB 2.0 port and not into a hub, even if it is a powered hub. It simply won't work. I tried it and the light wouldn't even come on indicating USB. When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked. The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 1.1. The US-322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide. There is also an owner's manual for both the Interface, and Cubase that are available either on the DVD, or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download. If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading. There is a driver to choose, input and output settings, as well as going into Windows Control Panel/Sound in order to choose the interface for playback, and recording. If you're new to these kinds of setups just take your time, and don't be dismayed if something doesn't work. All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound. For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won't get any sound from the headphones. If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US-322 and then click on the support tab, and they have a ""you pay for it"" phone call number in order to help you. Hope this helps.PS: The real killer deal right now is Avid Pro Tools 9 bundle with the MBox Mini which is another limited interface but you are getting Pro Tools 9. Plus purchases of this bundle made after 10/2011 that has pro tools 9 will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools 10 if you register your product with Avid. Considering what Pro Tools goes for by itself, and what the MBox sells for individually, and the bundle even comes with the iLok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it, and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts I have seen pop up as much as 20% off the already low price. Then you have Pro Tools 9, and 10 full blown versions, none of this LE stuff, and an interface, and can grow from there. This Tascam interface works great with Pro Tools. These Pro Tools 9 bundles are discounted to make way for 11, and I am seeing music stores running out of them. They are clearing the shelves preparing for 11, but it has bugs. I rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some, and get feedback from users. After some time, and more updates, I will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to 11; maybe in another year. PT 9 is all I need."
849,427,2.0,"While the Tascam US-322 Audio Interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording, it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included Cubase LE software. I am not a novice at home recording, as I have used many devices from 4 track cassettes to ProTools setups over the years. Here is a rundown of my disappointing experience:1) plugged into my iPad using the camera kit USB connector - got ""device not compatible with iPad"" message. Too bad, but I can still use my ART USB interface which works quite well with Garageband.2) installed driver on my old, G4 Mac running 10.5.8; opened Garageband, got  ""no input"" message.Could not evaluate the Cubase software, as it requires Mac OS 10.6.8. If I get a new computer, I will update my review. Until then, I'm disappointed."
1409,427,1.0,"I love Tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. Also, the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions. (Sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD?)There was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. I could not. I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input. Now this could have been my computer or Audacity, as it is an older Win XP machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to Tascam's web site. I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. If I am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from ""user community"" threads in some blog.Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software which I can't get on Linux. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints.Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. The controls on  this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yeah, I know, touch screens are COOL.)Also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.I am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. I value function over fashion, however, and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear: it was supremely functional. This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. Not so here.I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if I could) for me. Come on, Tascam, you can do better than this."
826,427,4.0,Awesome audio interface.  Perfect for my beginner studio setup. All set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe. Easy set up
1198,427,2.0,"This unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording.  It is powered via the USB bus, so you don't have to carry power supplies, or worry about finding an outlet for the device.One issue is that this is not a plug-and-play device.  You will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it.  After the driver was installed, I was able to get Pro Tools to recognize it right away without any issue.  I recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded.  It works like any other interface in Pro Tools, so you will be able to use it easily enough.  The mic pre-amps don't seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones I use to record vocals and guitars.  I found that the overall sound quality was okay, but just okay. I wouldn't want to use this for anything important, but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals, or doing pre-production in a practice space.  I wouldn't recommend it for serious studio work though and I would rather drag my Pro Tools I/O rack to a location if I was in the field.The build quality is a bit suspect on this as well.  I noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when I picked it up after taking it out of the box.  It seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose.  I can move the top and bottom together and apart, making a clinking sound.  This can, of course, be taken care of very easily, but I would rather have a device come as it should.  I have never had a problem with a TASCAM unit before and I have had a ton over the years, so I hope this is just a one-off quality control issue.  The knobs feel okay, but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky.Bottom line: 3/5 starsRecommended for casual use, but not for commercial use"
559,427,4.0,Works perfectly.  Got the drivers for Mac from the website and it instantly showed up in core-audio. Very easy to use. Love it!
110,711,4.0,Purchased this and a comparable Hosa cable. This cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved. Hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling. I will stick to GLS products from this point forward.
88,711,4.0,"I ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised.  They are excellent quality, clear tone and a great look.  I was actually impressed with the room that the cables gave my tone and the clarity they have.  For Price and Quality these are top notch."
854,711,4.0,"Definitely the best combination of price, durability and sound quality that I've come across. Plus, the tweed look really grows on you.  Ordered a bunch for the studio, and a bunch more for home. Holds up well, even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on. Do it!"
1136,711,4.0,"First of all, 20 ft is not too long. Better to have a little bit of extra length than too short. The cable works fine and is very flexible. Also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones. Recommended!"
710,711,4.0,"Constructed well, works perfectly, rolls up nicely with no kinks. The  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by GLS Audio."
999,142,2.0,"These are durable, but I get some noise from the cables. It's barely audible, but it's distracting nonetheless."
1127,142,2.0,The cable tangles easily. Not stiff enough.It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out. But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types. It also seem tightly put together at the ends.
1213,142,3.0,A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord. LOL The cord delivers good sound quality. The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy.
875,142,4.0,This is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try I recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable.
270,142,3.0,Very nice quality. I've removed 1 star because of the 1/4 casing. The sheath likes to twist off a little too easily. I used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up. Other than that. I've been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great.
779,366,4.0,This bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount. I am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an Ernie Ball strap. The raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest.
481,366,4.0,Works great.  Easy to use
1024,366,4.0,"My acoustic only has the end pin strap button and none at the heel of the neck. I was using a bit of string to tie the strap to the headstock, but it was ugly. This, however, is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot. Highly recommend."
143,366,3.0,"... but... they're the cheesiest looking leather I've ever seen... real leather for sure, but somehow the maker found real leather that looks like cheap vinyl imitation leather."
109,366,4.0,"Yep. it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar. I have a Washburn rover, a backpacker style, and so a stap is a necessity, and this works just great."
1103,366,4.0,"I am happy with the strap button that I purchased, however they sent me the wrong one.  No big deal."
787,366,4.0,"If you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar, I would suggest this. I have a vintage 60s Dixon Hummingbird. I was really worried about scuffing it up. Don't worry with this."
47,628,4.0,"For some reason, when I saw &#34;48 picks&#34; I think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks... What I got was a slim resealable bag that's about 1/8th the size I was thinking of.  It comes with Light, Medium and Heavy picks.  Even the Light picks are thicker than the &#34;thin&#34; picks I had ordered before.  I like having the variety though.  This has a variety of colors as well as the thickness.The only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so I could maybe hang it from my strap."
1029,628,4.0,just love them came really quick love all the different colors and thicknesses in all the colors you can fined a fine med or heavy
140,628,4.0,I love this assortment.  Every color and size you'll ever need.  You can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while.  This was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality.  I would buy this again or recommend to anyone.  I use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though.  Definitely a 5 star purchase.
393,628,4.0,"Love my assortment of picks and the price was right. I like that their is different gauges, because I don't always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but I only received 47 instead of 48 picks but whose counting, i'm  still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again, thanks."
561,628,4.0,they are just great what more can I say They product is high quality and a good price I am enjoying them
898,826,3.0,"I have about quit using picks now.  But I needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses.  That's what you get with this.  From very thin and flexible to 0.8 and hard, you get a selection."
206,826,4.0,Perfect to try different sizes and shapes!! great quality. Buy it if you don't know which size or shape will work best for you.
234,826,4.0,"Terrific way to tray out various picks without committing to a whole pack of something you might not end up liking.  And high praise for GO-DPS Music.  These guys had the product out the door the same day I ordered it, sent some great sale information on other gear, and included a catalog explaining the specs of all the picks I'd ordered.  I only spent 1.99 and I really felt like they went out of their way to earn more of my business - which they did!"
1174,826,3.0,"Couldn't be happier than playing with a variety of picks - each one has a different feel and sound. The dura picks have more variety, there's only one in each thickness. The celluloid ones come two per size. As a pick, I liked using all of them, from the super floppy thinnest dura to the hard plastic thickest celluloid. Worth getting even if just to experiment - some of the picks were easier to use for certain songs than others, and the different thicknesses definitely have a different sound. Similar thickness picks of both material sounded the same but felt different to the fingers."
552,826,4.0,A fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from.A great deal for a nominal amount of money.
465,826,4.0,"just what you see. A good variety of different picks. I got it for me and my dad. My dad plays guitar, and he likes the thinner onnes"
795,826,4.0,"After taking my guitar lessons...I never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars. My instructor told me that I need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand, and to see if I could pick out some melody's without too much problem. I realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work, and I have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes, flexibilities, and strengths. Just go for the gusto and find what you like!"
222,826,3.0,"If you are picky these are all eye candy... nice flexible, easy to hold and I received on time at a great price."
515,572,3.0,"Throw this right in my little storage bag I use for my gigging materials...microphones, cables, straps, tuner, etc. folds up easy, fits great. Seems stable enough."
260,572,4.0,"My classical guitar stand was metal and short, like this, but did not have the front brace or download slant. If I had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it's headstock on the hard flood. So sad. I mourn it still."
1313,572,3.0,"Solid, and super easy to use. The best for the price I supposeGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand"
101,572,4.0,"You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand.  It folds up so small, and yet remains very stable in use.  Adjustable in a snap, but if you even forget that, it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand.  Anything can be knocked over, but this really works better than you might believe.  Goood !"
101,234,4.0,"I've been able to purchase 5 of these in different sizes for all my pickin' pals.  Lightweight, easy to transport in the back of your amp, or just put it in a bag with your music.  THESE are good values for the money, and do not fall over easily.  Those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work.  I mean really work well too.  Not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas, but otherwise.  They are the BOMB !  whee"
50,234,4.0,This is a great portable uke stand to have with you.  It folds up small and will fit in the outside pocket on your uke gig bag.  Having this stand is a lot better than just laying your uke on the floor.
497,234,4.0,"This stand is small, compact, and sturdy.  It holds my tenor uke just fine, and when folded, fits into the pocket of my uke case.  It's perfect to take along to a gig or practice, and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down."
163,234,4.0,"This stand holds up my ukulele, so yay. Folded up, it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the Hola gig bag, which I also use and heartily recommend. Make no mistake - this stand is not pretty, it feels and looks like cheap plastic, but it does the job."
589,648,4.0,"I bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar. There is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state (this is a solid state). People will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a $400 tube amp to practice through. (&#34;You're not getting the right tone, man....&#34; The problem with that is, there are several companies out there Marshall, Fender, Vox, Orange, etc....and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one. So, I figured, before I committed to a company, maybe I could just use this Fender to emulate some of those sounds I want.That worked out beautifully. Though I am very much a beginner, I have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp's eq can have on your guitar's tone. I thought I needed pedals to have some of these effects, instead I can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger/reverb/modulation I need. I have got to the point where I understand about how just adjusting my volume/switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when I want to.I would not have been able to do that without this amp. This amp helped me develop as a beginner so I wouldn't waste money buying other things, beginners think they should get. Excellent amp and I recommend getting this over the Mustang II. Save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more."
140,648,4.0,"My first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it.  I couldn't get it to sound like I wanted it to.....I WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARS...I must now rerate it with a 5 star.  This amp does almost too much for the money.  My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has.  It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it too.WOW, I never knew my guitar could sound like this.  It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have.  I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out, if I ever do.  The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings.So, in short, forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early.  BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it.  If you are looking for a small, plug and play amp...this isn't it.  But it you're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities. this IS it.  It is growing on me and I wouldn't part with it now."
52,648,3.0,"Luv it, I had version #1 and this amp isnt much different.they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software"
1136,648,4.0,"Do not expect this to sound like a Fender Frontman with 2 x 12"" speakers. But for practicing in your bedroom or similar it's perfect. Plenty of sound effects to mess around with. Are they as good as dedicated $100 per stomp box effects? Probably not, but so what. Just found out the best part of this amp. You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software, but it lets you pipe your guitar's sounds into software like Garage Band. You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an M-Audio M-Track or similar. PS: It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer (even with the right adapter plugs) as the impedances will not be right. On top of that, I have connected the Mac's headphone audio out to the amp's AUX in! Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PC's normal puny speakers.UPDATE: While the built in USB interface does work, a dedicated device with good pre-amps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp. You can simulate all you want (and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions, its like imitation chocolate vs. REAL chocolate. Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo. Amazing sound."
345,580,4.0,"I've tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments I use: electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, violin, and banjo. This one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport. It doesn't get in the way, has rubber feet and padding, and just works simply and effectively. It's not flashy looking, but then it's never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument, or blends in because of its compact size and black color. Nothing else is as versatile and effective, including the multi instrument stands, the ones with other shapes of the support arms, and other folding designs. This is simply the ideal."
829,580,3.0,"works as advertised, good construction, folds easy, holds acoustic or electric, does not nock over easy or at all.  good product"
553,580,4.0,This stand is sturdy and my guitars &#34;seat&#34; like an anchor.  I use one for my electric and another for acoustic.  Will be getting another as soon as I get daughters new guitar.
663,580,4.0,"This guitar stand is as basic as you can get.Has padding where it needs it to protect guitar.Sets up in seconds.Provides good stability and displays guitar nicely.Perfect stand as long as you don't have others(roomates,kids,pets,etc.,who may bump it and knock it over)."
28,580,1.0,Cheap. The best way to describe this stand. It serves it's purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand.
357,580,4.0,"Works great, does what it should, holds all my guitars securely.  acoustic and electric, but not at the same time.  haha"
973,580,4.0,I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand. I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over. This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over. Small and sturdy. I use it at practice and during our live shows. You can't go wrong with this.
869,580,3.0,"I like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily. The biggest down side is the angle that the guitar sits, the lean is to far back so you'll need to keep it further from walls than usual. Other wise good deal."
84,580,4.0,"I bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection. Cheap but work. Nothing fancy...just functional. Nothing more to say, but it said I needed 1 more word."
1317,580,4.0,I needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons. This worked well for that.
934,580,4.0,"YES, DEAR READER, THIS STAND WILL WORK AS A GOOD SUPPORT STAND FOR NOT ONLY MY GRAND CONCERT SIZE ACOUSTIC GUITAR, FOR  MY FIVE- STRING BANJO (WITH RESONATOR), AND.ALSO  FOR MY BARITONE UKULELE.  THE STAND IS.STURDY, PROVIDES GOOD SUPPORT, AND LOOKS GOOD.  I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. AND WILL PROBABLY BUY ANOTHER JUST LIKE IT FOR MY BANJO. THE PACKAGE ARRIVED IN TIME AND WAS PROTECTED BY AN ADEQUATE SHIPPING CONTAINER.."
106,580,2.0,"Just barely gets the job done...I have a Fender Jazz Bass Standard.  The shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing.  It is very low quality, not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly.  Its JUST good enough, but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open, I would be constantly worried about it falling over.  I will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future."
865,580,4.0,"Simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively. Good value. Low to the ground, so balance is not an issue."
1136,580,4.0,"Inexpensive and practical. You don't have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this - just about any angle will work. Needs little space, another plus."
61,770,4.0,"I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago. Recently, I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp. After tracing the issue, I discovered there was some play in the Strat's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip. A quick fix was to bend the jack's connector end, but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open, making a minor gap where there wasn't that positive connection.I've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work. Stronger, more flexible metal, easy soldering, good materials. It's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection. Obviously, because the finish is chromed, oxidation can get in the way of the connection, but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied. If oxidation/wear is an issue, Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks. However, I just love these jacks, and for the price, they really can't be beat."
878,770,4.0,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! THE SAME AS THE OLD ONE I GOT IN MY BC RICH WARLOCK NETCK TRU
1071,770,4.0,"What really can you say about Switchcraft, they just make good solid parts.  Grab one, drop it in and replace that old broken import jack."
671,770,4.0,I didnt have any issue with this when I went to put it in my strat build. Not a lot to say about it really. Its metal and it works. Switchcraft is usually a good product.
1326,276,2.0,"It's smaller than i thought, it works fine and it picks the string really fast. It does only tune in the regular A tune (so E, A, D, G, B, E). So since it's a gift for my father in law it works just fine, but since I use a A flat tuning for my Gibson, and even lower (G) for my Jackson it doesn't work for me."
714,276,4.0,This a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner.  The letters are big so you don't have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune.  Clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning.
356,276,3.0,"I've been using this for a month or so and it works as described.  Some people rate this above the Snark devices, but I cannot.If I were to choose, I'd go for the Snark but this is still an acceptable tuner."
101,276,2.0,"Tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially.  Little harder to read than I would have liked, especially in sunlight.  It would be nice if there was a sound feature.  One other thing that I had in mind, so I'll say it here.  the people that purchase these should put out a Model that Says BLUEGRASS, and this 'blue' tuner would be an even bigger hit."
5,276,4.0,"This is one of the best tuner I have had, what a great value for a low cost.  Thank to all for selling this Guitar Tuner at Amazon."
972,548,4.0,Great little piece of leather. Does what I want it to do and does not hurt my guitar. Thank you
952,548,3.0,"I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck.  They are a great idea.  I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap, but eventually got it on.  I have two of these, and I use them.  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn't like tying on their guitar straps."
1407,548,4.0,"If you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new Martin guitar, this is a must have product. I didn't want to have a hole drilled in a new Martin guitar, so this worked fine wit the Martin leather straps. Actually I bought two of them..... It is a 5-star product."
311,548,3.0,"this is a great item.and works as reported.It seemed to be in my fretting hands way a little,but its ok"
147,548,3.0,"I received this yesterday in my order.  It fits on my guitar fine, but I can't seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap.  The button is so rounded and smooth, that my guitar strap just won't go over the top of the button.  Not sure what to do now."
351,548,4.0,This is an attractive leather head stock strap.  The leather is very soft and flexible. I would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather.
688,445,4.0,"I have other capos and decided to try this one, and I have to say I love it! I have used the Kyser (spelling?) for years as my favorite, and that is a good capo - but I will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz. I will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up - but I love it so far.I use it on my Taylor 910ce, Taylor 718e and my Epiphone Anniv accoustic."
964,445,4.0,"I bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful out-of-tune twang with my previous Planet Waves capo when I would try to reset the capo on a different fret.  Planet Waves capos are awesome, don't get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully."
1162,445,4.0,"First let's get the easy stuff done with.  This capo is beautiful,  It is clean with an even silver matte finish that looks good in the box (nice packaging) and equally good on the guitar.The capo is solid, the spring mechanism feels good in the hand and when it clamps down on the neck you can see (and hear) there was thought put into the capo to make sure the pressure on the string is even and the neck is well protected. No sharp points to damage the guitar.  And this thing is easy to use, squeeze, put on neck, done.  You could easily move this during a gig and then store it on the edge of your neck when not using it.  I tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both.  When playing the strings behave as normal.  No odd muting or dropouts.  The capo is solid on the neck.I have to say I have not used a capo in a while because the one I have is pain.  With this new capo I am happy to use it.  This thing is great!  Easy to use, efficient, sturdy, looks nice and SOUNDS GREAT!"
488,445,4.0,"Good spring action, made pretty solid. No buzzing on the strings when I put it on. The lifetime warranty is what I am stoked about I will probably buy two more for my other guitars. Highly recommend it."
1114,445,4.0,"Fit perfect to my Taylor T5 and no cons I can find so far. If you want a capo for guitar, this one is the one stop shopping for you."
249,401,2.0,"I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon Vine review program.  I was excited to receive them, as I've looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and 'professional grade' designation.I'm not an audiophile, nor am I snob about audio devices.  Any brand that works well at the right price, I'll buy it.  That being said, I've recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones, with theBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones - Blackbeing the most recent.Obviously the Bose beat the TASCAM ones, so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that 'sound wise' you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range.  These TASCAM TH-2000-R 'Professional Grade' Headphones don't sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges.  Bass is great, but even when tweaking the equalizer settings I never could find the clarity I was seeking in the full range.I listened to several genres: Classical, Blues, Pop, Rock, Electronic, Country, and Latino with these headphones.  Each time, the quality was good, but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iPhone, PC andYamaha RX-V675 7.2 Channel Network 3D AV Receiver with Airplay (Black).The fit of the headphones is big for me.  Usually, they are too small.  Having them as small as I could make them (top of my head to ears), the cups still dropped down a bit lower than I liked. I had to hold them in place to get a solid fit.  The padding underneath the headpiece is minimal, and after about 15 minutes of use the top of my head hurt.The build quality of these phones appears to be excellent. The cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6'.  The screw on adapter: 1/8(3.5mm) to 1/4(6.3mm) allows for use with multiple devices, stereo components and sound boards.  The foldable design does allow for some size reduction, but not much.These headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass.  Great for those who want the chunky headset look, are on the go DJing, and/or have larger heads.They are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening.  They're also not for those with smaller heads."
57,401,3.0,"These headphones are almost perfect. The sound is great, good balance between highs and lows. They are comfortable too as far as ear pads go. The only problem is the size. These are for people with big heads, or who wear headphones over a hat, or who are buying headphones for their pet grizzly bear. Maybe all the people at Tascam have really big heads. Mine is average, and these slide down because the headband is too large even at the smallest setting. So minus one star for that. Otherwise, sound quality is excellent. Comes with a 1/4 inch adapter, which is nice. Good price."
804,401,1.0,"The TASCAM TH-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! They are great! Excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs. To boot, they are extremely comfortable as well. The foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face. They are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these. The only drawback that I can see, and I don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. Some people may not like that. All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! By the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer. Kudos to Tascam for making such good headphones!May 12, 2014 UPDATE ------These headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly. I have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working. What a disappointment!!!"
1198,401,2.0,"These headphones really seem to be built pretty well, so it is with some regret that I have to report that I don't like them.The sound reproduction is not flat, and it has a distinct bass heaviness that I can't use when recording or mixing.  In addition to the bass-heavy delivery, there seems to be a dip in the upper mids, a boost in the low mids, and a rolling off of the high end.  This just doesn't work for me in the studio.  The overall size of the headphones is large and they won't fit well for people with smaller heads.  I had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and didn't fit on their ears properly.  I checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they were.This is a shame, as TASCAM make some fine products and are a good name.  I have owned four DA-88 recorders, many field recorders, and three different portable recorders from them, all of which have been great. I am certainly not saying anything bad about the company, but their headphones are just put out there to be low-priced headphones that are not suited to a professional studio.I have used theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone [Electronics] for decades now and I still recommend them.  I have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong, barring replacing the ear padding.  The Sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more, and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio work.I would also recommend theAKG K 240 MK II Stereo Studio HeadphonesorAKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphonesover the TASCAM reviewed here.  The AKG perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though, so that would need to be taken into account."
942,211,3.0,"I was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once.  I do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on.  The only issue I have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune (1 red bar) but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat.  So for me it is a quick check while I am in between songs, anything with 2 bars or more will get more attention."
625,211,4.0,"This thing rocks! Best quality than polytune  1, lighter and best switch. Brighter screen. Simply the best for fast tuning"
108,211,4.0,"I had just purchased a Polytune about 6 months to 1 year ago, and was a little annoyed when I saw ads for the Polytune 2.  Mine was still brand new to me and worked really well.  But after reading and watching about the improvements in this update I decided to take the hit, sell mine for a loss of $20 and get the new one.  A GREAT choice.  This Polytune 2 is amazing - bright, accurate (strobe option), well built...did I say bright?...improved foot switch... It's just another example of TC hitting it out of the park yet again.  Highly recommend getting one of these, you know, unless you want to grab a 1st gen for a deal... ;)"
803,211,2.0,I personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner. The reason why is the LED lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage. The pitch black is nice and bold and bright. One reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time. So its a give and take issue.
83,211,4.0,"This pedal is great help on stage. It's fast and accurate, and with polytune &#34;option&#34; you can easily find which string is out of tune."
818,476,4.0,"First off this is a overdrive pedal with a MOSFET circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion. The pedal is very good at this. There are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp, this is on par with the warm tone of another EHX pedal, the Big Muff Fuzz. The tone function is kindof useless to me I like to keep it on, With the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh. Don't let that keep you from checking this hot rod out. I love mine. Its a keeper."
281,476,2.0,"Tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just OK to me.  It does need a hot signal going in to sound good, so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups.  The distortion is fuzzy, but not fuzz, almost like a fuzzy static.  The EQ switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so I always have the tone in the circuit. I used it with a vintage Vibrolux Reverb. This is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal.  I am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me.  It is made well. For the money I am not mad I tried it."
1157,476,4.0,"The EXH Hot Tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint.  I had no knowledge of or experience with the original full-sized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970's.  And, frankly, many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering.  I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims (both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing) to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier.  Really, though, if you think about it, doesn't EVERY overdrive pedal (including the venerable Tubescreamer) make that same claim?When I plugged into the Hot Tubes, I was surprised, but immediately intrigued.  I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive, which was very good, but also a very &#34;familiar&#34; sounding clone of a TS-808.  What the Hot Tubes does is anything but &#34;familiar&#34; from an affordable OD pedal.This pedal has a significant amount of output, and (unlike many other overdrives) it has considerable low end.  In fact, it likely even adds bass to your sound.  There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand.  Basically, with the switch off, there is no tone control, and they advertise this sound as &#34;powerful&#34; and touch-responsive. Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things, however, I actually left it in the &#34;on&#34; position and worked the tone from the 12:00 to 1:30 settings.The gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique, though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp.  From the 7:00 (0%) setting up to around 12:00, your tone basically remains clean, provided you started with a clean signal.  My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2, which is a tube/hybrid amp with a great clean &#34;Blackface&#34; setting.  However, the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone.  That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime, but the Hot Tubes offered a thick, smokey tone that was mostly clean, with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into it.As you start get past 12:00 on the overdrive knob, the amount of gain increases exponentially.  At this point, the pedal behaves more like an overdrive, though the gain is almost fuzz-like.  Some people have described it as a &#34;Jack White&#34; type of sound, but I'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &#34;like&#34; it or not.There are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about.  First, I want to make clear that this is a DARK, bassy pedal.  In that respect, it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive, both of which have some measure of bass drop.  The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit, but it could do more.  I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with - it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it.  If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side, you may want to stay away from this pedal.  That being said, I would definitely recommend &#34;try before buy&#34; with this one because it is different in hard-to-describe ways.For now, my rating is 5 stars - solid EHX construction, very compact, accessible 9V jack (on the top where it I like it), and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives I have.  It certainly won't be for everybody, but so far, I like what I hear."
536,415,4.0,"This thing is incredibly cool.  Double the record time of the closest competitor- the TC Ditto- and about twenty bucks cheaper.  Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing.  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release.  It was worth the wait.  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music.  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing.  Operation is simple- press once to record.  Press again and it begins playback.  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer.  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub.  Tap twice to stop play of the loop.  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing.  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click.  It is very responsive to pressure.  There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop.  Nicely done, Digitech ;)"
1316,415,4.0,"At the time of me writing this review, these little guys are hard to find and keep selling out quickly.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on one early.  I almost purchased the very nice Ditto Looper when I started looking for a small and simple looper pedal.  The Ditto is great and should be considered if you are in the market for a tiny looper pedal that does nothing but loop well and at an affordable price.  That said, the Digitech Express XT is a little better.  Both work well but the Digitech has a few more features in almost as small of a foot print.  Here are those features.  The Digitech takes batteries or a power adapter, is cheaper than the Ditto, has 5 more minutes of looping memory, can be daisy chained to other Digitech loopers for multi-tracking and they synch, has LED lights so you know where you are, and it has stereo in/out.  None of these are deal breakers alone but together and currently for 30 bucks less, the Digitech Express XT is the clear winner IMHO if you can find one to buy."
503,415,3.0,"Sound quality is great. I also have the very first JamMan with the add on 3 button footswitch.  I wanted a smaller footprint so I purchased this.  Don't expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though.  In a band setting, your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record, stop and playback.  Slightly more difficult than the BIG JamMan Looper but very usable.  This blows away the Ditto pedal by another manufacturer......I had that one first and it is horrible to use....sold it.I am happy with it and use it live in a 3 and 4 piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when I am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages.  Excellent quality.  It has a lot of great syncing features but I do not use those.  Find a youtube video to see all of its potential.  Best looper for the money."
827,415,0.0,"I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour. The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique. The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. This makes the unit useless.Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high. Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It's going back to the store where I purchased it."
1109,456,4.0,"remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store?Sticky Hands - 12 per unitThese are kinda like that, but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1"" x 2"".you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed. They even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!The closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect. You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed. If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them.I've been using them for years and they work amazingly!"
143,456,0.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. Save your money. We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now."
1087,456,4.0,"These really do work well, but it is a difficult struggle to get them separated at 1st. They stick together too well and it is hard to separate them at 1st without ripping the individual pads. I found it a little easier putting them in the fridge over night, then slowly pulling them apart. I also thought about heating them a little or perhaps adding a few drops of water. However chilling them did work well enough. That aside, these will greatly improve the way any set sounds. I've been a pro drummer for over 45 years, and have used masking tape, little cloth squares tapped down, lots of different things. There work best by far and are easily moved around depending on the room you are in and the sound you want. Great stuff. Oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills. That can help and a great drum doesn't sound so good if it isn't tuned right."
1214,456,4.0,"these work better than anything else I ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording, think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well."
1177,492,3.0,I seem to have problem with getting it to &#34;hear&#34; low E (of all strings) but it is very compact and convenient to use.
339,492,2.0,I love these clip-on tuners. I have several but this is the first one I purchased that is a bit of a pain because there is not angle adjustment for viewing it easily. I have to move the guitar neck to see it right and that makes it inconvenient.
327,492,4.0,"Added December 5:Has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the 5 star rating stands without an asterisk.Added November 8:I put the star back.  I've got (another) one on one of my banjos.  It does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck (either mine or the banjo's!) to see it clearly, but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and there's no neck to snap.While it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddle's scroll, it seems firmly rooted to the banjo's headstock.-------------------------Original November 4:This tuner has a display like the SN-8 rather than the SN-1 after which it is named. It's like any other Snark Super tight Tuner.I've taken off 1 star for two reasons:(1) I find I have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it. Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right place to put it.  I'll keep trying.(2) My music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time.  It was clamped solidly on the scroll but, to do that and have it be comfortable to read, the tuner was hanging down while playing.  Eventually it slipped off.  If it weren't kept on, this wouldn't be an issue, but that's how the advertising shows the tuner being used--clamped to a guitar headstock, hanging down. I'll report back if it doesn't happen again for a while. Even if this *is* an issue, its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use, so I still think it's worth 4 stars."
272,492,1.0,The larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so I thought this might be the answer.  The answer is to treat your larger Snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it.  I have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display.  I'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use.  It is cheap though.  Still to me it was money out the window.
554,492,4.0,"I've purchased many Snark tuners. For my young guitar students, they are the easiest for them to use. Very stable and they make tuning a joy.This new Snark is compact and is also fast, stable and easy to read. My one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use. I have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it. They need to rethink the design.But overall, I like it. I'll still keep my older Snarks and continue to use this one as well."
1386,492,3.0,"The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that I've noticed it's response is a little less than the original (bulky) Snark SN-1. I must admit I haven't checked out a new battery, as with my original Snark, a new battery made a big difference. But the size is something that cannot be beat (the original Snark is a little ungainly) and this tuner really fits beautifully on my Strat. I have a Boss Tu-2 stompbox tuner and am thinking of freeing up my pedal board real estate and using this instead.Overall, this is a definite buy."
163,492,4.0,This thing is TINY and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark. This is the only tuner you need!
1010,0,4.0,"This works well.  Has nice ergonomics, fits all of my acoustic guitars, and is easy to use.  No adjustments are required for my guitars, but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo.This capo comes with a pick holder.  And, it is expandable with aD'Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm.  I do not use a pick, and I use my own tuners, so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs.This capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars, the other one being theG7th Performance Capo.  The G7 capo goes with my Takamine New Yorker, and this Planet Waves goes on everything else.  If anyone needs to use a capo, I loan out myKyser Capo.Recommended."
378,0,4.0,"I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one.  However, it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint.  Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included.  This bracket holds the NS micro tuner, of which I have 3.  I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications.  However, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need.  A simple modification, but bordering on genius.  The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed.  Highly recommended."
89,0,4.0,"I have been playing guitar for more years than I care to admit. Okay I bought a 1966 Telecaster brand new back then. Still have it and love it. I have a lot of different guitars, mostly electric, and 4 acoustics. On my electrics I love extra light 8 gauge strings. (Only about 5% of us do) I can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings. Anyhow I digress, but for a reason. Light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the .050&#34; found on Gibons and ESP-LTD's. When you squeeze the string to fret it, with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board. With X-Large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune. The cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as 10's or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board. So most capo's work with 10's and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings. So a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone.So since I use lighter gauge strings, and even 9's are subject to the same limitation, I have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board, and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp. Guess what? Now I found it. I have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one. To be honest with you I was surprised when it worked.Okay so here is how I put it to the test. I used the Snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it. I also have the Peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy. Okay back to the explanation.With the Snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side. The only problem is that most any headstock tuner I have seen they aren't superbly accurate. (The Peterson headstock tuner I sent back because it was acting crazy. Anyhow...) So the secret to using the Snark which I like best out of the headstock tuners I have tried is to tune the open string first, and then fret the string on let's say the 5th fret. You will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune, even though it may be a little sharp, or a little flat, so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it, so your ears can hear it, in order to get it spot on. There is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar, and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune.So by tuning the open string, and then tuning the fretted string, once both are in tune it is right on. So in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp, not enough to register on the tuner, when you fret that string, for example on the 5th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit, making it sharper, which will now show on the Snark as a note that is too sharp. Once you balance the open string, and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument. You don't even need to hear it. So your audience is not listening to you tune up, yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well.So with that being said you can more fully understand why this D'Addario NS Artist Capo is the cat&#8217;s meow. It is the first tuner that I ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck. (It is adjustable like the others are, but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well)You often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo; not with this one even with light gauge strings. I must admit I was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper, after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on, that it immediately did the job just right. It wasn't even a little bit sharp.To be super critical here is another tip. When using this capo put it closer to the fret, rather than in the middle between two frets. For some reason it stretches the string less in doing so. It has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret, rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets. I did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets. (With 8 gauge strings)Since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use, not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune. The best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example, rather than right below the third one. Right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also, just like right above the second one does, but it keeps the capo way out of your way. As a matter of fact I am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords, that I sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong. With a little practice, or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that. To say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand. You just slide it down to being right above the fret below it, rather than right below the fret above it.So there it is. This Capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp. Of course if it can accurately handle 8's it will breeze through anything thicker. Out of the box it is set at its lightest setting, and that is perfect for 8's on the Telecaster I tried it on. Teles and Strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks. So it will work the same with both.So I guess I can't recommend this capo high enough since it is the ONLY one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings. My only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when using a different guitar. I might get another one for a backup."
1232,0,2.0,"I completely agree with &#34;JPfromOH&#34;.This Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly.The micro-adjusting knob for tweaking tension/pressure is nice, but I've wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar/ukulele that I have.  (A standard tension spring might be a bit too firm, but at least it's consistent.)I also thought I'd like the curved cradle for the neck, but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele. I know, I know, this isn't designed for ukuleles, but I have no such troubles with my Kyser capos.I don't understand the clip for a tuner on this thing.  I have several clip-on tuners that clip directly to the headstock. (And most are Planet Waves already!)  Why would I want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when I'm using the capo?  I suppose that if you have money to burn, this is a useful addition.And the pick holder is a nice touch, but... I use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me.As others have noted, there are other, better capos out there."
1041,0,4.0,For years I used Kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue. Planet Waves' NS has a smoother handle that doesn't stick out as much and i've had no issues with gripping it on or off so far. It is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly. If you're looking to buy a capo i'd recommend this over a Kyser.
472,0,1.0,"The tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo I've ever used - and I've tried many over the years. But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? It's awkward to apply and remove quickly. It's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck -  but even that doesn't fly. Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb. The surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style. It doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. If I cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but I wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest I wouldn't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.The only other capo I've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. I have one and, as good as the holding action is, I've never felt comfortable with the design. The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo!"
269,0,4.0,"I own several capos, but this is the first with an adjustable tension.  Several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck.  I picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the NS Artist. There wasn't a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when I compared the capos, but when I compared them from the 5th fret on...there was some slight noticeable differences.  Granted, I had to readjust the tension on the NS Artist. Why readjust?  The neck's character changes slightly as you get nearer the body, and to ensure that I had just enough and not too much tension (after all that's why it's adjustable), I readjusted the tension.  The tonal differences were more noticeable when I played softly, and less when I cranked down.  All in all...not a bad capo."
804,0,1.0,"I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos, but this new one is not very well designed. The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards. I find my left hand hitting the lever when I'm in open position. Frustrating. It does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an NS tuner, which can also be handy. I just think it could have been better designed. I don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. I'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser."
914,0,3.0,"This is one of the nicer capo's Ive used.  Certainly superior to the old school band-based jobs from yesteryear.  One of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab, position, release and go.  Heck, you could probably place it mid-song if you were so inclined to do so.Also it clamps without bending the strings.I've used it on my Start, Les Paul and Martin all with no complaints. I hardly ever use a capo, but if I need one, I am glad to have this one."
544,0,4.0,"I own Dunlop, Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos.  I don't like the direction the Dunlop faces, it seems awkward.  The Kyser spring is very poplar, but I think the spring tension is too strong, making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp.  I like the G7th Nashville Capo, but the spring tension is inconsistent.  The used to be softer, maybe too soft, but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille.  Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos, but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations. Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better."
242,0,2.0,"The Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo seems like a classic case of trying to do everything and not quite getting it right as a result.  The capo has a micro-adjusting knob, but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars, such as my Seagull that have non-standard width fretboards.  The built-in pick holder is useful, but Planet Waves offers another, less &#34;Artist&#34; model that also has one.  In fact, the other Planet Waves capo I have is much more amenable to different width necks than this one.  The Artist capo also has an adapter that allows The player to attach one of those small clip-on tuners directly too  the capo.  Assuming that you don't use the capo constantly, why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitar's headstock?  Check out other offerings from Planet Waves; you can do better for less than with this one."
399,0,4.0,"Like many modern capos, this has an unwieldy look to it that I don't like, but once I get past that, this is a top-notch capo that is as good as it gets for capos. I play several very different stringed instruments (guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin, tenor banjo and Irish bouzouki), and I like having a capo that I can use on all of them. This is ideally suited for guitar, but holds its own on all the other instruments. I particularly like that there's nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way. I can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck.I really like that fact that it's adjustable, and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin. I also really like theMeideal MCapo10 Bronze Guitar / Banjo / Mandolin Capoas my 'all purpose' capo, and I own several of these because they're inexpensive and just a great product. But this is definitely my new guitar capo, and will replace the Meideal in my case. Great product, solidly built, and it's a bonus that you can add the Micro tuner to the bottom of it.The construction appears to be very solid, and the finish is a flat black baked-on paint (or so it appears). Might be some sort of powder-coating as well. The top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber, and the spring seems very strong with great tension. As noted, it will accept a D'Addario micro tuner on the bottom, and includes the bracket for mounting it."
1329,0,4.0,"Always looking for that elusive perfect capo, light yet strong and dependably firm?You just found it.This is an exemplary capo. No surprise, as it's designed by Ned Steinberger, who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics. It's made of serious aluminum and the spring is super-solid. The tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it won't come off again until you loosen it. No slippage here! This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it's even less in the way of your hand, a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos can't offer.It's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets. The rubber is well-bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least, unlike many cheap capos. It sits well on any six-string, though is not flat enough for a classical. But most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric (unless you're Albert Collins, who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here), so this will cover all your basic capo needs.It's got a little slot for the D'Addario brand tuner, but I use a Snark and these two go together well; put on the capo, activate the tuner on the headstock, tune it up, and away you go, perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo! If you've ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo, this is a godsend combo. The capo also has a little pick slot, which will comfortably take up to about a .73 mm pick. It fits .60 picks perfectly, by the way.This NS Artist Capo is well worth 20-25 bucks, and since I got it my Shubb and Kysers have sat lonely in the corner.If you haven't ever experimented with capos, try them out. They can really change the way you play your guitar, and may help you find you sing better than you think, as we all have our best keys, and a capo can help you find yours. I love playing bluegrass licks in G while capoed at the second fret, for instance. The extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it's almost like another instrument. This goes for every fret, pretty much, up to about the sixth, where it gets a little cramped.All in all, this is the best capo I've ever used, especially for this quality at this price."
819,0,4.0,"This is the best capo we have (out of three). We were not unhappy with the others until we received this one.Pros:Easy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tune.Easy to put on the guitar. Although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they don't buzz, it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fret.Nice pick holder feature.The micro adjuster is easy to adjust. It turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring.Cons:None!This is the capo to get!"
1374,0,3.0,"The capo is pretty good. I like the ability to customize tension. However, it is unclear which way the capo should be put on - with the &#34;pincer&#34; side facing the floor, or facing the ceiling? In either direction, it's a bit awkward to put on/take off, as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly. The Kaiser is still the best, IMO, but you can't adjust the tension on those. Overall, this is good but not great."
1084,0,4.0,"Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that I've ever come across. I've been a Kyser Capo gal for many, many years but, this capo has that one beat by a mile. There was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars I tried it on or which fret I placed it on. As I strummed each string to sound was so clear. It's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open, without any stress to your hand, until you release your grip to clamp it into place.I do believe the folks at Planet Waves have developed the best capo ever! And the price ain't so bad either."
1232,50,4.0,"So, first up:  I've been using Macs to record music since the G4 Cube... yeah, go look that up.  Anyway, I know my way around audio recording on Apple devices.And then: yeah, this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy...BUT: I haven't encountered anything so Plug & Play simple as the Apogee JAM 96k since Gefen introduced the iMic.  Just plug in the USB or Lightning cable, plug in your instrument and GO.Also, it's not flimsy.  It is made of plastic, but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk.It pulls power from your machine, so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings. This also helps those of us using electric guitars that don't have extra-wound humbuckers.I tested the Apogee JAM on a new (2014) MacBook Air, an iPhone 5, and a 2013 iPad Mini.  Garageband instantly knew what was going on, but ProTools did need a bit of coaching.A small device that doesn't color input sound and doesn't get in the way... just what I needed!"
1329,50,4.0,"4.6 starsMy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality. The A/D is often weak, and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi-tracking. Apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy; the A/D is quite smooth, and it transfers the signal near perfectly. And little it is, not much bigger than the jack. If Bon Scott only knew...But small though it may be, there's plenty of signal processing power in there, and while it doesn't stand up my best outboard gear, it offers very clean, clear sound transfers from guitar, bass, keys and line mics, so that you can do good-sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the JAM as interface. Which is yet another step forward in high-quality home recordings. I like the thought that we're getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites, and not paying Crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file. Record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this JAM, and maybe soon enough we'll see artists keeping ALL of the profits from their art. Imagine that!This offers very close to studio quality, but keep in mind that even with 24-bit it is solid state. Once you've used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make. I ran this through one of mine and the A/B made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place.Speaking of Crapple, the ads for this suggest that it is for iStuff only, which is not true. I ran it on 7 Ultimate and it worked a charm, so don't be fooled by the typically proprietary ads, which Cook and co. probably insist on: &#34;Don't mention anybody but us! Offer no alternatives! They must stay in our universe!&#34; Well, you needn't, this works with almost anything, so don't be fooled by the ad copy.The only negative I can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build, making one wonder how good the internals are, and how long they'll hold up. A stronger, more solid sleeve would have been nice, especially at the price of 130. But it does sound good, though as it may be used for portable purposes, you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks don't mess with it. Take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music!"

I was surprised at how small the JAM is.....slightly bigger than a Bic cigarette lighter.  Using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around, and it saves on other's ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings, especially if you are beginner guitarist!Overall pretty good, and very simple to operate.  Just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice.  My daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do."
1067,50,4.0,"I've been recording on my iMac, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone for some time, using Garage Band. Interfacing with the iMac is easy, using various USB devices- I'm currently using a USB-equipped Alesis preamp. iOS device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use USB preamps, with an externally powered USB hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy.  I've been using simple devices like the 1K that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar. The problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good. The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons. First, it contains its own dedicated preamp and A/D, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity. Interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized. I didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables.The JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole I think it's worth it. It's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality. It does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone. You'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions. With the iPad, this isn't as noticeable. Even with that issue, I think the JAM is a good value.  The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input. Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad, the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison."
806,413,4.0,This is the perfect fit for all my basses. I have two Ibanez and two Essex basses. They recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge. I play fingerstyle and they feel great. They have corrosion resistant packaging and since corrosion is what kills your strings the longer you can keep it at bay the better. They are made in  the USA and they use recycled packaging. I cannot attest to their lifespan but the package says long life so we will concede that point.
1041,413,4.0,"I'm mainly a guitarist but I do play bass from time to time on an old Fender American. These strings are very bright in a good way with a clear, smooth sound. I love the tone you get out of these, very bluesy and the punch isn't too rough it's just right. I'm a huge fan of D'Addario, been using their strings for at least 4 years and they never disappoint. Give these a try if you're looking for some new strings."
472,413,3.0,"I put the set on my Squire Jazz Bass with threaded bridge rollers. If you don't like loading up the tuners, trim a few inches off the leads; they're about 8-9 inches and have no cloth covering like Fenders. I usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the FlexSteels have overall less tension. I let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing (yeah, ironic for a set designed for slapping).Gave them a good stretch and they're holding pitch well. I find the windings on the FlexSteels more comfortable than Rotosounds - at least comparing new-to-new. That helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting.Overall I'm more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there's plenty of 'piano low-end sproing' (Squire, Lake and Ray Bennett fans will feel right at home, fingers or pick). The set is so bright-sounding in fact I had to roll a considerable amount off.The label says 'Light Top/Medium Bottom' (45-65-85-105): I found the gauge balance between the low E-A and the high D-G a little more pronounced than I'd like, but not outright uncomfortable."
1378,413,4.0,"I've been using D' Addario strings for 20+ years to great satisfaction.  These flex steels are excellent.  Bass tones, response and resonance are superior to my ear.  You can't go wrong with these guys."
1329,413,4.0,"I play guitar and bass, but the gitpicker in me envies full-time bassists because they almost never break strings, and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings. The price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics. You don't know how good you've got it! And these D'Ad's are very good all-round strings, though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even ""normal"" nickel wound, so they're not for sloppy fingers.Very nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge, these FlexSteels ring nicely and I like that the bottom E is a tad thicker at 105 than the usual light set's 100. Because these are pretty bright, that extra oomph is nice. And I'm a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar, so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that. But if you're popping and slapping, these come through loud and clear. I really like the feel of the low E when I thumb pop with these.I play a P-bass with my index, middle and thumb, and these punch nicely at that scale length. The pickups also like them, and they get plenty loud, with full definition and plenty of top end, but not brittle. With a Trace Elliot or other high-def amp, these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players. I bet Marcus would kill with them.I think these are perfect for funk, and excellent for almost all rock styles. Obviously flats are better for jazz, but these make a good all-around string and for less than 20 clams they're a great deal."
106,413,4.0,"A great set of bass strings with all the right features:- Perfect balance of bright/punch and warmth- Right, deep tones- Great feel and playability- Stable tuning- &#8220;Textured round&#8221; design with hexagonal core shape- Durable- Easy to stringMy father uses D&#8217;Addario on his telecaster and acoustic guitars, which originally prompted me to choose D&#8217;Addario for my Fender Jazz bass.  I can say that the brands&#8217; reputation carries over to bass&#8212;these are phenomenal strings."
1067,413,3.0,"I've been using D'Addario XL nickel wounds on my P-Bass for a long time. They have a lot of tone, they seem to last a long time, and they're not very expensive. These strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds, but are a lot brighter You get lots of overtones and high end from these. The choice of gauges is a little different from the regular XLs, too; instead of the .085 A and the .100 E they have a .085 A and a .105 E. That's just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end, and more metal to dig into, while retaining low tension in the D and G. I'm more of an old-school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound, but if you're into funk or more modern sounds, you may feel that the bright SS sound is for you, and if so, these are a great string."
636,413,4.0,"I have to admit this up front - I'm a terrible bass player. I play guitar and keep a bass in the music room for times when I have friend over to jam. I do dabble with the bass, but I'm not proficient with it. That being said; I really appreciate the difference these strings make in sound, playability and durability. These strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time. They have &#34;punch&#34; and &#34;snap&#34; which are good things to have in a bass. I haven't had them on for a real long time, but in the time I've had them they remain consistent and show absolutely no sound or metal degradation in the time they've been on my Fender MIM Jazz bass. When I need another set, I'll buy these!"
22,413,4.0,"These are some bright strings!I play with a pick and mostly stay in the realm of rock 'n' roll, so no comments on the slapping and popping claims the packaging makes, but there are plenty of great rock tones to be found.  Heck, crank the amp and dig in with a pick and these would be great strings for any Motorhead covers you're planning on playing!  Good bright steel tone, not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips (or frets!) as Rotosounds, and they're only a Jackson, not a bad string!"
1371,10,4.0,"Likes:- Pretty smooth.  Minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some- Bright, strong mids.- They do seem to stay in tune well.  Havent had to change tuning once they settled in.Will update this review with more experience as I play on these strings over the next week."
955,10,3.0,"My daughter is learning how to play and the .11 - .48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain.I put a set of the D'Addario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up. Usually, I've had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch, but the D'Addario's seemed to do a much better job. I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly. The wound strings also seem quite stable. Frequently, it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in, but I've seen no such issues with the D'Addario's.I usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone, but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually like.My daughter is also very happy with them since they're not quite so tough on her fingers."
89,10,4.0,"I have preferred Ernie Ball Extra Lights which is a nickel string. They have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference. The NYXL's have a brighter tone, good playing ease, and stay in tune better when making new string changes. If you have a mahogany body guitar such as the Les Paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match, or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies.These are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are. Pertaining to output I am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in &#34;acoustic/unamplified&#34; output, but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears.These do stay in tune better than my usual Ernie Balls nickels when you first put them on. The nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch. These have their tension adjust better on the first day of use. After the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference. I find that by lightly sanding the nut with 1000 grit paper, and using Big Ben's Nut Sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other. Having these NYXL's on there is just one more added benefit.I would say if you are looking for a brighter tone, with better tuning stability, these are the ones to have. You can tell from the wall to wall 5 star reviews these are the one to have."
57,10,4.0,"I normally get Elixir strings, but these sounded too good to pass up. They are indeed some high tech strings, with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability. Plus they feel and sound good. So grab a pack and get jamming. You'll definitely want to check these out."
849,10,3.0,"At about twice the price of their standard strings, These D'Addario NYXL strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability, higher breaking point, and something called &#34;fusion twist&#34; (which I swear is a rare Chubby Checker B-side).Having just put a set of these on one of my guitars, I can't speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings, but I can say they are solid, dependable strings with lots of &#34;punch and crunch&#34;."
806,10,4.0,Great strings with a good feel to them. They are size 10-46 which is just right for my electric guitars. I won't know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey. If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time. I don't think of these as extra lights (09-42) they are more of a light to me.
669,10,4.0,"I'm a long time D'Addario user. From the time I started playing I've tried most of the different brands out there and always end up back with my D'Addarios. I got the .09's to try on my Strat and the .10's to try on my LP and found that these new NYXL strings do have a little better output and stay in tune a little better but the trade off is the cost. Currently they're $11.99 on here compared to $4.99 or less for the regular version. So if you burn through a lot of strings, that may be a consideration. I don't go through strings that frequently (I'll change on each guitar every 2 to 3 months) so it's not a big concern for me."
1041,10,4.0,"I've used D'Addario strings for years and they never fail me. These extra light are great for playing lead as they're easy to bend and feel great on your fingers. As they are extra light strings, they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear. For a brand as a whole i'd recommend D'Addario strings to any guitarist and for gauge it's really dependent on play-style and role if you are in a group."
472,10,4.0,"I usually play an .11 on top and first grabbed my digital caliper to confirm the gauge of the high E in this set &#8211; it felt heavier than a .10, but the LED doesn&#8217;t lie and it confirmed .10.I put the NYXL set on my Ibanez Artist with DiMarzio  humbuckers. I stretch new strings out of habit; I don&#8217;t like the constant slipping as they settle.  I stretch all six strings in about 4-5 segments up the neck, retune, and hope for the best.There&#8217;s no whammy bar on the Artist and, for the first few days, I did a lot of blues bending to see how they&#8217;d hold up - the NYXLs stayed in tune very solidly with only minor tweaking as to be expected with any strings.I chose a darker-sounding guitar than a single-coil Fender, hoping the supposed brightness of the NYXLs would be more noticeable. On this guitar I usually play D&#8217;Addario XLs and an Ernie Ball &#8216;pink&#8217; set on my Strat so I&#8217;ve got two points of reference.In terms of tone, from the start the NYXLs sound much closer to &#8216;broken in&#8217; than the Ernie Balls. There&#8217;s far less &#8216;new jangle&#8217; to them and, while they&#8217;re bright, they&#8217;re manageable for the kind of tone I&#8217;m after. I play jazz in a more contemporary vein &#8211; in terms of tone more Scofield and Abercrombie than Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall.  I like a rich tone with some high end but without too much &#8216;klang&#8217;.In terms of feel and tension the NYXLs are stiffer and closer to the regular XLs than to Slinkys, which is probably to be expected. But oddly, the windings of the low E-A-D remind me a bit more of the Ernie Balls than XLs, whose windings feel a bit wider.Three weeks on, with the onset of warm humid weather around here the strings are showing no rust and still sound fresh.With so many players going through modeled amps and effects it&#8217;s a fair question just how much the tonal quality of electric strings still matters &#8211; or are we headed for &#8216;virtual strings&#8217; designed mostly for durability and intonation. Will we be dialing in &#8216;new and klangy&#8217;, &#8216;broken in with worn windings, or &#8216;sweated through and rusty&#8217;.I like to believe there are enough players out there young and old still fussy about tone and the role a good set of strings plays in delivering it.  To them I&#8217;d say these are worth checking out."
269,10,4.0,"I've been using Ernie Balls cobalt slinky light gauge because I like the feel.  I got these from the Vine, and wow, they are awesome.  They cost no more than the strings I normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different.  I can't comment on how long they'll last or keep in tune..but for now, I'm impressed.  I'll probably keep using these on my Santana PRS for awhile since I like the sound.  Every once in awhile, I'll step outside of my box...I mean.. I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them.  I use d'addario on my acoustic guitars, and ernie balls on my electrics..except for my strat..I like fender bullets on it.  So the sample from the Vine...sorta of nudged me..and I'm the better for it."
1378,10,4.0,"I have used D' Addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel, playability, tone and reliability.  This set is no exception.  Light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone.  Highly recommend anything by D' Addario."
106,10,4.0,"My father is a full-time gigging musician primarily on Steel Guitar and Telecaster.  He has been playing over 50 years and it takes a lot to get him interested in new strings.  We both use D'Addario strings almost exclusively (myself on bass guitar, and him on the electric).  These are *outstanding* strings with great durability, playability and exceptional sound.  They remain in tune for long gigs or recording sessions, they generate less fret noise than comparable strings and have a bright/crisp sound that really stands out. Well worth the extra investment.  Highly recommended!"
1425,10,4.0,"I've been stringing my guitars with D'Addario for several years.  While my jazz box is set up with heavy strings, my Les Paul goes lighter--horses for courses, you might say.  I've been using D'Addario XL strings on this guitar for a while, although it's the EXL140 (slightly larger bottoms).  But why not give these lighter strings a try?  The quality is obviously high.  Tone is good, as is durability.  If you do much complex chording, you're going to miss the heavier string, but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice.  I'll be going back to the EXL 140s, since I prefer the more positive feel of the larger string.  But fat or skinny, D'Addario makes some of the best strings out there."
386,10,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable. There's a little more &#34;brightness&#34; to the output, they are a little more long-lasting, and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal XL120. This is a good string.But it looks like the going rate on these strings will be 12 bucks a set. I can get three sets of regular (excellent) XL120 strings for that money, and if the NYXL lasted 3 times as long then they'd be worthwhile, but I've been able to try them twice now, and they don't last 3 times as long.Great string, great innovation, great achievement, drastically overpriced."
819,10,4.0,"These have a nice bright sound and are easy on the fingers with a light action. Pretty deluxe strings for the price here on Amazon. I have them on my travel acoustic six string (Martin) and am happy, especially since I am not a &#34;pro&#34; guitarist and my fingers can get sore.I say, get 'em!"
1337,686,4.0,"Just put these on my Martin DCX1E and they sound great! This is a big guitar that really rings out and the Elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone. Playing rhythm guitar, flat picking and fingerpicking.I can't say if they last longer, vine has us review this asap. After daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning. I have used Elixir nano web strings before and I do think they keep their tone a bit longer. That being said, my go to strings are still D'addario."
341,686,4.0,"I ordered this for my husband, the musician. He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel. He would definitely purchase this product...and he's pretty picky about his guitar strings!"
133,686,4.0,"I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to other brands including Martin and D'Addario.  I got a set of these strings as well as the Phosphor Bronze design through the Vine program and chose to this set out on a Seagull Artist Mosaic rather than on a Taylor, Martin or Gibson. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.I have also tried the new Phosphor Bronze strings in this series on a Gibson and had fine results.  Because I did not use both sets of strings on the same guitar, it is not possible for me to really compare/contract the. These strings play as smoothly and easily as do the Phosphor Bronzes and seem to add a good deal of depth to the already resonant mellowness of the Seagull.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments."
269,686,4.0,"I can't speak on the claim for a longer string life.  The strings are true to Elixir's quality and tone.  These strings sound great plug and unplugged.  I also had the opportunity from Vine to try the phosphor bronze too.  There are tonal differences as expected.  The 80/20 are brighter, but the tones are clear and crisp.  When amplified, I did note less finger noise as I re-positioned or slid my fingers along the strings.  I didn't notice any difference to the feel of the string...as compared to other nanoweb Elixir strings that I have used over the years.  Time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions.  For now, even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb ... you're still getting a good deal."
110,686,4.0,Great product with nice feel and tone. I'm only sorry I pre-ordered only two sets at $12.49. The average price now is $15 and over. I'll bite the bullet and order more after I wear these two sets out. Hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time I need new strings. These are durable and long lasting. Recommeded.
399,686,3.0,"I have reviewed these strings before, and frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the tone the first time around. I think they feel great on the fingertips and they're very playable, especially for a picker, but I just wasn't sold on the tone. To be fair, I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars, and found them lacking. There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings (Martin SPs) to these.So this time, I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar. I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20, which is a 000 sized guitar, and they sound terrific. I'm no engineer or physicist, so I really can't explain the mechanics of it all, but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body, and they produce a very clear, bright tone across the higher range, and hold their own on the low range.I still don't think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and I still think they're a bit overpriced, but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect. This seems to have no effect on the tone, but for what these cost, you'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months (I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day).Overall, these are good (but overpriced) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars. You'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them, and which don't. In my experience, large body guitars lose tone, but they sound great on a smaller body."
636,686,4.0,"I had the opportunity to try a set of Elixir Nanoweb light gauge (.013 - .053) strings in both Phosphor Bronze and 80/20 Bronze. Instead of writing a separate review for each, I figured I&#8217;d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs.The Phosphor Bronze strings are mounted on a brand new Guild F-47 RC guitar. It is a concert sized guitar with a Florentine cutaway. The body is Brazilian Rosewood and the top is Adirondack (Red) Spruce. I have always heard that Phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a Rosewood guitar. I would agree. The tone is nicely balanced &#8211; maybe a bit weak in the bass, but the strings are new and in a couple days I expect them to sound a bit better.  The notes are articulated well, and there is a nice midrange tone.The Nanoweb coating is nice. It protects the strings from corrosion (finger sweat really can do a job on strings) without dulling the sound. I think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original (Guild) strings, and it just plays easier.The 80/20 strings are mounted on a Gibson Hummingbird &#8211; an iconic Mahogany body/Spruce-topped Dreadnaught sized guitar. Again, 80/20s are recommended for Mahogany guitars. As popular as the Hummingbird is, I was never totally pleased with the sound of it.  It is a great guitar to strum along with while singing, but it almost sounded too muddied &#8211; not enough articulation between the different strings. The Elixir strings really bring out something extra from the Gibson. It sounds a LOT better and feels easier to play. The strings are easier to play &#8211; partially because of the coating &#8211; partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity &#8211; without going out of tune.The bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes. I am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the Martin SPs that were on it prior to the switch.Elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there, but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings, in the end you won&#8217;t spend more money on what I think are far superior strings."
386,686,1.0,"I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one.But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better).It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34; moniker... no thanks."
1337,65,4.0,"I put these strings on my Guild acoustic electric. I play mainly rhythm guitar to accompany my singing and do a bit of fingerpicking.The warmth of phosphor bronze strings suits my style and these strings have a great tone with crisp high notes and full rich bass ends.They are made by Taylor and all Taylor guitars come with Elixir strings. Saving up for a Taylor, in the meantime, at least I can afford the strings!These are very good long-lasting strings. To me, D'addario are just as good. Things like strings and picks are subjective. Try different brands to find what suits you best. If you are a serious player with a good guitar you should definitely check these strings out."
341,65,4.0,"I ordered this for my husband, the musician.  He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel.  He would definitely purchase this product again."
133,65,4.0,"I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to Martin PB about a year ago (when I acquired a new Martin... Surprise!) I got a set of these strings through the Vine program and chose to try them out on a Gibson Songwriter Studio Deluxe CE RATHER than on a Taylor or Martin. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.They are even smoother and easier to play that I remembered them. Of course, these new strings have improved the technology which becomes more and more important to me as my fingers age right along with the rest of my body. The sound is sweet and warm and the Gibson has never sounded better - played plugged-in or unplugged.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments."
269,65,4.0,"True to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound.  You still get finger noise as you slide your fingers when setting up for the next chord, but the noise is somewhat less. I have used other Elixir nonweb coated strings and these strings are in par with them.  I can't speak to the string life.  The boast of these strings is that will last 3 to 5 times longer, and if that is the case, I will run out of time to submit my feedback.  So far now, they sound great, feel great...and if they don't last as long as the other Elixirs, you'll still come out ahead since they shouldn't cost any more."
804,65,4.0,"I've used Elixirs for about five years now. This set offers the same great sound for my acoustic as their electric strings provide for my electric. Some people don't like the polymer (nanoweb) that coats the string, but I find that it cuts back on string noise. Sliding your fingers around doesn't cause too much noise, and with acoustic strings I find that very important, especially if you're using a piezo pickup in your instrument. Phosphor Bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars IMHO. These are great strings, worth the money, and sound great. They also last 3 times longer than regular, non-coated strings in my experience (been playing for 24yrs). Great product."
1378,65,3.0,"I'm a D'Addario man myself, but hey free is free.  So I jumped at a chance to try these strings out.  Thus far they have proven durable both in terms of playability and longevity of tone.  So many other variables to consider when rating strings such as the guitar they go on, the gauge of string being used, the playing style and climate of the end user, etc.  These are a solid performing string set, though I am unlikely to switch allegiances from D'Addario any time soon.  Still there is no reason to fear trying these Elixir's out."
399,65,2.0,"I have lots of friends who play these strings. Some love them more than any other string, and some are like me. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get past the sound. It could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars, but in any case, I'm not happy with the sound and that's why I have a hard time giving them a solid five-star rating.I tried these on two separate guitars I play regularly, and wasn't terribly impressed with the sound on either. One is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone, and is crisp, clear and fairly loud. These strings softened the tone, which I wasn't looking to do. They sound okay, but nowhere near as good as the Martin SPs I use to really bring out the best in that guitar.I also have a cutaway electric/acoustic I use to sing with because it's fairly quiet, and the softer tones don't drown out my voice. These strings made the guitar even more quiet, and there was a considerable drop-off in tone quality as well. They might have been cheap, old strings, because I couldn't tell that there was anything special about them. This particular guitar didn't have spectacular sound to begin with, and these strings did nothing to improve it. I like strings to either sound as good as other strings, or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar. These strings did neither for me. However, they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp.Based upon my experimentation, I would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and you're not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality, you'll love the way these strings feel and play. I rate them excellent in that category. But for me, tone is 80% of the equation. I'd play wire-wrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings. In the tonal category, these strings fell short. On a guitar with excellent tone, I noticed a distinct drop in tone quality, and on another softer, more muted guitar, tone quality vanished.In the final analysis, if you're a picker and your guitar can be plugged in, you'll love these strings. If you're really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesn't have stellar tone to begin with, you might gain some 'playability,' but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality."

990,65,3.0,"I have tried coated strings in the past ( including Elixirs) and have never been very fond of them. Whenever I tried them I felt a certain disconnect from my guitar. Somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom. Not that I hated them, just didn't really love them. These are the best ones I've tried so far. I still don't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off. If you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there. After a dozen or so gigs with them, they still sound the same as when I put them on."
686,65,3.0,"Well, MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 (Rosewood) series guitars that came out this year (2014) ... the promise is a &#34;bolder high end, fuller low end&#34; ... I am a long-time Taylor owner and favor their 800 series (Rosewood/Spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods) ... I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars ... I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs ... I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12-Fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HD's ... took some getting used to as far as feel (due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - E, B & G) ... but as far as sound, they are great ... the D, A & low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of &#34;fuller low end&#34; ... compared to what?  Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD's compared to the regular ... I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PB's but will most likely continue to run the HD's on my 12-fret ... I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ..."
1198,65,3.0,"These strings are really quite good, but I wouldn't call them perfect.  The unwound strings are not quite as bright as I am accustomed to, but they still ring nicely.  This is the only complaint I have about these strings.  If the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter, these would be 5-star strings.  As it stands, I give them 4.5 stars... not a big knock, actually.The low-end on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm.  I put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the &#34;jumbo&#34; aspect of my acoustic.  The sound is very big, full, and nice.Definitely a recommended product!4.5/5 stars"
